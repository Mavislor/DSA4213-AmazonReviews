negative,"PINOCCHIO: The DVD came to our home quickly but it was the incorrect version. Since this was the second time I tried to buy this DVD, I checked on the information provided to make sure it was in the right region. It didn't say region 2 as some of the other DVDs for said so I assumed that it was the correct region. When it came, it was region 2 which we can't use in the USA."
negative,"I'm Disappointed!!: I read the reviews and decided to by this item anyway.... I recieved it with no instructions and no reciept inside of the box. I'm an online shopper and this stroke me as odd! Took the ball out of the box and set it on top shelf of my 20 monthe old baby's TV stand. I have cathedral ceilings so when I turned it on, I absolutely loved it its projection! However, when I returned to my baby's room in a couple of hours to check on him, I noticed the ball had stopped rotating!!!! I tried turning it off and then back on. It started rotating again but the rotation got slower by the second and shortly after, it stopped completely! It seems to me that the power generator isn't strong enough to rotate the big ball! I need a replacement and I hope the ball will be inspected before getting shipped out to me. If it wasn't for the defective malfunction, I'd give it 4.5 stars taking half a point away for the cheap quality of the item...."
positive,"Best portrayal of Pearl Harbor: The attack on Pearl Harbor on Sunday December 7, 1941 was one of the most signifcant events of the 20th century. It secured US entry into World War II which in turn helped in the victory in Europe over Nazi Germany.A key feature of this movie is that it was a joint American-Japanese production and hence gives both perspectives and a balanced picture of the story. It is both a historically accurate account of the events and also a gripping and watchable film.The first half of the movie maps out the events leading up to the attack, the question of why it happened is an important point for any event in history but particularly in this case.The movie's second half is a stunning recreation of the devastating battle. Considering when it was filmed the effects of the battle compare favourably with those of the far more recent Pearl Harbor directed by Michael Bay."
positive,"Brilliant Playing of lesser known works: These are lesser known pieces of Mozart comprising mainly of etudes and unfinished compositions that were rounded off after Mozart's death.Although these pieces are by no means masterpieces, under the wonderful hands of Staier they are given resonance and meaning that confirm the great powers of Mozart as a composer.Of all the pieces, it is Allemende which is the highlight here. The playing is ghostlike. On the fortepiano, the effect is quite chilling and each phrase seems haunted by spirits of the great man himself.The key to all Staier recordings is the use of silence or brief, almost imperceptible pauses which allow the sense of a phrase sink in. He's used this to great effect in his harpsichord recordings of Bach and he re-employs the technique for this recordings of Mozart.In Europe, Staier is considered a modern genius - listen to the Allemende and you'll understand why."
negative,over-rated!: poor acting. somehow has rated 4/5 stars which means 4/5 people that rated it are idiots. has about 3 scary parts total. the acting is horrifying though. scariest part of the movie by a long shot was the acting.
negative,"Hard to Please: These were not comfortable for me. I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet, they hurt. I just have a really hard time finding shoes that don't hurt my feet and these were not them."
positive,"wow! she is so good!: Again - Beautiful voice, beautiful songs, beautiful music!!!I have yet to hear a song from a Laura Fygi's cd that i did not like. This cd is another fantastic one! Buy it and you'll be glad u did. Laura Fygi has an incredible voice."
negative,"He just doesn't have the touch anymore...: Really frustrating to spend all this time reading a book that juts goes nowhere. I just can't believe this was the same author who wrote the runaway jury, a time to kill and the firm. This book was basically like a ""painted house"" with a sprinkle of suspense. Disappointing!"
positive,"roulette girl: After listening to Mary's first release, Blue Skies Over Dundalk, I thought it couldn't get any better than that. Well, Mary has proven me wrong. Roulette Girl is a half hour of deeply emotional yet still witty songs. Anyone with a pulse should own this album."
positive,"Better RED Than Dead: I have red hair, as did my mother and her mother. Other books I have support many theories and facts that MARION ROACH includes in this book about red hair. There were, of course, sections included that strayed from this main topic, but I assume it was the author's well-intended attempt to familiarize/personalize herself with readers so we could learn & know more about her as a person. She is talented and dynamic. I am also gonna bet that she's like me, O-Negative. (REW 9/2009)"
positive,Franklin's Feature: My 4 1/2 year old LOVES it. The first day he watched it 5 times. Not bad for an austic child who dosen't sit still. Not for the very young because of the length (75 mins)Great songs and a wonderful message. For the older child who is going to be big brother or sister this is a great video to watch then talk about what it will be like to be that big brother/sister.
negative,"Adequate, but unclear screen: I was considering buying a dehumidifier, because it feels humid inside my apartment during the summer. I bought this first because I wanted to verify whether it actually IS humid in my apartment. Therefore, I have not used the outdoor sensor. Generally it seems to work fine, but the display must be set at the wrong angle, because it is hard to read from straight on. The numbers are most visible if viewed from an angle, so I would not recommend this product."
positive,"Nine Days is amazing.: I will tell you something now, and that it doea not take 257 weeks to figure out that these dudes have some real talent. Thats all there is to it."
positive,"One of my favorites: This is one of the better Adam Sandler movies I've seen. It is funny and heart-warming, without going over the top. I don't always like Drew, but she does a great job in this one. A really great movie!"
negative,not bad: I stuck my balls in the uranium a day after it arrived and 1 week later they sprouted legs and began to try to run away.It's week 4 and im down to one ball and i have to carry it around in a cage :/
negative,"I HATE THESE DIAPERS!!!!: I can't even begin to count the number of times I have been nursing my baby in the middle of the night and he has wet through his Pampers Dry diaper and it has gone all over me!!! These diapers are horrendous!!!! The only reason I used them last night was because I ran out of Huggies Overnites. I will never use them again!!!! I have been up since 4:15 because after I had to change my son's diaper and my clothes - he is now wide awake!!! Come up with a better night time diaper, Pampers!!! I'm going to the store to buy more Huggies as soon as my husband wakes up!!!!"
positive,"nice shirt but sizing inconsistent: This shirt seems to be made of the same, good quality, wicking fabric that my previous Adidas shirts were made of. Unfortunately, however, I am currently unable to wear this shirt comfortably. Even though Amazon's description says this is a ""loose fit"" shirt and I ordered and received the same size of shirt that I've purchased before (in many brands), this shirt is simply too tight on me for comfort. If I had absolutely no bodyfat, I wouldn't mind this form fitting shirt. With a bit of love handle action going on, however, a cut like this only accentuates the bodyfat.Buyers should be aware of this prior to ordering this shirt. Perhaps I simply received a shirt that was improperly sized and isn't really a medium after all, but if the shirt I received is representative of the normal cut of this shirt then I would say that this shirt is anything but loose fitting."
negative,"Quit working after 2 days: The charger quit charging my Blackberry 8100 after 2 days. The fuse isn't blown because the LED still works. Yes, it was very cheap, but was hoping to get more than 2 days out of it."
negative,"Starts out with promise, but then goes downhill.: Too bad Adam Sandler could not have been given a better script. Funny People starts with promise as a Jim Carrey Man on the Moon type film and then drifts oddly into some sort of romantic comedy with repetitive c**k jokes. There are two movies here made from what seems like two first drafts. Maybe it is a marketing problem. Or, maybe just lazy writing. Sandler does a great job showing off the dark side of a comedian. Maybe Funny People would have been better as a straight drama."
negative,"Livingstonia: The quality of the paper is very poor.Photographs not clear, you cannot even make out the faces of the people in the photos.The book is overpriced."
positive,"This book could not be more explicit.: This book is a teacher's dream! It gives very explicit instructions and is comprehensive. One of the best parts of this book is that it essentially gives you a formula for dealing with reading problems: ""if your student has a problem with this, then do this"". Worth twice as much as I paid for it."
negative,"Not So Great: Chris O'Donnell certainly has the potential to be a great actor. He should not waste is time selling just his pretty face. The plot was non-existent and when it existed it was too transparrent.We love Renée Zellweger, her roll in Jerry Macquire was perfect. She had virtually no lines worth remembering. The best part of the film came when the Priest was speaking with O'Donnel on the lake near the Palace of Fine Arts. O'Donnell realized what love was, at least for him.One more point. Unless Renée Zellweger's character and that of her roommate were making more than $500,000 per year, they could not have afforded that appartment. I have been in that appartment, the rent was $5,500 per month and the condo was worth more than $1.5 million. You figure!"
negative,"Lovely novel; Dreadful Edition: Please see any of the positive reviews for my opinion of ""Plum Bun"" as a novel. This copy, however, is so riddled with typographical errors that they distract from enjoyment of the novel and make it nearly impossible to use in a scholarly manner. Splurge on an older edition; this one is a crime against a lovely book."
positive,"Totally Loved It: You have to read this book with an open mind and heart realizing that humanity tends to 'fight against' things that are perceived as scary. There are a lot of concepts in this book that may create fear in some. You have to feel what is being said through the heart center. Your intuitive sense knows the truth (whether the mind knows it or not). This book answered so many questions for me..questions I had had about feeling like I didn't belong, where I come from, etc. The truth of the matter is that the earth is changing in frequency and we need to choose to ascend with it, or to stay behind..this book talks about that too. Even 10+ years later the information is very relevant. Highly recommended for those who are just awakening or anyone already on the spiritual path."
negative,Instead: mix peanut butter with a little olive and sunflower oil and a little honey and a quality doggie vitamin supplement.
negative,"Not enough lasting energy.: It's ok but last only a few hours, at least with my TZ3. I'd buy the Panasonic one. I know for next time."
positive,I love Binchy's work: This was heart-rending and displayedthe same finesse at fully roundedcharacters with their issues. The priest'sdiscoveries and how he dealt with themwere particularly poignant.
negative,"Reviewing defective merchandise: No real review here, product was defective, so was replacement. Purchased elsewhere with more satistactory results.Still waiting for my refund...."
positive,"a literary masterpiece: an absolute masterpiece.....i have never read a book which was so rich in its prose, in its content and at the same time unputdownable!"
negative,"Little Value: It is understandable why his other books, according to his own admission, were not well received.Mr. Keel offers some rather off the wall explanations with little or nothing in the way of proof except HIS word. For those unfamiliar with this subject, controversial as it is, the book may have some interest even if of very little value.Mr. Keel dismisses, with a wave of his hand, everything written by valid and serious investigations. Admittedly there are those who have written who do not deserve to be taken seriously and Mr. Keel is at the top of that list.Desmond"
negative,A Definite Miss: Attention teachers of expository writing:Kingsley can well be used as the quintessential example of an author who disrespects his readers.
positive,"Give this to your daughters and nieces: I wish I had read this book 20, no 30, years ago -- but it was not written then. This book is proof that feminism has come a long long way. The book emphasizes self esteem while recognizing the very practical realities of ""the dance"" in a relationship with a man. Old fashioned in powerfully modern way. Pragmatic information which has application in all aspects of female self-identity and personal strength. I highly recommend this book for any girl or woman who is thinking of getting involved in a relationship. Excellent excellent book."
positive,"A brilliant rethinking of an historical misconception: It doesn't matter if you love mysteries or hate them, you simply must read The Daughter of Time. This is a brilliantly written novel calling into question the legend of Richard III of England as fabricated by his enemies - a hunchback, a killer of innocents and an incarnation of evil. Thoroughly researched and impeccably written, it provides not only a refresher course in English history, but in how all history is created."
negative,Intriguing idea but I felt it lacked real depth: A fast and light read but didn't have the depth I like to find in a story. It was an interesting plot on the surface and there was enough to it that I did finish it but I won't read it again. Once was more than enough for me. It is a good clean book and if you have nothing else to read it will do but if you have other selections I would try those first.
positive,"I'm the author: I am the author of this book. It is no longer being printed. I gave it only four stars because its 2009 successor is deserving of five stars.Go to the following Amazon.com page to see West Side Publishing's ""Armchair Reader: The Last Survivors of Historical Events, Movies, Disasters, and More""Armchair Reader: The Last Survivors of Historical Events, Movies, Disasters, and MoreRobert Ernest Hubbard"
negative,"Keep Running: The story was good up until the end. The family was running for no reason at all when you come to the end. I do not believe this would have happened in real life. For a lawyer, that is not very smart and for a wife to go along with this with her children that is dumb."
positive,"They are ok! Better than cruisers: My favorite diapers were the sensitive skin swaddler diapers, these were my next favorite and I think that overall they were better than the cruisers. For some reason there would be the crystals that appeared after my daughter would urinate and I honestly didn't like this. So if you don't like the swaddlers you should give these a try."
positive,"Mr Sun Falls In Love: Mr Sun is a great character, you find yourself wanting to know more with each page that you get so involved in him you can't stop reading. The story is well told through each of the characters' points of view, and the ending reveals a great twist. It has a lot of elements from mystery to romance, you can't wait for the author to write more. I look forward to reading many tales of Mr Sun."
negative,"Too cluttered: As a beginnng Spanish student, I find the book cluttered and overwhelming. Also, a more organized approach to the subject would help. My foreign language background is French, so I am familiar with how to study a different language."
negative,half moon: Never have I been this dissatisfied with a Columbia product. This item has an uncomfortable fit. TERRIBLE. It's the last thing I'll buy from this brand.
negative,"Ehh Cough Bleh Uhh Snn Ugh NO!: A great story to only be completely barried by unwatchable action. Climax action scene? No just fighting the robots which were boring to watch after a few seconds. Great cast, great plot, great title sorta. Just the action was not interesting making this movie the worst summer movie I have seen in a long time."
positive,"Great CD: If you love Dierks you will love this CD. Great new songs, even the ones that are not on the radio."
positive,"Hilarious, warm and exactly the way it was: I grew up in Sweden in the 70's, and can attest to this film being *very* realistic. Well, most of us grew up in regular family households rather than communes like this one - yet the tone, dialogue, props, setting, mood, and plot - all hit the mark exactly. Moodysson is a genius to be able to tell a whole generation's painful rite of passage with such a sense of hilarity and warmth."
positive,"In my humble opinion...: ...they chose the WRONG Smiths song to cover. Everybody and their grandma covers ""How Soon is Now?"" It's become the ""Stairway to Heaven"" of its generation. What they SHOULD have covered was ""Sheila Take a Bow,"" a sweet li'l ol' courtship song for androgynes of uncertain sexual persuasion. For a bonus, Yulia Volkova (The Noisy One) could cover ""Bigmouth Strikes Again!"" ;-)It's a shame the act is self-destructing. Under better management, and more jovial songs to balance out the ""I'd DIE without you!"" theme off the album, they could have been a cooler version of the Village People. They'd have been the toast of the club circuit! Unfortunately, their manager was an eejit.Now if I was managing that act, I'd have them do a disco-opera about Original Gangsta Lesbian Poetess Sappho! (Bulb lights up! Me Am Hulk starts writing the libretto...)"
negative,Antiquated: The wording was a bit too antique for my liking. The storyline was good but I was disappointed in this book.
negative,"IT HAS NOT STOOD THE TEST OF TIME: Director Darryl F. Zanuck tried his best with the technical resources at his dispostition at the time and using the narrative standar for epic movies of that time. But watching this movie today is a really act of courage. It drags and drags, the three hours seem to never end. Also, even if they tried to give a view of the global situation, they failed miserably.The movie is an endless sequence of shell and fire sounds, a really pain. I simply don't like the movie, although I understand what they tried to do."
positive,"Brilliantly Entertaining!: If you're into incredible special effects...if you enjoy witty 1-liners to break up a serious mood...if you like a good thriller...then you're reading about the right movie! In many ways, the original Karloff thriller shines through this re-make, but 1999 has a LOT more to offer the audience in ways the original never dreamed of!The Mummy is entertaining, exciting, and on DVD, it just about captures the entire movie-going experience! I URGE you to pick up a copy of your own (or at least rent it a few times)!"
positive,"great expectations!: I am a teacher and tried last year to read and teach this novel but used the original. (6th graders) This copy is the novel but an adapted version. The print size, the text appearance are friendly. The authenticity and truth of the story are upheld. All my expectations have been met. There are questions at the end of the text. Wanted about 20 copies but did not want to pay the top price! Like usual Amazon came to the rescue. Can't wait to introduce the children to a classic but closer to their level. It is authentic to so many of the important quotes. Not too many authors have one of their novel's characters last the test of time, meaning Scrooge. Dickens created him and we know the symbolic Scrooge, one hundred years later...we need to acknowledge his greatness as a writer."
positive,"Who is the real Cosmic Christ?: This is a great book that the world needs to read. For too long the message of the Gospel has been used to hurt Mother Earth. This cant go on, there is no doubt. But Matthew Fox is not the first or only person to make reference of the term Cosmic Christ. Elizabeth Clare Prophet refers to him in her books, and associates him with Maitreya, the prophesied return of Buddha. If I'm not mistaken, Sai Baba also identifies himself in some fashion with the cosmic christ. These are both people with their heads in the clouds, hardly ""grounded"". What is Matthew Fox's view of their cosmic christ? Is it the real thing or is it counterfeit? I want to know."
positive,great alto recorder for my 10 year old: My ten year old fell in love with the recorder so as an incentive to continue doing well - my 14 year old promised to buy him a nicer recorder. This alto recorder is wonderful and he loves it.
negative,"Not Moorcock's Best: Blood is a book that seems to have too many interesting ideas. Sadly it never focuses on any one of them long enough to become interesting. Too many elements seem to have been tossed in without having any impact on the story, stretching suspension of disbelief beyond all bounds. The attempt at ""non-linearity"" simply creates a jumble that, while ultimately having a certain underlying logic, is not a very entertaining or engrossing read."
negative,"Rather poor: I am indeed a Saga fan, but this album is very poor. I could only find 2 songs I liked (""That's how we like it"" and ""We'll meet again""). The rest of the songs simply show extremely poor composition and a severe lack of inovation, which is what progressive rock is supposed to be all about.There simply is no substitute for ""Worlds Apart"" and ""Heads or Tails"" as far as Saga goes."
negative,"Don't buy this!: Product information is confusing and have so bad luck i received the Bootleged version. Still i'm keeping it because i'm not very picky with cosplay, but for hardcore cosplayers stay away, looks really cheap and fake! :("
positive,Bunyan's Allegory: This book was very fun to read and very spiritually uplifting. I enjoyed it from beginning to end! It was an excellent choice.
negative,Something Wicked This Way Comes= Waste of reading time: This book was a waste of my time. He uses to many pages describing... NOTHING. I guess he tried to make it creepy by the whole evil carnival but... it didnt work. I had to do this book for a book report so I had to read it. Halfway through the book it seems as if you are just beginning it waiting for the story to really begin. I reccomend for you to NOT read this book. The only thing that drew my attention was the cover.
negative,"Big Band Hits: I really know nothing about this era of music, but I bought it for my 94 yr. old Mother-in-law and she is not impressed. However, she is picky, so her opinion may not count."
negative,"Not impressed: I have tried similar products in the past, but wasn't very satisfied. After reading the excellent reviews for this one, i gave it a try. I am disappointed. Even though it comes in precut shapes and is cold wax, it did not do a very good job on my eybrows. It left a lot of hairs. The shape of the precut wax strips isn't very good neither - it didn't match my eybrows very well. My conclusion so far from my experience with at home wax products is that nothing does as good of a job as you get in a salon."
negative,"I've Read This book before under another name: I've read this book before, under another title, ""The Lord of the Rings"" ! This book is essentially LOTR with the names changed! I made a list of comparisons and differences and the similarities far outnumber the differences. The family of Tolkien should look into this! Not to mention how slow going this book is! every other page the characters have to stop and rest and sleep and eat, then fight then do the same thing all over again! Oh yes, let's not forget the Star Wars references in there too! Read the LOTR if you want the original story!"
positive,"Excellect Value and Fast Service: When I am in need of a product I spend a lot of time doing research. Not only are the costs of the product and shipping/handling charges important but also the speed, accuracy and dependability of the company/person involved. I highly recommend this source to be checked out when searching for specific products."
negative,"""Say It Isn't So, Joe?"": Two words: not funny.While the task was daunting -- if not impossible, the studio tried to follow-up the incredible success of AIRPLANE! ... but, instead, they ran out of air after the opening credits. Largely unfunny, the same cast from AIRPLANE! is brought back together to face the monumental task of delivering the same jokes. Don't waste your time, your money, or any brain cells on this horrible stinker."
negative,"Ripped off from a video game: No need to read it, I just saw five minutes of the movie, and it's a total rip-off. Let me explain why; first it starts with an egg, which is probably a good start. However, and this is a big one, if you watch it after that, it clearly states as a rip-off. Has anybody ever played ""Legend of Dragoon"" on Playstation, if you have, then you know what I'm talking about. But if you haven't then let me be brief. Boy finds stone, stone becomes a sourse of power to from a dragon, boy then saves a girl who has a stone of her own that a king wants, and finally boy discovers that his own father is his enemy. You get the picture. Whoever this guy is, should be sued BIG time."
negative,"Thanks for Robbing Me of my Money: I would just like to thank the Sinclair Institute for robbing me and the other 4 million people who bought their videos of our money.I cannot believe that someone would produce something that is this terrible.Let me save you some money. This video reveals no ""SECRETS"" to sex and no ""AMAZING"" positions. The Doctors that give the advice provide a lot of Medical Mumbo Jumbo.Let me save you some money. The video has bad actors filmed in a terrible setting. It looks like a bad 70s adult flick. Yes a 70s film. Nothing from this millennium that's for sure.As for an overall synopsis: Pay attention to your lover and try to satisfy them. Try different places and positions for sex. And oh yes, men and women love oral sex. Come on Sinclair, everyone knows that.Thanks but no thanks..."
negative,"Totat waste of time: I should of started at chapter 31. Chapters 1-30 was so boring. I skipped over a lot of the info. How many times can you describe a moutain, a cave, and how to make tea and fire. The only thing Ayla needs now is a red cape and we can start calling her SUPER AYLA.........."
positive,A beautiful book!: I was more than pleased when I received this book. The octagonal format was perfectly suited. I was sorry to read the one negative review which only reflected that reviewer's moral judgment. These were souvenirs purchased by SAILORS! Why was she surprised?
positive,"Uranium: Good for nuclear weaponry, bad for attempts at superhero creation: I bought this Uranium a couple of days ago, and it just came in the mail this morning. I went to the bathroom to try it out, and it turns out ""apply directly to the affected area"" is poor advice, as I was convinced it operated similar to Icy-Hot patches. Well, I don't get muscle cramps anymore, but I've started communicating with the household insects and apparently I'm the Avatar of their ancestral guardian spirit Tok'rahl Naktir. I would have given this a five-star, but the superhuman strength and speed turned out to be a product of brain cancer. Who woulda thought, am I right guys?"
positive,"The Dark Expression of an Angel: After the ""defectuous"" PG second album, he returns with this excellent piece, wich has less 'sugar' than its two predecesors. Gabriel leaves behind common facts of life (treated sometimes abstractly, as usual), to talk about mental conficts (paranoia, and amnesia, just for mentioning a couple), and politic dimmension. The music is a mixture of new-wave-punk, and the beginning to the experiment with ethnic rythms, which was formally introduced in 'Security'. But also, the music of ""PG3"" is as dark as the cover of the album. PG3 begins to show the extravagant personality that Gabriel hides behind his ""Angel Face""."
positive,"Great Picture, Great sound: Before I bought this TV, I went to the consumer reports web site. This TV is listed as a best buy (for 32"" TVs) so I bought it. The picture is great, as is the sound. This TV has the high end flat screen, but is not cluttered with interesting buy relatively unuseful features like Picture in Picture (PIP loses coolness after 1 week). So what you get is a great TV for a great price."
positive,good.: the book arrived earlier than i thought and in pretty good condition. only thing was the side of the book was ripped but other than that i can not complain.
negative,"Not authentic: The title of this video mentions Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, what is being taught on this tape is not authentic Argentine Tango. Not even close. It's ballroom tango. There is a huge difference: in music, style, steps, posture, etc... Don't be fooled by ballroom instructors trying to teach Argentine Tango. The only authentic instruction available on the market comes from authentic Argentine instructors from Buenos Aires."
negative,"paper feeding problem.. solved..: Update: 5/8/07I finally contacted HP about the paper feeding problem. I chat with the HP associate online, and it was a plesant chat. He was really nice. After some troubleshooting and the problem still hadn't been solved, he agreed to send a cleaning kit to me for free (as it was covered by the warrenty). The cleaning kit came and it worked. I've been using the printer for a couple of months after the cleaning, and it's working with no problems. So if you encounter the same problem, try contacting HP.Just like other users have commented, this printer doesn't automatically get the paper, so you have to stay ready by the printer to feed each page. It gets very annoying. The reason I gave it a 2 star is because of it's quality of the printouts. Also, the ink is fairly priced."
negative,"Chainsaw POP Phenomena!: I truly think this movie is way overated. The gore was weak the movie was just plain dramatic. If you want true gore watch bad taste, pieces that is gore.I was truly unimpressed by this boring movie it is far beyond scary or good. Good would be an understament."
positive,"Without question, the best Ant book so far: ...and perhaps ever. I can't imagine it getting much better than this.There are some weaknesses in the book, for instance, they refrain from printing a lot of build files and talk about ""evolving"" some mysterious file you don't get to see until chapter 8. But it's not a fatal error.I bought the other two books that mention Ant, and would strongly recommend AGAINST getting Ant: The Definitive Guide. I can't believe there are people that recommended that over this."
positive,"The first honest book I've ever found: I've struggled with weight and incomplete exercise knowldge my whole life, so I was very skeptical when it came to yet another workout book. I was so tired of books promising excellent results in 6 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 weeks, 8 hours it seemed! This book caught my eye in a bookstore and I had instant buy-in when I realized this isn't an ""instant"" book... it's going to take a long time to achieve the body I want. It's clearly written so that someone like me with no experience sculpting my body can easily follow it. I've got a lot of weight to lose, and a lot of wrong exercise knowledge to right in my head. I am fully confident that I can do this!"
positive,"An awesome Rock N' Roll album, from a great band!!: ""Be Here Now"" is for sure the best Oasis album. It has their greatest songs, and it shows how well they can make music.When I bought this CD I wasn't sure if I was going to like, but after I listened to songs like ""D'You Know What I Mean?"", ""All Around The World"", ""Stand By Me"", and the title track ""Be Here Now"", I saw that once again Oasis did a great job!!"
negative,"ugh: I didn't enjoy reading this in college and I decided that now I was older I would have a better appreciation for the work. I know I'm ""supposed"" to love the classic literature of Jane Austen. I just really don't. This is one that is better in film IMHO."
positive,Fun!: Got this and several other styles for Christmas and this one is great. It gets the answer 95% of the time. Even my little grandkids like it for the sparkly lights.
negative,"fricking heavy as hell death metal: wow this cd is so heavy and brutal , the guys from cannibal corpse and slayer had to retire. i mean the lyrics are so insane the riffs so intenseafer listening to this im afraid to listen to it again cuz its so heavy!!!pantera slayer and cannibal corpse sucsk!"
positive,"Good Product: When I received the mop, there were no instructions on the care of the microfiber pads. Other than that, the mop is very good and easy to use. I even used it on my walls for a quick spot cleaning - it did not leave any streaking on my walls. Nice product."
negative,"Not awful, but close: Ms. Laurenston can certainly write a good story, but these characters are not likable. I disliked the book primarily because the heroine is violent, selfish, and a potty mouth. The author tried to substitute money for class and failed. Except for being good in bed and a fashion snob (if that counts), she has no redeeming qualities. And the hero? Eh, there was soo much potential, most of it unrealized. He really didn't DO anything, everyone else did things around him that he reacted to. He didn't do the kidnapping, he never stood up to the heroine but let her walk all over him, and he couldn't even rescue himself.The action and pace were really good, if a bit random, and really good sex scenes. But that wasn't enough to make me enjoy a story about a low class witch and her doormat hero."
positive,"Afterthoughts ... Music for the soul and spirit: In this busy, crazy, and sometimes angry world of ours, it is a gift to relax and listen to Kristi's arrangements of both original and classic music. I found the album a tool for helping me to relax at the end of a hard day, or to listen too simply for the soothing harmonies and flowing tonal art. Add this CD to your collection of ""Music for your Soul and Spirit."""
positive,Woodlands Smoker: Bradley products always perform great in my smoker. The burn thoroughly and produce great smoke for the perfect taste. Everyones loves the result.
negative,"Not what I thought: I was pretty disappointed with this book. I tried to stay with it, thinking it might get better but ended up putting it down after about half way.The author focuses more on her personal, anecdotal stories then her actual time spent in the monastery living among the vowed. Absent was any insights or conversion gained by her experiences with the religious, which was more what I was looking for.Anyone wanting to understand more about the depths of faith gained from religious life should spend their time and money reading some of the saints instead."
positive,"classic!: I read this in high school and loved it. I'm reading it to my children now (the oldest is 7yrs) and they love it also. I think they would get more out of it in a year or two, but this is a must read! There is a reason it won an award!"
negative,"Horrible for beginners; no comment as a reference: I am a developer with 8 years experience but novice to Network programming. A friend suggested this book as a first and default one to start with. I am completely disappointed. It's not a practical, jump-into it, internet-age book. Let me see if it serves any purpose as a reference. BTW, the CD is totally useless. It has only a few files which you can anyway download for free."
positive,Would Recommend!: Both my 1yr old and 4yr old loved this! The only downfall is that it does take up a good chunk of space.
positive,"excellent: works really fast! If you have very sensitive teeth I would recommend using crest regular (14 days) system. It's more mild, takes longer, but gentle on the teeth.easy to use and really works!"
negative,"Hidden Rules of class at work: Don't waste you time reading this hodge-podge of ill-digested psycho-bable or waste your money buying it. It will tell you nothing of interest or usefulness and it doesn't understand the issues of class at all.And, what is worse, it is extremely poorly written."
negative,"Humbug!: This may not be the films fault, but I did not like it. Not my sort of thing, so I probably never should have bought it in the first place."
negative,What a waste of time....: This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I take that back. It definitely is the worst movie I've ever seen. The good news is that I didn't pay a cent to see it. The whole movie was comprised of really bad acting. Rob Lowe must be hurting for money. The plot was beyond ridiculous. I feel sorry for anyone who was in this movie or had anything to do with it. It really stunk up the place.
negative,"a dissapointing read: I bought this book before I knew it was written by a 15 year old. The story is a sorry hodge- podge of the favourite fantasy authors, but without the in- depth character creation or story , that one would expect. I'm sorry to say that mid-way I had started skipping pages ,to get through faster. Anyway it was not all bad, the beginning at least had promise, even if it didn't follow through. I will not be buying the sequel, but hopefully with time,maybe a decade or so, and a good editor, Paolini would be writer to watch for."
negative,"It only remembers the time, not the station.: Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a ..clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you"
positive,"pinochio: I loved the movie all over again, I will have my 8 yr old nephew and 5 yr old, and all the other abot 9 yrs that want to watch it.It is lovely, on my recent vacation/retreat I drew pinochio onto a full page (from a little 2-3 inch from Disneyworld)., and now I have my own ""self made poster to enjoy"".The product came very shortly after I had ordered it.Thanks,G. Novack"
negative,AUDIOVOX 1680 PORTABLE DVD PLAYER: i RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT TO USE FOR AIRLINE TRAVEL AND FOR USE IN MY mOTORHOME.i PLAYED DVD'S AND CD'S AND FOUND BEAUTIFUL SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY.hOWEVER AFTER ONLY 3 USES THE UNIT COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING.dISCS WOULD SPIN INTERMITTENLY AND NOT LOAD.i LOVED THIS PLAYER WHEN IT WORKED BUT I'M AFRAID TO TRY IT AGAIN.tHE PLAYER HEATS UP WITH EXTENDED PLAY WHICH MANUFACTURER SAYS IS NORMAL BUT IT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE BREAKDDOWN.
negative,"moonstruck: This title, Moonstruck (BlueRay) is not widescreen , as advertised, nor are there any special features. Amazon's return policy is quite cumbersome, so I didn't bother to return it assuming a replacement would be the same. Things such as this are becoming more common with Amazon as is my dissatisfaction. They could easily lose this customer who makes about 100 purchases a year."
positive,"reliable and great value: These diapers never fail us. From birth to toddlerhood these Pampers have proven to work great with our squirmy guy. Getting the larger economy box is a great value and I love using S&S so I don't have to think about running to the store. I know that at some time or another, a diaper will leak or poop'splosian will occur... but in 14 months I think we've had two or three. These are just reliable, day after day!"
positive,One of the best: I think this system is awesome! i got it for x-mas and so far so good those people who can get it to read cds are just dumb and can't figure anything out! seriously though if you buy this you can make playlists and everythign out of mp3 cds just as long as they are finalized and everything is awesome from there on! wow! i love it! its almost mesmorizing to play with! totally worth buying!
negative,"weird & funky: i have one of the originals of this book and it's so old and crusty and it was so weird and hard to understand with all those big words, and different from the new copies made of it. The only reason to read it would be for school."
positive,"The best book for learning the Pagemaker program.: This book is easy to follow, easy to find answers and takes you from beginning to end in a painless fashion. It allows you to learn as much or as little as you want without wasting your time."
positive,"Jared Taylor has let the cat out of the bag!!!: This is no ""Rush Limbaugh"" talking here. This is an objective look at the unforeseen consequences of the liberal idealism of trying to mandate equality among races. Mr Jared Taylor shows that when you attempt to favor one group of people over the other you do nothing more than create another type of racism and inequalty. And trying to create the same playing field is almost impossible after Affirmative Action has put in place."
negative,"DVD Quality: The movies are just fine, but the quality of the DVD is horrible. The soundtrack is such that it requires the volume on the TV to be turned up over twice as much as any other DVD requires. It's like watching the movies with earplugs in."
negative,"Julie and Julia: 365 days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment: What a disapointment. I thought it would be a fun read, someone working through a life crisis by cooking their way through Mastering the Art of French Cooking Volume 1, but I threw the book in the trash after reading the first few chapters and thumbing through the rest. The profanity, baseness and the f-bombs are inappropriate and don't add anything to the content."
negative,"Sadly, this is one of those times where the movie is better than the book.: The author writes with an omnipresent/fairy tale voice that sometimes works in short stories, but becomes grating in novels. The characters are bizarre, not charming, with the aunts being creepy hags, Gillian a self-centered jerk, and Sally a sad sack who raises two brats. Worst of all? No real magic is presented (at least in the parts I manged to read).I got through 28% of the book on my Kindle before I got tired of waiting for the plot to show up"
negative,"Its fun but...: Its pretty fun. I love dogs and I got this game because I didn't have a real one. But then the day came, I GOT A REAL PUPPY. After that I didn't play it hardly at all because #1 It got boring (All games do)#2 Why would I play it?! I have a real dog!If you have a real dog don't bother taking care of and loving a fake one. Spend time with you REAL dog.But if you don't have a dog this is a good game because it is pretty realistic."
positive,"Simply the Best!: My brother and I count Roger Rabbit as one of the best movies ever made. We used to have all-day Roger Rabbit festivals, where we would watch the movie over and over again. The movie is THAT fun. I venture to say it is a movie for all ages. Adults will find subtle humor that will go over kids heads, and kids will love the animation and slap-stick jokes. This is one of the most visually amazing movies ever made, and you forget that most of the characters are cartoons. This is a movie where the toons truly come to life."
negative,"bland, disappointing: Not a bad book, but I was disappointed. Instead of interesting ideas and unusual approaches, Best makes a whole sequence of fairly obvious points that most people would come up with on their own. Better books on the same general topic are by A.K. Dewdney, John Alan Paulos, and Cynthia Crossen."
negative,"WARNING: This is the worst book ever written: As most people readers know, Jack Higgins has written many fine action-packed books. However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review."
negative,"Totally Tasteless!!: Do not waste your time on this loser about an irresponsible woman who has kid after kid & then wonders why she is poor! The only thing you can say is ""Please--somebody get her to a birth control clinic fast before she has another one!"""
positive,"The Last Juror: A fantastic read! Grisham deviates from the ""greedy lawyer"" genre he helped to popularize (tho the book contains several characters who are attorneys), and he does what he does best- storytelling of the people in the deep South. Woven into the main plot- a murder and trial- is a fully fleshed corps of characters, some likeable and others not, and as the book proceeds, I found myself truly interested in most of them and the outcome of the plot. This is by far his best written novel."
negative,"Different actors + Director= Horrible: Shouldn't even have ""Henry"" in the title. Whereas the first was original, shocking and brilliant, the sequel is merely a joke. I had a feeling it would not be any good before I rented it, but just had to see it being such a fan of the original. Don't waste your time because it is simply a bore. Watch the original again! I'm serious.In relation to this film: ""It is not always differnt and not always the same."""
negative,king rat: the book is ok but I am very dissapointed in the condition of the book as I am reading it it is falling apart from the binding and it was listed as good condition but in my opion it was in poor condition water stains yellowing pages and binding is falling apart for the price I paid I expected better quality I doubt that I will purchase thru this group ever again Sharyl
positive,smelly pens: My kids love these pens. They last and last.I had a set from the late 1970's and I could still color with them.This was our 2nd set for the kids and deffinately will purchase again.
positive,"A pefect battle of religion, alcohol, and poetry.: Published only a year after his masterpiece On The Road, Dharma Bums is a visionary look at the debilitating effects of fame and alcohol. It follows Ray Smith (Jack) and Jahy Rider (Gary Snyder) on a buddhist romp through the mountains of the west coast. Contemplating their religions and beliefs and coming to beautiful realisations about the world (""You can't fall off a mountain""), they create the rucksack revolution. A beautiful insight into thought and poetry. A must for anyone who wants to learn to think or expand their mind."
negative,"Too little information to be of significant value: ""Wilderness Survival"" is well written and an excellent book to motivate you to study further (and the author encourages this frequently), but as an instruction manual it is severely limited. Though you can't expect in-depth coverage of many different topics in a book so small, the author fails to cover any single topic adequately. She does provide a list of emergency equipment that would likely be helpful to those unaccustomed to wilderness environments, but overall the book doesn't provide sufficient information to justify its purchase."
negative,"This movie insulted my intelligence...: along with the new Starwars. It is one of those movies that you want your 8 bucks and 2 hours of your life back afterwards. The plot is lame. The psycho-thriller classic turns a flop & dumb special effects-fest. I recommend ""the Matrix"" ""Taxi Driver (remastered)"" etc. for your holiday viewing."
negative,"Below average historical romance: As a reader of historical romance, a civil war buff, and a fan of the Outlander series author Diana Gabaldon, who once recommended this book on her web site, I came to this novel fully expecting to like it. I was severely disappointed. This is a middling, at best, romance novel with a pedestrian plot, predictable characters, and a hero and heroine who couldn't be more representative of all that's tedious in the genre. The author seems sincere and there's a sense that she did her civil war era research, but the book holds no surprises and little inducement for the reader to continue past the first few chapters.If you're going to write a novel about another spirited, plain but beautiful, impoverished girl-woman who makes a marriage of convenience with a gorgeous, tortured, secretly-sensitive man who-pretends-to-hate-but-really-loves-her than it better be exquisitely plotted and beautifully written. This book is neither."
positive,"WRONGLY CLASSIFIED: The genre should have been comedy. This movie was neither scary, nor mysterious or thrilling.The scariest part to me was probably when Liam Neeson got the class stuck in his hand and had to pull it out. I found myself wondering why good actors such as this would actually agree to take part in this sorry excuse for a horror film.The movie has next to no plot, none of the stuff that happened was explained, and the stuff that was supposed to be scary wasn't. Oh My God it's a statue...let me scream in fear and trip over myself while I'm trying to run away!Skip this tripe."
negative,"No Longer The Same Show: Season 4 brought about huge cast, plot, and setting changes.[Setting Changes]Old Setting: Aggrestic, CA near LA (Fictional affluent suburb)New Setting: Ren Mar near San Diego/Tijauna (Fictional run down beach town)[Cast Changes]Heylia James, Conrad Shepard, and their associates are no longer in the show. Guillermo, Esteban and other Latino drug dealers are now the main counterpart to the Botwin Family and Friends.In short Latino drug dealers replaced the African American drug dealer characters.[Plot Changes]Much darker, less creative, less humor, more violence, and much more severe moral issues. Human trafficking, gun running, harder drugs, addiction, sex with minors, etc.[In Summary]The writers ran out of creative energy so turned to smut to fill the hole. Episodes 1-6 were really boring and hard to get through. Hopefully Season 5 will see a return to the original formula."
positive,"A fresh account of a young man's journey to Taos in 1847: This newsy contemporary recounting of a trip that includes being a guest in Cheyenne lodges, freezing on the Texas plains, witnessing the trials of the murderers of New Mexico Governor Charles Bent, and wonderful conversations with mountain men and French Canadian voyageurs is written by a boy with an enthusiasm for his experience and a good eye and ear. Lots about horses, mules, food and dancing. A lovely book and fine language."
negative,"The joke's on me, I watched this crap! Coming from a diehard TF fan!: I can't believe Hasbro alowed Micheal Bay to butcher this franchise on the big screen! Okay the first one was okay, the second one was pure imature garbage, and Dark of the Moon was meh.... I will say though there are some G1 nods, but not enough, for crying out loud they did a horrible job on Soundwave, and Shockwave, and why did they make Bumblebee such a crazy warrior, for goodness sakes in the G1 series he was a Recon Transformer, not a fighter, because he would always get he's butt kicked! And Starscream getting killed by Sam, really Bay? And of course the human are flat out stupid, crude, cartoonie, and just add to stupidity of the trilogy! And Megatron is crap in this, they make him look like a sad lost puppy in ROTF, and DOTM, and Alpha Trion (excuse me SENTINEL PRIME) was never on the Ark! And Alpha Trion was never a Prime! They should rename this trilogy, BayFormers!"
positive,Titanium Death Stick hammer: I purchased this hammer for my son who is a carpenter by trade.He said it is the best hammer he has ever owned.He loves the light weight and the curved handle.Every one that has tried out his hammer says they would love to have one like it.He also says he would never want to go back to a steel headed hammer agin.Also says the next hammer he buys will be a Death Stick.
positive,Great buy: Great buy. The book came as described and in a timely fashion. I will order from them again.
positive,"This is a wonderful novel for everyone of all ages!: After reading SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER, I would definetely recommend it to young adults and adults alike!"
negative,The Original But Not their Best: Bon Jovi's self titled debut album contains nine tracks which are all right but with the exception of Runaway do not reach the musical heights of their later albums. You would purchase this album more for historical value if your fan of the greatest rock band of the 80's rather than for the actual songs on here. This album is where it all began and the tracks are not as substantial guitar wise or lyrically as the boys will achieve on their later masterpieces. Unless you are a huge Bon Jovi fan you probably will not want this album. Bon Jovi have created some of the greatest albums ever made and New Jersey and Slippery When Wet would be my recommendations if you do not own any of their albums at all and are looking to start.
negative,"Rent it... don't buy it: Teens will enjoy this film, especially those aged 13-17. Although the two main characters look a bit old for the type of humor they employ, the film features a few excellent taglines and, in general, is quite refreshing.But beware, this is not your usual comedy and if you are looking for a masterpiece, you will be disappointed. I would not recommend you purchase this for your library as it is unlikely you will want to watch it for the second time. On the other hand, if you have a free evening and need some relaxation, which doesn't require you to think too much, this movie might be what you are looking for."
negative,"Disgusting: Kettle corn should have a subtle sugar crunch. This did not. It tasted chemically bitter. I usually read labels, but did not think about it when buying this product. I would never have purchased anything with sucralose. I threw it out."
negative,"bad: Used pampers cruisers,just loved them, for over 2 yrs.....then they just stopped making those and started baby dry. I hate these. Leak all the time. I dont understand pampers,why fix whats not broken??Now have ordered huggies,hope they are better.neeta.doc.nita@gmail.com"
negative,"Gee, I read this 6 mos. ago in ""Stop Getting Dumped!"": When I read this book I kept getting this deja-vu feeling like I'd read the book before - turns out I had. The whole dreamgirl idea was done much better (and seven or eight months earlier) by Lisa Daily in ""Stop Getting Dumped!"" which in my opinion is a much better read. The empowerment aspect of this book is good, and there are some humorous parts, but it just seemed to me like a less funny, far less interesting version of ""Stop Getting Dumped!"" which I totally loved. ""Why men love"", I'm not so crazy about. If you're a relationship book junkie, this is a reasonable pick to fill out your collection. If you're only buying one dating book this year, I wouldn't make it this one."
negative,"nothing but eye candy: Here's the way I see it: all movies get at least one star, because that's the lowest rating. Gladiator gets two stars: one for existing, and the other for being nice to look at. The cinematography is excellent, the CGI effects are amazing, and the action is good. The problem is, Gladiator is nothing but a loosely strung together series of money shots. The plot and dialogue fail to hold interest for more than a few minutes at a time. You can sleep through all but ten scenes or so, and you won't be missing anything."
negative,"Experience notes are missing to be practical: Apart from the first few pages I lost the author as observations based on experience was put to an end. The remaining chapters are based on mechanics of Spells. Conclusions drawn from observations is far greater in value than mechanics with no real experience notes as to what worked or what failed or how should the performer be feeling when all is going right and when it is out of sync. See works of Joseph C. Lisiewski, Ph.D. on Time and Flow and practicality to a reader in day to day work processing. This work Moon Spells misses this value to end user who wants to Do, Observe, Correct and again Do, Observe, Correct processes in his or her efforts to make a better quality of life."
positive,a bronx tale: the best thing about this movie is seeing the everyday life in the bronx the way it was then it paints a perfect picture and thats what the director - deniro is responsible for.
positive,"Really good diapers!!!: I've used pampers with both my boys and they're wonderful, no leaks, last thru the night and they love the disigns."
negative,"Barbie's Boring Ice Show: I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done, so I thought that this would be too. It was an absolute waste of money. The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic. There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level. I can't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game."
positive,"So Cute!!: I love this chain, it's not to big but def not small either, it's just Enough...Really Cute"
negative,"Author has no creditability: I have read ""In My Soul I Am Free"" that the author, Brad Steiger, wrote on the life of Paul Twitchell. The book on Twitchell was pure fiction and Steiger played the role of publicist. Twitchell fed Steiger fictional information that was never verified or researched by Steiger, and Steiger basically entered into a conspiracy with Twitchell to defraud the public. It would seem that Steiger writes a book every-other month or so. Once again, this author has no creditability what-so-ever with me. He has distorted the truth so much in the past that I don't see why the general public can trust anything or any subject coming from this author of fiction passing itself off as truth! There is a difference! Not everything is illusion! This is what the discerning mind is for... to discover your own Truth over the deceptions of others that would prevent you from discovering ITS value and worth."
negative,"Rickety and cheap: I thought this thing was great when I first bought it... then I used it for a few months. The stem now always lilts to one side, so that it leans against the wall of my closet, or toward the door. It also doesn't turn easily after a while. This is just one of those crap pieces that works out of the box, but wasn't built to last. Buyers beware!"
positive,"BARBRA'S FINEST!!: Funny Girl is beyond ""BEYOND""!!Streisand is utterly spectacular!!I've seen this film at least 20 times and she still drives me wild...and that voice! THAT GLORIOUS, GLORIOUS VOICE!!So much has been written about the Streisand temperment and demands through the years...Well, friends, with the talent God blessed her with she is beyond reproach...Sing on Barbra! Sing on!!"
positive,"IT'S A GOOD DAY TO BE A TROJAN!: This is terrific stuff. Southern California is a college with the first or second greatest college football tradition of all times, and this book describes how, after a long layoff, Pete Carroll has returned the Trojans to these previous heights."
negative,angry coustomer: i orded a dvd from gohasting i wanted to return it n when i called them back to have my money refuned they refuse to give it back they will lie to u n take your money i dont recommend anyone to buy anything from them.
positive,"A really good movie: This is a classic, great movie. It's one that is watchable on a repeat basis. Low key but very meaningful. The movie is in black and white but that actually seems to add to it in the same way that the H. Bogart movies 'Casablanca' and 'Sahara' effectively use that medium.The price is right. It's a keeper. Buy it and sit back and enjoy a great performance."
positive,It's all about the Holy Spirit!: This book is the amazing story of what the Holy Spirit can do if you surrender your life to Him. Just read and be encouraged. Your life will never be the same.
positive,"EXCELLENT ALBUM: EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM HAS TO DO WITH CRYING AND TEARS. SOME OF THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE SO LOVELY YOU WILL WANT TO HEAR THE SONGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. RAY'S VOICE NEVER SOUNDED BETTER. AFTER LISTENING TO THIS,IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY RAY LEFT ATLANTIC RECORDS WHERE HE RECORDED MUSIC ON A LIMITED BUDGET, AND CAME TO ABC MUSIC, WHERE THEY PROVIDED HIM WITH ORCHESTRAS, CHOIRS, AND BETTER RECORDING STUDIOS TO EXPAND HIS REPERTOIRE."
positive,"Inside the Open: Mr. Feinstein is a gifted writer and storyteller. This is the story of a golf course, the championship it hosted and the people that made it happen. Mr. Feinstein follows the story of the 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black Public Golf Course from idea to fruitition. He takes us behind the scenes and inside the ropes. It is a fascinating read."
negative,descent into stupidity: I just watched this for a second time after about a year. I gave it 2 stars because of its science fiction merits but would have given it one star otherwise. A group of women descend into a cavern and can't get back out due to multiple stupid mistakes and underground monsters. The main mistake was the way they handled their battery problem for their lanterns which had limited use becaue of low battery life. Instead of alternating use (having one latern lit in the lead and the others following the first person they either used glow lights or had them all on. Many other flaws and mistakes led to their demise leaving me unsympathetic to their plight. In addition the ending was confusing. Interesting to watch regardless.
positive,"Great As Auxiliary Power Source/Input for Older Receivers: I have a 20 year old Kenwood receiver that only has inputs for two pairs of speakers. However, I wanted to hook up not only one pair of indoor speakers and one pair of outdoor speakers (patio) but also a new pair of outdoor speakers for a screened-in porch. As well I wanted to be able to use a single hook up to play my iPod on all sets of speakers. So I saw that this unit had not only an ability to power additional speakers but also an ability to do so in such a way that I could use this unit as an input to the Kenwood receiver. I simply wired the new speakers to the new AudioSource AMP-100 and used a basic RCA cable to connect the output line of the AMP to the Phono input of the receiver and presto it all works like a charm. This works exactly as I expected and I love having this product."
negative,"A total waste of time...: Not only is this book horribly written, but it is hard to follow. The author skips around, while changing the original premise of the book, so you are often at a loss about what is going on. It's as if she's trying to tell the ""real"" story of what happened in the original book. She throws in various hints at sadism and lesbianism, and I wonder if this was just to create a buzz about a book she herself knew wouldn't make much sense. The characters come off as disgusting, even making Jane a jello-headed twit. Adele is compared to Rochesters insane wife, and you will find it hard to find one sympathetic character. I wasn't expecting much from this book, but it was much much worse than I would have thought. Don't waste your time."
positive,"Wonderful Classic Film: This is the definintive Romeo and Juliet film ever! I especially enjoy the theme and film score. The location of the production, with superb performances and costumes, have made for a wonderful classic film. The transfer to DVD is excellent despite the absence of 5.1 surround. Buy it now."
positive,"KEVIN SORBO: This is a good movie. Made with low budget and yet great locations, the story just flows easily. We've seen movies like this before, and still it's a pleasure to watch the talented and handsome and strong actor Kevin Sorbo as a military leader searching for a scary soldier...Indeed, a fun movie!"
negative,"The reviews are more interesting than the book: I must say that several of the reviewers that gave this book fours and fives showed a livelier imagination and greater writing ability than did the people that contributed to this book. If you've been reading the reviews, and counted the stars, the ones have it. There's little to add that hasn't been said already. I simply wanted to add my two cents in the hope that I might save one person eight hundred or so cents.This book is not an enjoyable read. Say what you will about the aims Eric had for this book... I buy books to read for enjoyment. This one I finished only because I spent money on it and I hate throwing away a book without reading it once. It was a relief to hit the last page."
negative,"Inadequate: The cutesy little jokes and wisecracks can't hide the fact that there are many errors in the tests and in the review sections. It's obvious on many test sections that the answer is for a different question. Plus, the questions are way too easy--like training with matchsticks when you're going to have to move tree trunks."
negative,"parent of 1 year old and 3 three year old: I was so excited for my 1 year old to practice walking with this toy, thinking that she would be so encouraged by the constant funky music. My 3 year old was ""helping"" me put it together for her. The problem was that the music only played when the nose button was pushed and not at any other time as it's supposed to do! The kids got bored with it within minutes. Unfortunately, once it's assembled, it can't be taken apart for return purposes so I lost my money. I would purchase another walker instead if I were you ( one that's returnable)."
negative,"It pains me to say this...: As much as I love Jane Austen, Emma is a horrible read. This was the only one of Austen's books I couldn't finish in college. I thought I'd try it again a decade later and I still don't like it (although this time I did finish reading it).Like some of the other reviewers have stated, Emma is just not a likeable character. And unlike most of Austen's heroines, she seems to have no redeeming qualities, making it incredibly hard to read about her for hundreds of pages.I guess one could argue that the book is well written by virtue of the fact that I despise Emma so much as a character. But I'm not arguing Austen's merits as a writer. I am simply stating that this book is not worth reading when there are so many other classics out there that you might actually enjoy!"
positive,"A Thriller: Before I even started to read this book, I was on the edge of my seat! Finally, I went to Borders and got this fabled book!It started out a little boring, but so does every movie, right? Well, it turns out that, it is a little bit of every kind of book, apart from romance. In the beginning and all the way through the book, it had mystery, and a ton of adventure! One evening, i was reading it in bed, and next time I looked at the clock, it said 1:43 AM! I can't wait to get my paws on Eldest!"
positive,"Oui: This is my second endeavor into the famed distopia trilogy. Unfortunately, I should have read this one first. I loved Brave New World, but I think this is in a class by itself. I read somewhere that Brave New World was written without knowledge of this book, which would make the similarities uncanny. Anyway, This story grabbed me from the very beginning with the effective use of numbers to substitute characters names. This let's you know right off the bat that this future society is not joking around. The intertwining fashion used between dreams and reality was especially appealing, giving this novel a surrealistic feel. The thing that hooks this novel into masterpiece status is the ending. Unlike Brave New World, this was one I was not expecting. Also, the fact that a man living in communist Russia wrote this novel really enhances the experience and shows you the nightmarish visions this man derived from his way of life. Platinum."
negative,"A big design defect: My son has been using Pamper Cruiser and never had problem. So I think Baby-dry may be the same good. So I ordered some online, but am very disappointed with its design. The first time my 21-month-old wore it, it left a red mark in his thighs. One big design problem with it is the strip that adheres to the front side is not elastic, so it makes it impossible to auto-adjust itself, and is not suitable for an active toddler as it may cut into the skin. I have to return the product as I just can't use it on my son!"
positive,The essential Borodin: This is a 2 disc set and includes a LOT of really good music. It includes some that is not heard too often but should be.
negative,"disgrace to ""r'nb"": blue ""covered"" nexts' 1998 hit Too Close for their third single. Although it was a big hit, the song itself is garbage. Instead of the slow and sultry version that Next performed now we have 4 lads going on a night out and trying to pull the birds using karaoke. I disagree with a ""Music Fan not from UK"" when he/she states this sounds identical to the Next version. This is not even 5% of what the Next version is. Instead of sounding smooth and hitting the right notes like they are supposed to Blue sound like they are extremely bored and sing with no emotion. The female vocals are even worse than the Next version. Overall this song is TERRIBLE."
negative,"Worked once, then quit.: I would advise any potential purchasers to avoid this product. Mine worked once, and hasn't worked since. This is not a quality product."
negative,"Sucked!: There was not one song on this CD that impressed me. I expected more from Clay Aiken. His voice was drowned out by the music half the time and the lyrics did not capture my attention. In other words, there is not one track that I found myself humming or singing later.I force fed myself the whole CD just to get my monies worth. I was very dissappointed. Not worth buying. Hopefully, his next album will be more entertaining or at least bearable. I am a fan."
negative,"It's just i'ight: Interesting cast, nice whips, and some of the gadgets were hilarious, BUT Duane Martin as anything but a lady's man, or screw up I wasn't ready for all that! And JadaKiss acting OOH HELL NO! Sometimes you just have to say no. It's obviously a low budget film filled with African Americans so I say support your people! I mean it was what it was a movie!"
positive,Classic: Ive always enjoyed the movie and I finally read the book. It was a very good read and I really enjoyed the story and comparing it to the movie. As always the book was better than the movie.
positive,"Razr OEM Car Charger: This product works great and looks good too. This is my second (for my wifes), I have had mine for almost 10 months with no problems."
positive,Nice Bible for the price: Looking for cheaper bible to do a new study. Awesome bible good price. Received product promptly and on time. Thank you
negative,"missing pieces, no response from company: I needed this for a small repair job , but thought it would be useful to have around for years to come. I ended up returning it because parts were missing and the company never responded when i contacted them on their website.A note in the box requested that issues be resolved by contacting the company rather than returning the item, which I tried to follow, but when they don't respond to contact through their website, what is one to do but send the tool back?you can use this tool to repair your broken canondale road shifter bosses (on the downtube). just replace the easily broken bar with a slightly larger hole and a couple of m5 rivnuts and you're good to go. you can also easily install water bottle cages to any sheet of metal you can drill a pair of holes in."
negative,"If you're 16+ don't bother: These transformer movies are horrible. The special effects are the only good thing about these movies. The actors, especially the main actor have drab storylines, stupid dialogue, and the transformer voices are poor. Unless you're a kid, this movie is not for you."
negative,don't waste your money: I bought this fan less than a year ago and the remote failed. It is not covered by warrenty after 30 days and cost 50 dollars to replace the remote. The second remote is also only covered for 30 days. The fan can not operate without the remote. Pick some thing else!!!!
negative,Terrible movie: Totally unbelievable and bad in all respects. Really worthless. Only reason I give it two stars is because the [Vietnamese girl]is not bad to look at when they first abduct her.
positive,"Agnes Grey is magnificent: The feeling with which this book is written is absolutely superb. Knowing that in real life Anne's lover died, it's even more painful to read what Agnes says about her marriage, how happy she is. Furthermore it gives an excellent view into the victorian households where governesses were forced to live. I agree with George Moore who said that Agnes Grey was the 'best prose narrative in English literature'!"
positive,"Flyboys (Collector Edition): The movie has 8.5 calification, the special effect are very good, in this new time of best movies, this movie its the first movie about the First World War; the DVD has 8.7 calification, god presentation, the postal pictures from the movies are good, the extras from the movie are good.My final calification is 8.7, is a very good movie, the scense and the flow of the story is good.Please buy this title"
positive,Book Club read: Always a great story. Better than watching it in a movie. Had to read this book for an online book club.
positive,"Awesome Rice Cooker: I've had dozens of rice cookers over the years, I only wish I had gotten this one sooner. So nice not to have to throw away rice when it's only a few hours old. Well worth the price!"
positive,"Who knew worms could be so much fun?: This is a delightful toy and very powerful. The downside is that it is very loud, looks like a child's toy, and it is a lint/hair magnet. However I would still recommend this product. It is a great product for misdirection or concealment if you at all concerned about getting flack for having a vibrator because the average Joe isn't gonna realize what it is unless you tell them. Great for travel since I personally think that it would be less embarrassing for some airport attendant to pull this out of your bag at checkout/check in then a different style vibrator."
positive,"An excellent read: Another excellent book by David Sedaris. I couldn't put it down until I finished. Anyone who truly understands his humor could in no way be dissapointed by this book. The hilarious stories of his family give you a more personal look into his life. While the stories are amusing, at the same time you're able to see how much he truly cares for his family--despite all their visible flaws. The humor in his writing is matched by few. Definitely an enjoyable read."
positive,"Fantasy/Martial Arts Extravaganza: This movie was made to be a fantasy/martial arts movie, and it delivers as promised. I have a very extensive collection of Martial Arts movies and I can honestly say that this movie is one of my top 15 favorite movies. I gave it a 4 instead of a five because it does go a little overboard with the fantasy element, but not enough to distract you from the fighting, and believe me, there's a lot of it."
positive,the best: the best diapers ever!!!! i use them with my first baby and they are the most amazing never had any liking or rash on the kids body
positive,One of the best physics textbooks: It is well explained and written in a language that most university-level students are able to comprehend. There are plenty examples to illustrate problems and theories. Suitable for junior and senior physics or science studnets.
positive,A wondeful soundtrack definitley worth buying.: Great songs--Doo Wop(That Thing) is my favorite!! Lauryn speaks out about religion and love and the way they are supposed to be. She is the Queen of rap!!
negative,"Socialite celiac: Although this book had good information, it had to be ferreted out. It did not give enough day to day living details. I seldom go to cocktail parties, eat caviar or have business lunchs. The restaurants we patronize do not have reservations, most of the time do not have chefs.The author came across as a spoiled socialite with a 6 figure income and no children. She had a snit because the hostess did not cater to her every whim. She demonstrated rude behavior that I would not have tolerated.I would have prefered she give me good information on common occurances on living the 'real' life."
positive,"Very good movie, different from the mainstream.: This movie did document one of the most painful events in modern history of Europe. The events in the movie are very authentic.In Italy and in France, after the end of WWII, women who dated German soldiers and officers, were locked-up, bitten and many of them killed. I do agree with previous reviews, to some extent, this movie is a little bit stretched. Other than that, acting was excellent and the movie portrayed the '30s and '40s and events surrounding this time in Europe very well."
positive,"Happy to find this recording: This recording was always my favorite Christmas record when I was growing up. When I found the recording on Amazon and listened to clips of each song, tears streamed down my cheeks as warm childhood memories flooded my mind. I will cherish this recording and am so happy to have found it.One thing about it that brings a grin to my face is listening to ""A Christmas Toast."" Our record was scratched and it always skipped in that same place each time I listened to it. I now can hear the words that were always skipped!"
negative,"Ridley Scott selfishly deleted his girlfriend's scenes: You see less of Gianina Facio in this DVD than in theatre. Railly Scott selfishly deleted his girlfriend's scenes. The horribly murdered wife and son were an ever-lasting wound in the Roman general's mind. Now Facio's scenes were cut, you can hardly see the drives in Maximus' revenge."
positive,Sprouted: Most of these herbs have sprouted. I was surprised at how tiny most of the seeds are. They are difficult to only place a few in the soil at a time. (not anyone's fault) I will update when I transfer to the garden this summer. Shipping was fast and included was a direction sheet for how to grow this medicinal garden. So far So good!
positive,Excellent story: Started to read the story because of the movie. Found a world of great wonder. I am glad I took the time to read this excellent story.
negative,"LOVE the stories, HATE that the publisher destroyed the artwork: As a child, I was terrified by these stories and the accompanying illustrations. I was quite upset, upon buying this for my son, to find that the publisher had commissioned new artwork. I'm sure they thought it would make it accessible to a younger audience, and if you're an overprotective helicopter parent who doesn't want your kid to be scared, maybe they're right...but then why buy the book in the first place?I have nothing against Mr. Helquist - he's a very talented artist. But, his illustrations are far too tame for this book. I see no reason to have separated the stories from the original illustrations, and I'm spent the extra money to buy a gently used copy of the original book. It's equivalent to The Velveteen Rabbit or Peter Rabbit with new illustrations...an abomination, and NOT of the good, scary kind!"
negative,"Memorabilia ONLY: If you want to know what items like clothes, personal effects of MM, and fan magazines are worth at recent auctions this book is for you. If you want to know anything else, FORGET IT!"
positive,Something for everyone: A very educational movie with stunning effects and a great script allow this movie to be one of the best of the year. Try watching it with you children (teens and above) so that they can learn about the Roman Empire.
negative,Eeeh...: It's a good and well made beanie toy just would pay that much again for a little bear like that ...
negative,"OH MY GOD!: One sunday afternoon, I sat down to watch this movie with my girlfriend, and sat back awaiting stimulating entertainment.... HOW WRONG COULD I BE!What a complete load of utter complete inane useless rubbish this movie is...it is only funny if you are over 60 and like to sit in a cinema in a sleeping bag discussing being an old aged lesbian with nothing better to do than watch drivel with no point and a plot as predicatble as a an predicatble thing in a very predicatble place!I will not even offer this for re-sale, as I am so looking forward to destroying it in the most imaginative way possible....any ideas???"
positive,"Awesome: Clay Aiken is going places noone has been in a long, long time. What a talent! What a voice! What a role model to today's youth.... thanks Clay!"
positive,drapery rings: This is the very best price I've found on drapery rings - from E-bay to Walmart to Penney's. They're not fancy but nice & strong. I plan to order more!
negative,"Poor: If I wanted a hack job commentary on Johnathan Edwards and CS Lewis, next time I will try to find someone who is a little more insightful than Mr Piper. Format: Quote, restate, weak commentary, then another quote. People pay him to do this?"
positive,"The Best for Beginners: Guys i was introduced to the seduction community by ""The Game"" just like a lot of us were, and I have to say that hands down this is the most comprehensive, no B.S., step by step guide i've come across thus far. If your a foolish guy who believes that the way to a woman's heart is through candle lit dinners and pouring out your emotions then this book is definitely not for you, but if you want to weed through all the garbage that comes along with dating women and figure out how they think(whether they realize and admit to themselves it's how they think or not) then this is the book your looking for."
positive,"Today's Standards, Today's Schmanders: Timeless, sublime, beautiful, otherworldly. Forget most of today's derivitive, mixing hip hop, copy cat, [stuff]. This is the real thing. Hassell was there on Terry Riley's original ""In C"" recording that changed music for all time. He's the first trumpeter with a new sound since Miles. He's deep into it, micro rhythms, polyphony, microtones, electronics everything. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE HIM. And this is arguably one of the best. Those who think Eno and his ilk invented alternative music should do a little more research, and find out who the real progenitors are."
negative,"dont buy from them: They sent the wrong part, its been 21 days and not resolved. Thier 1-800 # will not let you talk to any one. I left messages and no response. I real close to file a complaint with the BBB. Dont buy.LB"
positive,so far so good...: i'm reading this book in my english class right now and i'm actually not even done... i'll admit in the beginning it was pretty slow and kind of boring but we're almost done with it now and i really like it.. i'm not too into reading or anything and it's pretty hard for me to find a book i like... i guess what i'm saying is that it's a good book and people should read it :)
positive,veggie tales: Veggie Tales: Dave and the Giant Pickleexcellent movie for children involving religious background from the bible with a musical twist. my granddaughter loved it.
positive,"Great deal: You cannot beat the deal you get on these diapers on Amazon.com! We have had a few problems with overnight leaks, but that was after 7-8 hours of sleep and a large cup of milk or two each time."
positive,"A Geat Book!: Clancy's first book is definitely one of his best. The way he depicts modern combat is as if he was actually on the front lines in a modern WWII. The only part that I disliked was all of the tedious submarine lingo. It would be great if he would have put a glossary in, but it's still awesome."
negative,"Story is great, DVD picture and sound quality are poor: Grew up with this movie, but unfortunately this particular DVD was poorly mastered. As others have mentioned, many scenes are so dark you can see nothing, the sound is poor such that you can barely understand most characters and, at least playing through my XBox, there seemed to be a compression issue because the video became pixelated very frequently.Nevertheless, it is worth getting for $10 just to have it in your collection since the art, narration and music are all super. If you have a VHS player, that might be a better way to go."
negative,"Disrespectful: I bought this book for my 3 year old and I am returning it. Froggy's mother tells him it is time to go to bed and like most children, he resists and stalls. What I don't like about the book is the way the mother lets Froggy push her around. Froggy tells his mother that SHE has to close the closet, open the door a crack, and turn the night light down before HE will go to sleep. And the mother does as she is told. He then spills water on the floor and the mother cleans it up and then continues to do as Froggy demands."
negative,"Terrible diapers: This baby dry diaper is supposed to be used for longer duration at nights. Out of the 5 diapers I have used, the gel balls from 2 of them burst and spread all over the house. I have been using the pampers swaddlers and the pampers cruisers but never had issues with them. I will never buy the pampers "" baby dry"" diapers again."
negative,"Death in Yellowstone: Accidents & Foolhardiness: This pales after you've read OVER THE EDGE: DEATH IN THE GRAND CANYON. A fact is given but not details. The author cannot just say someone died falling in the pool when they got got off the path and not fill in the facts. A person was killed by a bear. Where is the rest of the story? I put the book down & maybe I'll finish it, someday."
negative,ummm........: personally i think it's boring. but i gave it 2 stars anywayzzz. cuz some parts of it was actually pretty awesome. but i was just kinda half asleep when i was watchin' it.
negative,"Painful Screed: In this ""Classic"" defense of religion (Christianity in particular), Apologist-in-Chief C.S. Lewis offers a stunning smorgasbord of flawed premises, tortured logic, and non-stop non sequiturs. From a master wordsmith, jabberwockey."
negative,"A children's movie which could have been edited to 45 min.: My family found this movie to be long and tedious. Even my three year old daughter does not want to see it again. Overall, the dialog is monotone and the songs are more of the plot than the characters. Unfortunately these songs are all done in the same whiny tone."
negative,A bad reprint: This edition broke off in mid-sentence in the last page or two. Don't order it until the problem has been fixed.
positive,"Classic Clancy.: This is one of Clancy's first books. Therefore it belongs to a time when he was worth reading. The best part is the plausible way in which he describes how world war III would happen if it could occur without Nuclear Weapons. As usual, Clancy delivers an action packed book and is a master in telling a great story. His command of military technology is unique. The flaw lies on the caracthers. They are flat and borderline cliche. Clancy has no grasp on what makes humans, well, humans."
negative,"A good read if you are in the mood to throw up: I read this book for English, and I was looking forward to it. I am obsessed with Survivor, so I thought it would be fun. WRONG!!! It is incredibly boring and disgusting. I was very much disturbed when I found young children killing each other. I think that anyone with a conscience would agree with me. Please, only read if you must. Also, a note to English teachers: Please don't force your students to read such foul writings!!!"
negative,"Little results - if any: Wife didn't have any luck with this product. Much more luck with the fenugreek. She also claimed this tasted like ""goat ass."" She has a way with words. The do not drink before and after instructions are a pain. That and the taste of goat ass that you can't wash away makes this a lowsy product."
negative,"A dam of free thought: It's a sad commentary on society when people make money off a book that is degrading, prejudicial and judgemental about what people believe in. Wasn't the United States founded on religious tolerance? It seems to me that commercialism and industry has destroyed God and freedom from bigotry. If you shut your mind off from new ideas and concepts, how can you grow? This book only serves as a dam against free thought and dialogue."
positive,"It does its job.: There isn't a whole lot to say. for the price I'm pleased with my purchase, it does it's job and looks good while doing it."
positive,"Horrible!: Man this game is horrible! I mean, the graphics are pretty good, but the fighting mode is terrible. First Frodo attacks and most likely misses! And in the Mines of Moria, there is a huge glitch. I got past it, but there is another one! This game stinks!!"
negative,WASTE OF TIME: Don't waste your time or money on Dreamcatcher. This is definetly not King at his best. This book shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as The Stand.
negative,"Total garbage! Software terrible. No support. Don't buy!: I bought this adapter and it is going right back to Amazon. I installed it and the software would not load properly. I have a 6 month old HP machine running Vista. After searching the net, I found Vista drives, but they didn't work, either.What a piece of junk.I bet the hardware is fine, but without good software, forget it.I bought a Linksys WMP54G."
negative,"Why oh why don't you change, post -rock?: I purchased this album because a Wire Tapper compilation presented me with 'Flares' pt 3 or so, the ONLY stand out track on the whole album. I was expecting some complex sequencing, a little glitch core with drawn out guitars, with perhaps a somber or delicate mood. What I got was one original song surrounded by very poor reduxes of Explosions in the Sky, who also sound like poor reduxes of other bands, who sound like other bands etc. Sorry, but the melodies on this album are already outdated, as much as I appreciate the production value here [it does SOUND great], this album bored me with its seeming complexity once it was revealed to be startlingly simplistic."
negative,"look, have any of you actually written a paper on this book?: well I have, and this book has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever tried to write about. It is basically about nothing, and I had to write about that for a school paper! you would hate it too if you had to write about it for a flippin' school paper! Really, need I say more? I bet the people who loved it never had to write an essay about Amaranta's repeated refusal of love, and in about a week! Just ask everyone who's a junior at my school! It is a torture manual! Far too beastly a book to be dealt with, even for most english majors and teachers!I give it two stars because it has more substance than the stuff Allende and Amado put out."
positive,"Stealing a Bank - Everyone's Dream: Everyone's dream - Dortmunder's nightmare. Every-time I see a temporary bank I dream and then I remember the troubles Dortmunder and company have in this book. First - the wheels - removed when the bank is put in place. Second - where do you put a stolen bank? and third - the safe, can your lockman open it?I am happy that Victor is not a recurring character - appearing in only one more book in the seriesNobody's Perfect.I really don't like Herman either. He does not seem to be a very good lockman. He shows up again in Nobody's Perfect and inWhat's the Worst That Could Happen? (Dortmunder Novels).Overall, this is a good solid Dortmunder book but as the second in the series the team is not yet together.I have just discovered that Nobody's Perfect is book number three. After I reread it, I will find book 2,Jimmy the Kidand review both together."
negative,"Worst CD of 2003!!!: Clay Aiken is at his absolute worst. If you're going to spend hard earned $ on a CD don't waste it on this one. You can't even dance to this garbage. Spend your bucks on ""Speakerboxxx/The Love Below"" by Outkast and you won't be disappointed. BTW... Claymates, Clay belongs on Broadway!"
positive,1491: Absolutely excellent! Mann reviews all of the scientific findings and gets first hand information from researchers in the field about what the different societies were really like in the Americas before 1492. He debunks many of the myths and misinterpretations about the first people in this hemisphere. It is also a pleasure to read and not dry as many history books can be.
positive,A classic: For fans of fantastic and epic stories. This is just a great classic that you cannot miss. Tolkien gave us a door to another fascinating world to escape ours.
positive,"A museum exhibit inside a book: This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust."
negative,"not at Hitchcock's level.: This movie has a good cast but it is not up to the level like the Hitchcock's movies.I like Emma Thompson and the cast in other movies that were good,but I had a hard time getting into the story.If Alfred Hitchcock was to had seen this movie he may be very angry at the writers and director."
positive,"One word---AMAZING!!!!!!!: This cd is absolutely awesome!Daryll's voice is great,the musicianship is excellent.This is an all around great cd.BUY IT!!!"
negative,Be aware!: This cd does not work for a european cd player!They should have warned me when buying from Europe.I am not satisfied with it.
negative,"Aesthetically pleasing but not functional: While I like the looks of this set a lot, with its retro feel, I find the shaker to be in need of a design overhaul. Every time this is used (and it's been used by several people so I don't think it's a user problem) it spills while pouring! This has been very frustrating to lose good top shelf vodka because of poor design. I had to go out and purchase another shaker because of this problem so I would not recommend this set."
negative,"Problems printing in color after about a month of use: Things I like: wireless printing to Mac and PC, scanning, and copying. My paper never jammed. I bought this printer and used it for about a month before the color stopped working. I called support numerous times and it was a time-consuming endeavor. Each time, we would get the printer working only to have the color stop working a couple of days later. Due to the time it took to work with support and my busy schedule, I was unable to stay on top of it before my warrantee ran out...maybe that is the HP plan? Anyway, not only does the color not work, but if I don't set the documents to ""black only"", it will print blank space where the colors were. Very annoying. I also do not like how HP software installs all sorts of ""helpful"" stuff that pops up all the time. The only way I could see to avoid that was to only install the driver, but then I couldn't use the scanner."
positive,Contains leaks!: I use these overnight for my twins and they are awesome! I was wary at how thin they seemed but they rock at holding the urine. The diapers are heavy and full in the morning but the babies and their pajamas are dry. Great diapers!
negative,Poor Quality and poor Customer Service from CAP: I recently purchased a 300 lb. Olypic set from a local retailer (not Amazon). Several of the plates would not fit the barbell due to excessive cast material. I contacted CAP and sent pictures. After an initial e-mail acknowledging that I had lodged a complaint I have heard nothing further and in the mean time I have several plates I can't use unless I grind the excess myself. My set has a baked on enamel finish and this would require removing the paint. Next time I'll buy YORK.
negative,This was pretty bad.: Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects.One star.
positive,"Don't expect Indiana Jones and it will be good: I watched this movie for the first time after a friend told me it was just like Indiana Jones. With that in mind I watched and hated this movie. It took me several more attempts through the years to get that mentality out of my mind and watch this for what it is.This is more akin to Pirates of the Caribbean than it is to any Indian Jones movie. Where Indiana Jones is 90% archaeology and history and 10% Sci-Fi / Occult this is probably the exact reverse. The dialogue, though not great, is decent and funny at times. The protagonists are a motley bunch that stumble into success and find trouble easily. All in all it is a good film to watch.The basic story is that a historian/ librarian with her pocket picking brother and a wayward adventurer manage to unleash a curse that was put away 5000 years ago. Now it is a race against time and supernatural demons to save the Earth."
positive,"It's My Favorite: I don't know why, this Crowes record always seems to get the most rotation, in my car. It Could Be that it's starts strong and finishes strong. It is probaly the most solid of all the Crowes' albums. 'Nuff said."
positive,"Am I the olny one who likes this movie?: Halloween 3 is one the best of the halloween saga, but everyone bashes it because it doesn't have Myers, well I found it fun and somewhat creepy, if you're an open minded person see this movie otherwise I think you'll just think it's a bad film like everone else because there is no Myers, of corse it's not as good as the first 2 but hey it's better than the rest."
positive,Grandchildren loved it!: This was gotten as a Christmas gift and suggested by the parents. As soon as the gift was opened the grandchildren wanted to play with the toy.
negative,"An exercise in rationalization: C.S. Lewis builds foundations of logic based on faulty black or white situations, and then expounds his theories upon the trembling base beneath. The further an objective human being gets, the less steady the footing becomes. It is inconceivable to me that such a book can occupy a revered position to otherwise objective people. Of course, objective individuals are not the target audience. If you are a Christian, then this book will most likely confirm that you are indeed the best, the smartest, and the only truly righteous in the only way such a thing can be confirmed: Through rationalization, circular logic, and outright self-delusion. The misogyny and blatant hatred imbued in this dogma-filled tripe is offensive. It is interesting to an objective person only as an examination of self-delusion."
negative,POOR quality: I had a farbaerware saucepan for 41 years. It received frequent use and was a great product. I finally decided to replace it. The new saucepan is already pitted inside and the lip around the ouside edge is impossible to clean. The bottom of the pot has scratched the top of my stove. I really wish I hadn't disposed of the old one. This one belongs in the trash.
negative,"Works really well right up until it doesn't: It was a little big for me, but it worked really well until about two weeks ago. And then it just died. Mind you, this is two months after I bought it. I switched the batteries, made sure the ones I put in were working, but I suppose the motor died. I never even used it in water. I don't know about most people, but for $30, you'd think you'd get more than two months out of a vibrator."
positive,"Excellent system for the money: I purchased this kit to replace the stock exhaust on my 1998 XJ.Amazon had the best price I could find so I went ahead and ordered it along with a Magnaflow Cat.Shipping was amazing, had it at my door in two days.Installation was more or less painless. The hardest part was taking the old exhaust system off. For this I would suggest using a recip-saw or an angle grinder with a cutoff wheel. In this case I used a recip-saw.Mounting it was easy, just a matter of attaching the clamps and tightening them down. If you have one, I would suggest using an impact driver to do this. It would cut the time needed to install this considerably.The exhaust sounds great at idle and really opens up when you give it some gas. All in all a great product, we'll see how well it holds up to the Ohio winters though. I'll update if anything changes.*Bottom Line*Awesome kit, easy install, use a recip saw and impact driver if you have one."
negative,"Great book, bad product: The story contained in this book is excellent, but the book itself is junk. It appears that is was visually scanned from and older and more narrowly formatted print and then pasted into this print with little to no error checking. The worst result of this is that every word that was hyphenated across two lines in the original text appears broken and hyphenated even though it is now in the middle of a line (e.g. hyphen- ated). You will also see occasional misreads such as a number 1 in place of a lowercase ""L"".Find another printing."
positive,"Very Accurate, but somewhat mysterious: I Thought that the Book Helter Skelter, was very informative as well as vivid in telling about the true Manson crimes.It was a great description of the various people and deaths of the people there in Los Angeles, Cali. This book also is a great account of the death of the actress, Sharon Tate. This is a great book to help you find out more about the Manson crimes, the many deaths, and the use of the HELTER SKELTER to posses the murders."
positive,"Mozart on Steroids: I've seen Der Zauberflote performed two or three times and do not intend to miss any performances that I hear about. The opera itself is marvelous. This book/CD set manages to do it justice. Mozart is well performed, the CD is well made, you even get to read along with the book. Finally, the extra notes are a pleasure to read. What I am waiting for is a Black Dog DVD Opera series. However, until then, I really really like this set and I think that you will too."
negative,"wrong category !: This is not a book about climbing - which I found kinda funny for a book about mt. Everest; this book is about ms. Gammelgaard proving to herself ""she could be the first nordic woman to set foot"" on Chomolungma - big deal ! So maybe you can call this a tale of a driven, achieving lady who singlemindedly pursues a goal, but you will learn nothing about what happened in may, 1996 or about what being on mt. Everest is like; not even close to Krakauer's or Boukreev's books on the same topic: buy those instead."
positive,"A VERY RARE COMPILATION: 50'S SINGING TRIO, THE MCGUIRE SISTERS,HAVE RELEASED MANY CD ALBUMS, BUT IN MY OPINION THIS 36 TRACK 3CD COMPILATION BEATS THEM ALL BECAUSE IT COMPREHENSIVELY COVERS ALL THEIR HITS, INCLUDING THE ELUSIVE--""RED RIVER VALLEY"". When I saw it listed I immediately made up my mind to purchase it,and thanks to Amazon.com's association with GLIDS,the Marketplace Seller,I was able to get it down DIRECT to my home in Sri Lanka,and it came surprisingly pretty fast.I am very satisfied with the entire transaction, and I hope that in the interests of far away customers like me,Amazon com,will in the future establish more such links with Marketplace Sellers so that WE CAN ALL,wherever we reside, benefit by the arrangement."
positive,A classic story told in a nice edit: I sought out the Bantam Classic version of Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo as I feel it is presented in an easy to read format. The book allows many areas for note taking and highlighting. I would recommend this version of the classic to any High School or College Student who is studying this work. I also recommend Dumas' story as it is a great tale.
positive,"A Literary Classic With Tiny Flaws: In ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"", Hank Morgan is transported to the legendary times of King Arthur and Camelot. I thought that this novel was wonderfully put together. The way Hank instituted 19th century ideals into the 6th century was a perfect way to add pizazz to the novel. Although there were some parts in the novel that were slow and undeveloped, the best parts and the main parts over-shadow those. This novel is one you MUST-READ!"
positive,"Good Christmas Gift: I bought this from my son's Amazon Wish List for Christmas and was happy with the gift wrap I ordered. It looked very classy, and my son was very pleased!"
positive,"5 FOR ESTATE, 3 FOR THE REST: IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE 1 STAR REVIEW, I AM THE ONE THAT LEFT A COMMENT IN FAVOR, BUT WONDERING WHY THEY LEFT ONLY ONE STAR. IT HAD TO BE A MISTAKE BECAUSE SHE GAVE IT A ""HAUNTING"" REVIEW, IF NOT TOO SHORT. THE TUNE: 'ESTATE' IS WITH OUT A DOUBT A FIVE STAR TUNE. IN FACT, ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JAZZ VOCAL NUMBERS I CAN REMEMBER HEARING. HOWEVER, THE REST OF THE CD, I FEEL FALLS FAR SHORT OF ESTATE. ALL OF THE MUSIC IS SOFT AND NICE, BUT JUST DIDN'T GRAB ME PERSONALLY. REGARDLESS, YOU MAY WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY. IF NOTHING ELSE, IT WOULD BE NICE QUIET BACKGROUND FOR DINNER OR SLOW AND ALONE DANCING WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE."
negative,"This didn't even deserve one star: I read an excerpt from this book, and I could barely get passed the first paragraph! The writing is choppy, it's full of terrible cliches and is probably one of the worst works of literature I have ever read."
negative,"Bones: Damn, I purchased the series but can't seem to get into them. Boring character and I was so prepared to love her."
positive,"Turn on to this radio book.: A wonderful pictorial book about transistor radios, 175 of them, not only photographed but put in the context of fifties and sixties design. The spread on 60-61 shows six radios mixed with close-up photos of chrome styling from fifties cars. I loved the chapter on design with its photos of grills and lettering, even a spread on 9-volt batteries.This is the kind of book that Chronicle do so well, interesting subjct, well designed and printed all for the general reader. If you collect these radios you will certainly want to have a copy but don't expect to get lots of technical detail or a price guide. For that have a look at 'Collector's Guide to Transistor Radios' by Marty and Sue Bunis, plenty of text about seven hundred models, some photos and that all-important identification and price information."
negative,"v.2 Does Not Work With TiVo!!!!: While version 1 (WG111v1) works with later versions of TiVo, Version 2 has not compatibility whatsoever. To make matters worse, it is impossible to tell which version you got until you open the friggin box and look -- which is totally ludicrous. Bait and Switch, people, Bait and Switch."
positive,"Oops!: Many who hate this film have probably never seen it. I know my man thing thought it was some other movie, at least. Now this is not master cinema. This is another film where the original concept of the film was not adhered to in the sequel but was in the third. Halloween was intended to be about different stories about the spooky holiday. For that reason THIS should have been Halloween 2. It wasn't so people's expectations were set and that cannot be altered in part three. This was an okay film. It is about a druid follower who seeks to commit mass murder using Halloween masks and technology. Children are the primary targets. Those who say it has nothing to do with the Michael Meyers franchised film Halloween don't understand. This DOES follow the original idea. Michael Meyers DOES NOT. Sadly, as already stated, this one came one sequel too late."
positive,"A Wonderful Twist on the Boleyn Legacy: This book is the opposite of what is usually told about Mary Boleyn. I think this book might be a bit complicated for those who have not read any material before concerning Anne Boleyn, Mary Boleyn, Henry VII, etc. But other than that I could barely put the book down."
positive,"enjoyable 5th: I don't know if this is the definitive version of Bruckner's 5th, but I really enjoy this release. The sound quality and balance are excellent. The reading is controlled, but dynamic. This has to be the most difficult Bruckner symphony to critique because it is definitely a most unusual work, but I love it! When I want to listen to the 5th from Bruckner, I usually pop this one into my player. The Thielemann 5th (on DG) is also excellent, but it is sadly not SACD even though the sonics are still excellent. If DG decides to release the Thielemann on SACD I will definitely buy it, but I would still keep this one."
positive,"Xlnt quality and value!: The Dogg-Father Hoodie is made of quality materials and is very well constructed. Our boxer puppy, Sancho, looked so cute (and he is from the LBC...); it would have kept him warm on colder evenings.Unfortunately, we needed an XL and I haven't been able to find that size anywhere.Comparable hoodies in pet stores are not nearly as high quality. If your dog is about 30-40 pounds - and not too chesty, Snoop's Dogg-Father hoodie is perfect!"
positive,"Unforgettable: Friend had me watch, ""Last Tango in Paris."" I couldn't find it in any video store so I immediately looked it up on Amazon.com and abracadra...it was found! Great price and was shipped quickly to my house. How convenient!!! Keep up the awesome work. I use Amazon for book club on a monthly basis and I am really pleased with everything. Wish I could get better shipping prices...For example, my last book was only a one penny, but the shipping was over 2 dollars. Wish you could ship more than one book, better price.Happy customer, Riley"
positive,"Recent purchaser of Xantrex: It was easy to order this product online and it arrived when promised.Though we haven't needed to use the Xantrex 600 yet, we did charge it tested just fine with my small electric coffee pot. When the power was out because of Ike, that is what I missed most! WE are going to also order a 1500 because 10 days without power will use up 600 watts in no time. It powers our fan also."
negative,Breakable Plastic inner parts: Not a great glue gun. Must treat it very gently or the trigger handle that forces the glue stick forward will break. Cheaply made>
positive,"Girls Just want to have fun- love it: The movie is great...even works on my dvd player considering im in Australia (ALDI's DVD player)...The shipping is a bit to expensive, even if i'm in Australia....i've had and i know it should be cheaper.Would most likely buy again"
positive,"50 First Dates: Adam Sandler plays a guy that is about to giveup on love until he meets Drew Barrymore whohas a short-term memory loss, where she forgetseverything the next day; she can only rememberanything that has happened before the tragicmoment in her life that messed up her brain."
negative,"Awful movie.: Standard Michael Bay garbage. Totally removed from the original idea, especially concerning Optimus Prime's character. The ideals the character originally stood for are completely ignored in favor of kill shots and 'Murican tough guy crap."
positive,"Another Solid Effort From Smith, Tho Not His Best: First off, don't read this before its predecessor, ""A Falcon Flies."" All characters here are introduced in that book, the first of a four-book series on the Ballantynes. The first book is about the African slave trade, thickly larded with much sex and violence. This one's a bit better-- it follows lead character Zouga Ballantyne to the diamond fields of Kimberly, where he swears to make his fortune. We meet his sons and follow their adventures as well-- the book is best when it looks at the African tribes that must deal with white encroachment in the latter part of the 19th century. Smith writes gritty adventures/soap operas that entertain and inform, and while this one is good, it's not quite up to the standards of the Courtney novels, beginning with ""Birds of Prey."" Read that one first; if it piques your interest, you'll want to read the next 11 books in that series, then come back to try the Ballantynes...."
negative,Shuffled?: This item did not work very long. I made a call and it was replaced but that one did not work either. Just quit with it. Wish someone could design a shuffler that would WORK! It's a great idea.
positive,"Great Story!: This was my first Michener novel and I found it to be extremely entertaining. I too was disappinted that almost everyone dies off, but this isn't supposed to be a warm & fuzzy book, it's about a difficult journey made more difficult by the person in charge.Michener originally wanted to include this story in ALASKA, but that novel was already quite long. This is a perfect lead-in for Alaska and a great Michener book for the beginner or someone looking for something a bit shorter while between Michener classics."
negative,"T-shirt shrank half-way up my torso!: Ok, so I'm exaggerating a little bit, bit not by much. Where the Iron Maiden shirts used to be printed on Haines heavy-weight t-shirts, this shirt was printed on a Delta t-shirt. Shrank to the point where it looks like a belly shirt almost. Cheap, low thread count t-shirt. When ordering these rock shirts, be sure to ask the seller what kind of shirt it's been printed on. If you're like me, you like to keep your rock shirts around until they get nice and faded. The DELTA shirts won't last that long. The eact same thing happened with a new RIde the Lightning shirt, and I'm a little frustrated. The HAINES and GIANT brand shirts tend to be high quality and don't shrink. *Please note that this is not an issue with the seller, but with whomsoever is making Maiden's licensed stuff now."
negative,"waste of money: Don't waste your money- mine broke after a year and a half and when I called they told me the best they could do is give me deal on buying a new one for 80 dollars!! What- no thanks- we just spent $189 on one a year and a half ago! Find another system- I am very disappointed! Oh and I have known 6 other people who have had to return theirs within the first two years. So, I would wait to give this a review until you have had it about two years- I am guessing yours will break too- or don't register it so they don't know when you bought it- you will be out a lot of money!"
positive,"Chi Running: This is a great book with a whole new way of approaching running. Some of it I intuitively have known and practiced. A lot of it is a completely different way of ""practicing"" running."
positive,pass the tissue: Becoming Jane is a must see for those who havent seen it. Anne Hathaway did a great job playing Ms. Austen and James McAvoy stole my heart. I will say it is a tear jerker so make sure you have a box handy.. lol
positive,"A ponderous, insightful read: I was facinated by this book early on and couldn't often put it down for three days before I polished of the last appendix. Mann has done an impossible/ yet convincing job of bringing the pre-columbian world alive -showing it through a lens that magnifies and brightens. All sorts of opposing views are treated with respect - letting the reader sort out the wheat and shaff given the evidences presented. I lapped it up!Occassionally the book bogged down into so much detail that it was distracting - I wanted to shout ""Get on with it!"" I think the points could have been made in half the space. Yet, Mann has walked a delicate balance between a pedestrian world of interested people and the myopic and stuborn world of the university/smithsonian know it alls. Bravo to C. Mann. He's a genius and he's fun to read."
negative,"Honors English required: This book was required reading for my son's HS senior honors english course. He found it quite laborious to read and didn't like it - but it was required, so what can you do? DO not recommend for casual reading, but it's a great price if your child has to have it for school"
positive,Satisfied Reader: It's a very good story Hard to put down Story line is great Really got in to it Great read
negative,"for sci-fi fan; not English teachers: This version of Beowulf is perfect for those who enjoy Sci-Fi movies; however, if you are searching for a classroom supplement to the epic poem, this selection is not for you"
positive,EXCELLENT! A MUST BUY!: Every song on this CD is good. I can't pick a favorite song because I love them all. There is such a good variety as well. You won't be disappointed when you buy this CD!!!
positive,always amazing: one of the best shows ever. dvd showed up fine with no problems. make the right choice. buy the dvd.
positive,"Satisfied: Print quality is very good. Ability to access scanner, printer and memory card reader over network is a plus. Note setting up wireless can be abit tricky but not impossible, if you have some knowledge of networks it shouldn't be that bad. Con the range at wich you can place it my vary, walls and other obstructions can greatly decrease wireless signal. A must for small buisness or home network no more dedicated computer to host shared printer. If I had to I would definetly buy it again."
negative,"Dude, Where's My Car?: So, my brother, his friends and I decided one saturday night to check this film out.The previews made sure to avoid the ridiculously stupid ""aliens"" are after them plot that takes over the movie. It really isn't even about finding his car. The acting was bad, the plot was from one of the worst scripts ever made, and the only funny parts were all shown in the previews. The only reason this has received any good reviews is that almost all the people who watched it were young kids who think it is cool to like this horrible show. Do not even waste your time.If you're into stupid comedy, watch ""Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure"".SHIBBY..."
positive,"Finding Forrester.......: I love Thomas Sowell for his clear mindset and philosohy. I read almost nothing else but philosophy, and Sowell is at the top of my list for clarity, understanding and delivery. He does not receive, in my opinion, the recognition for his genius he is due. A must read.... as is all of Thomas Sowells books"
negative,"French Connection: WARNING: THIS BLUE RAY DISC IS THE WORST AND I MEAN THE VERY WORST FILM TRANSFER I HAVE SEEN ON VIDEO. SOME SCENES ARE ALL GRAIN. I don't care what they tried to do with this release, they just blew it badly. The PQ in a lot of the darker scenes is inferior to a bootlegged VHS tape. Just my opinion of course. The outdoor sunny scenes are fine. If you must see this one, RENT IT. NOT RECOMMENDED!"
positive,"I Like This Movie - A LOT: I like this movie - A LOT. In particular, I like the pace of the film and the interplay between the Hackman and Baryshnikov characters. Also, the ""confetti"" jacket that Géraldine Danon wears when she meets Hackman at the restaurant deserves a look-see on its own. Finally, I was in the military on active duty stationed in Heidelberg, Germany during the time the movie was being filmed. Between 1990 and 1993, I also visited Berlin (both the former East and West), Paris (Le Tour Eiffel - but of course!), and flew in and out of BWI airport frequently. Every time I see this film I am transported back in time to those locations to recall exactly how they appeared back when. When this movie is on the air, I can't look away."
negative,"Horrible acting, writing, directing: All the other bad reviews are good enough for me. I'm just adding my vote on this one as a one star. I can't fathom how the ones who ranked it as 5 stars saw the same movie as I did. The best thing about this movie was returning it to the Red Box I rented it from."
negative,"Don't like it: I bought the Soyo 24 inch monitor based on a $100 reduction in price at Office Max and what appeared to be a review on the internet. Previously I had a Viewsonic 17"" LCD monitor which was pretty bad too. The Soyo has a bad stand that is supposed to be adjustable, but I could not do it and had to prop it at an angle with a book. The User's manual is nearly incomprehensible. The speakers have to be the worst sounding ones I've ever heard. I am going to repack and try to return it and buy something better ever if I have to pay more."
negative,"The Book is WAY Better..and That's all You Really Need to Know!: Don't waste your money on a DVD unless: 1) You just want to see beautiful Italian scenery (and it is gorgeous!) or 2) You actually enjoy watching a whiny, sniveling, pathetic female character waiting for a man to fulfill her life. Doubt if the author was thrilled with this version of her story. BUY THE BOOK!!! It's a great read."
positive,"What? No other reviews????: I cannot believe that this album has not be reviewed before now. This is one of the most inventive recordings ever made! I have plundered almost all the songs for my radio show. If you are even very slightly interested in innovative music, hit the order button now and get this album! Transporting and transcendent! I just wish that there were other An Chang Project CDs to purchase."
negative,"What a sad little man: What the author of the book lacks in logic he makes up in angry rethoric. Feder simply makes no attempt at following the most elementary use of logic. His conclusions are pure dogma. For example, he (rightfully) criticizes Nazism and Communism for causing much horror throughout their respective history. However, when discussing Christianity, Feder argues that it cannot be judged because of all the bloodshed and wars it has caused because human beings distorted a good idea. In other words, it is ok to use empirical evidence to criticize ideologies I don't like, but not those I like. In other passages, Feder suggests that conservatives are a tiny persecuted minority. Which is all fine and well if it wasn't for the fact that they control the presidency, the House, the Senate, and the Supreme Court. The whole book is littered with similar examples of glaring contradictions. A classic case of ""my mind is made up. don't confuse me with facts."""
positive,"Fun for about 15 minutes.: Very neat toy, although I think I liked it more than my 8 year old. My first one didn't come with directions, so we were a little confused on what buttons did what. The company sent us some directions after I called and it made it much easier. My favorite part was the lights in the ""horn"" that change colors. My daughter was only intrested in it for about 15 minutes though."
negative,"Very good quality: I was pleased with the quality of the pet stroller. It even has places for your water bottle, cell phone, purchases (bottom tray). Rec'd in perfect condition, and delivery time was quick."
negative,"I hated it.: I Hated this book, it was very boring. I would read things I find on the ground before I read it again."
positive,"Runs small: I always get size 4 for my little guy, and so I ordered size 4 in Pampers Baby-Dry. I can barely fit them around his waist. My friend and I compared Pampers size 3 and 4 next to each other and we couldn't tell any size difference."
positive,"WOW: I've been flipping through the songs on Clay's CD that I just got. Wow~ I still can't get over his amazing voice. If you are thinking about getting this CD, DO IT~~! The lyrics are awesome and the whole CD is fantastic!"
negative,"doesn't live up to expectations: Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it's size. From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again. All in all, a disappointment and not worth the money it would cost to send it back."
positive,Holy Spirit: Anything Billy Graham writes is worthy! However it would have been exciting to read had he ever experiences the baptism of the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues hisself.
negative,"The Aulos Sopranino is FAR better: The Yamaha 300 series recorders are fantastic instruments. (I adore my soprano, alto, tenor, and bass!) Unfortunately, the Yamaha sopranino does not live up to the pure sounds of the others. It sounds both husky and nasal. The Aulos sopranino, which is about the same price, is a far better option."
negative,"Disappointing...: About the only good thing I can say about these Mr. Coffee Mug ""warmers"" is that they'll never burn your coffee. Even with the cup 2/3 empty, it STILL can't keep the coffee warm. If you like to drink your coffee hot and you want your ""warmer"" to keep it hot, this is most definitely NOT the warmer for you. If you like lukewarm, maybe it is, b/c that's the best it'll do.Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer"
positive,"Effective: This software has more than I could have imagined for Sign Language. Even when I took courses in it, I don't remember going through the grammar and sentence structure as thoroughly as this disk set does. Definitely something I would recommend to others."
positive,"great at keeping your mug warm: Love this little warmer! It's great at keeping bottom of the mug warm, keep in mind you might have to shake the cups a little to warm up the whole cup. However, don't expect to warm up a cold drink."
negative,"Good taste but...: First of all, make sure you get the Platinum PLUS machine. It doesn't cost much more, and it has a rinse button. This ad seems to be for the plain Platinum machine but I don't see Plus on Amazon anywhere so something is weird.The coffee that comes out of this machine tastes really good, but I hate the machine itself. It is so SLOW. I'd rather just drive to Dunkin Donuts. The water trickles out in a slow drip, which causes maximal splash-back all over the machine. Even when I just want hot water it droooools out so slow. And the controls are hard to remember, I'm always press press pressing to try to get the right size cup of water. I wish I got a different model, maybe not the Keurig brand, but still using the K-Cups."
positive,"Great kids story: This story is a great one involving magic, different worlds, knights and all the things that make fairy tales great. Any child who likes to read and has an active imagination will like this story. Geared a little more for boys, but I think most girls would appreciate it just as much. This was a favorite at our house growing up and is already on my son's bookshelf, though he is a little too young for it just yet."
negative,"the music may be swing....: I was majorly disappointed with the lyrics. Call me fickle if you will but, the sexual overtones in the lyrics were just too blatant. Swing to me has always been a refuge away from this. If I want to hear music about sex and such, I listen to rock, it's expected there. However, the music is first rate with tight rythms and wonderful horns. Peace........"
positive,I'm not going spelunking!: If ever a movie made me want to stay out of dark caves this one is it. Love the creepy dark surprises.
positive,"Didn't look like the photo: The vest is fine and it is constructed like the vest in the photo. However, it has some rather tacky screen printing on it to make it look like some sort of racer vest. I wanted a plain, solid-color, so that was disappointing. It fits fine and seems good quality, so I'll keep it. However, keep in mind that your vest may not be exactly what you're expecting.I bought these for myself and my teenage son. We're both slender people and the vest fits us fine. The top strap is NOT adjustable, so I think that someone really large would not be able to fasten it. It should be fine for average sized people."
negative,"Didacticism at its finest: Benji Franklin is a fascinating guy. He really is. Unfortunately, you really don't get to know him through his autobiography (it was written for the moral instruction of his son, first of all).Half the book reads like a ""Mrs. Manners"" column and the other half reads like a resume. Franklin lists all his numerous contributions to American society fairly coldly and not a little pretentiously (but we can allow him the pretention) and fills in the blank spaces with moral and philosphical instruction. ]While he was a great inventor and statesman and had a knack for collecting and spitting out trite ""truisms,"" Benny just isn't that interesting a moral philospher. If you're really interested in getting to know Ben Franklin, check out a scholar's biography--if anything, you get to learn all the juicy stuff about his disgustingly promiscuous sex life."
positive,"THE USUAL SUSPECTS: MY KIDS AND I LOVED THE MOVIE. IT'S YOUR USUAL KID OVERCOMING HIS FEARS AND BEATING THE BULLY STORY, BUT IT IS FUNNY. I THINK I MAY HAVE ENJOYED MORE THAN MY KIDS."
negative,"Murder in the Family: Honor Killings in America: Loved what I saw on the televised version. I went through two discs, however, that wouldn't play on any of my DVD players, only got a refund on one. A Muslim in their copy department? Order at your peril."
negative,Worse ever video: I ordered this DVD since I loved the Trinity movies. The picture was horrible. It was as if Fellini was on acid. The dubbing was terrible and the story was uniteresting. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
negative,"I wasn't impressed, BUT...: It's true that this film has nothing on the first two Anne movies. Not worth purchasing by any means. However, I did borrow a copy of it on DVD from my library and there is a 12-minute clip as a Special Feature of Marilla's death and various other occurences; the twins Davy and Dora, Rachel Linde, selling Green Gables. These are from the series 'Road to Avonlea' entitled ""Old Friends, Old Wounds"". I have not seen it myeslf, but it seems that this series is more like the first two movies, and truer to the books than this third one...something I will probably look into to help get over my disappointment in this film!Cheers."
positive,"Humidifier Replacement Cartridge: These replacement cartridges are great, Keeps the humidifier humming along. Hard to find sometimes, so having this source is great."
negative,Item seemed like it was used not a new product!: Item seemed like it was used not a new product! Oh well it is just a cheap toy and the kids will probably tear it up in a couple of weeks anyway!
positive,"Party and pets: I've played both of these games and they're a lot of fun. I personally like that you can have pets and its cool 'cause you get more and more cool things for your house. But you stay up late playing it, so you might say it's addicting, but it really isn't(you just have to be forced off the computor, though)."
positive,"TOTALLY UNIQUE, COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. BRILLIANT!: I loved this story and am sad to have just finished the last page. Maggie Osborne is a brilliant storyteller. Her heroines are unforgettable, strong, funny, and completely real. She paints such vivid portraits with her novels. Lady Reluctant has risen to the top of my favorites by Ms. Osborne. It's everything one wants a romance novel to be and more....I rarely laugh out loud while reading and this book did it to me! Get this book and enjoy...it's a great adventure that will have you longing for more."
negative,"Disgrace: Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting of Hill House is the greatest haunted house story ever written, and the 1963 film version is one of the finer examples of the horror genre ever committed to film, but this illegitimate 1999 re-make is a disgrace to the memory of the author, an inferior descendant of the original movie, and an all-around bad (bad bad bad!) motion picture. Alternating between groaningly, achingly terrible and downright silly, 1999's The Haunting loses its threadbare plot in a special effects quagmire, obliterates any of the greatness it could easily have inherited from this predecessors, fails to make use of the magnificent understated creepiness of the novel, and squanders a talented cast. Not only is it offensive to witness what was done with Shirley Jackson's work, this is just a rotten waste of time to see."
negative,"Freezes: The DVD freezes on the first chapter, that's the reason I chose this rating. The movie is a great movie itself. Just this DVD sucks. I would recommend the movie but not the seller."
negative,"I think i'll pass........: For the price, Image should have put out a better quality print than what was used in this disc. You can see this same print on a dvd called ""Film Noir Triple Feature Vol. 1"". This film has an alternate title of ""KILLER BAIT"" which is available as a better quality print in a 6 disc set called ""5 Film Noir Killer Classics"". I'm so glad that i was able to rent this disc through the mail FIRST. The movie is good as far as content goes. I think i'll pass on this transfer of it, though."
positive,"~Wolf Juice~: The book Never Cry Wolf is an excellent book. The characters are great. I think my favorite character would have to be Angeline, she's a smart and beautiful wolf. One of my favorite parts in the book though, is when Farely drinks the wolf juice. You'll have to read the book to find out what I'm talking about, but I would definitely recomend this book for everyone. It is absolutely hilarious and once you get going, you'll never want to put it down."
negative,"COULD BE BETTER: ONLY EPISODES OF 1999- I CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH FAN BUT DVD IS NOT The REASON SO THAT I LIKE The SHOW I ANOTHER THING SO THAT THEY CANCELLED The SHOW IF HIM GO SO WELL THEY COULD HAVE HAD IMPRESSIVE BATTLES LIKE:Ashton Kutcher vs Jack BlackNAOMI WATTSON vs Rene ZELLWEGERJASON LEE vs JUDE LAW""BUT NOOO THE SHOW IS CANCELED""THIS DVD IS VERY POOR NONCSINGLE PROBALY IS EAST DVD OF CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH THAT MANAGES TO REMOVELIKE RELESED ALL THE SERIES."
positive,"Hollywood Queens and then some: A hollywood over the hill Gay Blade,with few flicks to his producer credits except (The Bride of Frankenstein) focuses in on a handsome man gardener, exit gardening, enter modeling (with clothes on)up the ladder to modeling (with clothes off)Advances spurred and rejected, queen to swimming pool, face down.Acting and filming fairly well done. Academy award quality-definity not. Interesting story ? Well its different ?"
negative,No leaks but stinky and saggy...: I used this diaper for my 2 year old and once she urinated in it once it would sag half way down her leg. Also when I used them at night come morning they would smell so bad that her pajama pants and even sheets smelled of urine. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because they never leaked even when very full.
negative,"kind of cool at times: i like quarashi's sound, it's fun and enegertic. but it doesn't really move anywhere or explore any possibilites. i think they have some real talent but these guys seem too content just throwing out obscene expressions like a bunch of 15 year olds that have finally gotten a hold of the main office's pa system. i have to say that the people who try to push these guys as sounding like korn are TOTAL MORONS. quarashi sounds sort of like the beastie boys on steroids...that's the best comparison i can think of. if you're not really looking for anything deep or particularly inspiring but instead want some mindless music, quarashi is fun. but if you have enough of that in your collection already, skip this one."
negative,"I cant believe I'm reviewing this.: This movie is so tasteless, that it scares me that even one person gave it a good review. I mean come on, a pig nosed commando(yeah right) and a bunch of accomplices who would have trouble successfully making toast are gonna infiltrate the U.S. infrastructure and wreak havoc with the Aids virus? Asnd they are thwarted no less than by a bunch of air crash survivors who have to screw each other before they can muster up the guts to stop this evil plot. Oh man this is bad!"
positive,Recent Purchase: The book I ordered was exactly as described and delivery was even faster than promised.
positive,Best price on diapers: The amazon moms program has the best price even against stacking coupons at wholesale clubs. Only wish I had signed up earlier.
negative,"Typical Neil: I love most Neil Young but every fan knows that about one in three of his albums really sucks. After Greendale and Greatest hits, I'm very disapointed."
negative,"don't plan to play rented DVD's on this: This is an attractive player. The accessories were what sold me on it, and I was pleased with the package. I was disappointed, however, when I tried to play rented DVD's on it. It skipped very badly. I contacted Audiovox and was told that this is a low energy laser and that DVD's need to be clean to play in it. The same DVD's that skipped so badly in this player played fine on my husband's Toshiba laptop."
negative,Don't buy this printer!: The constant printer jams make this printer unusable! And don't buy the baloney that those of us having problems have not followed the manufacturer's directions. The thing jams with HP's own (expensive) paper no matter how many pieces of paper are in the tray.
negative,Casting the First Stone: I chose this rating because I haven't read the book yet. I enjoy Ms. Roby's books. I have a few more that I haven't read yet.
positive,"Simply brilliant!: This is a great start to learning Austrian economics, or rather, any kind of economics. All members of Congress should be required to read this before being allowed to vote on any bills. Peter Schiff's ""Crashproof"" would be a great followup to reading Economics in One Lesson. And for the more serious student of Austrian economics, especially in these times, you should read von Mises Theory of Money and Credit, and Rothbard's The Great Depression."
negative,"A classic touching tale.: John Steinbeck is one of the greastest writers ever and he proved it when writing this book. I'am 17 years old and had to read this in English, I read it in two days I couldn't put it down it touched me like no other book has done before."
positive,Star Blazers First.Series: It was a pleasure to see this series again. Even though I watched it as a kid it makes so much more sense now watching it as an adult. Video seemed a little grainy but that was probably good quality for that time. Stream lagged a little once in a while but wasn't too bad. Recommend it to people who watched it as a child and think today's teenagers might enjoy it too although they might find it a bit cheesy compared to modern day television and.movies.
negative,"It should be titled as ""An Intro to Windows Pieces"": The book only contains the very high level overviews or technical commercial. It is totally BS for MS Press to say ""This Kit offers complete preparation for taking and passing the Microsoft Certified Professional Exams 70-160 and 70-161"". If you want to know how many pieces that Windows has, this book may be OK."
negative,"don't be deceived: These headphones sound good at first but (a) they're very fragile and (b) only really cancel out white noise, making the more annoying sounds (e.g. people talking on a train) even more annoying."
negative,disappointed: I ordered two copies of this video as I have seen it before and it is excellent.One copy was given as a gift and it does not play. :(I have not opened the second video to see if it works. Plan to do that today.How do I get a replacement?
positive,A Gift Of Hope and Love: My fiance sent me Hope from the USA as a gift. Hope is a symbol of our love and commitment even though we are an ocean apart. Hope is so special with her closed eyes and praying hands which gives me hope that until the day my fiance and I marry. Hope is a wonderful bear who is so peaceful and filled with so much love. She calms my inner peace everyday as I go along my merry way each day and always know that my fiance loves me and is loyal to me as I am to him. Hope has given much joy all thanks to a wonderful man who loves me and who believes in our love and commitment. Thank you Hope for giving my fiance and I so much Hope until we are permanently together
positive,Excellent movie: This is was a small market movie (saw it in the theater; have not yet listend to the blu-ray so this is not a completely fair review of the actual product; though I did purchase it). Think garden state (though the story is very different). 100% recommended heart warming story.
negative,Kindling: I purchased this book only to use it in a book-burning party with a few good friends. Paolini is not worth your time or money; Tolkien and even Rowling and Brian Jacques have more to say and better ways of saying it. Please purchase this book if only to burn it.
positive,Son loved it: My son loved this. He has been collecting these books so he was happy to get it as a Christmas gift.
negative,"Where is Ware?: I had hoped this book would have more about Chris Ware, but most of it is the author's boring observations about comic art and his theories about what Ware is drawing. I would much rather read about the subject's childhood, and especially the details of his time in art school and in Austin. Instead there's endless verbiage in the Scott McCloud vein. A few interesting reproductions of Ware creations I hadn't seen before are included, but not much else is worth recommending."
negative,"Down hill slide: The Clan of the Cave Bear was a remarkable beginning to Auel's series. The Valley of Horses continued with Ayla's struggle to survive, ending with finally meeting one of the Others. The Mammoth Hunters starts turning into prehistoric soap opera, introducing another man to compete for Ayla's affection, while Jondular mopes around. The slide started there. The Plains of Passage was nothing more than traveling and sex scenes. Now we have the Shelters of Stone. I guess I thought that after the Plains, Auel took 12 years to bring back some drama and plot, and improve the series. Turns out she must have had writer's block, and the publisher obviously forced her to get something, anything, worked into a manuscript. The editor did a terrible job. This book should have been 400 pages instead of 750. I had anticipated this book, but now I think it's only worth reading out of curiosity and as a bridge to the next and final story, which I will probably be too old and decrepit to read."
positive,"The stronger recording: While I do enjoy the original broadway recording of this musical, this version is so beautiful that it is hard to see any better."
positive,"Lesser known films from a great film couple: These movies are all gems, confirming the great teaming of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Somehow seeing them together never gets old. I also have The Thin Man series on DVD and this is every bit as good. I would have liked to see a few more extras, including commentaries or interviews, but the movies themselves are worth the price. It's a great chance to see lesser known but great films by great stars."
positive,"Well Worth The Effort: I am a relative newcomer to the security field. I have been adding books to my library to help me in my job. I picked up Defending your Digital Assets and was pleasantly surprised. The sections on Security Verification of Systems and Networks and Cryptography were a rare read, and very enjoyable.I also found the chapter on Biometric Countermeasures one of the clearest presentations on the subject, that I have found in print.The authors clearly understand the INFOSEC field and their writing shows it. They make difficult concepts interesting. Too many books on this subject read like swiss cheese or with too much useless detail. Defending is the exception. I liked it. I recommend it."
positive,"Why 5 stars? Because there's no 6th: A friend of mine called this book ponderous; she read it in 8th grade. Go back to this one; I keep returning to it myself. Maybe it's in response to my parents' divorce. And how Hawthorne handles adultery -- not the danger and desire, but the punishment and crime. Hester's story begins outside the jail house. An American sex crime. Read it as such. Trust Dover for a good, cheap reprint."
negative,"Ummm.. Don't know what to say: I don't like this book so far. I haven't read all of it, and if my opinion changes, i intend to post another review. But after reading Flowers in the Attic, I find it hard to fall in love with Olivia like I did Cathy or any other heroines. She just seemed so harsh in FITA, that it's difficult to believe that this is the same grandmother"
negative,Deeply Disappointing: I agree with all of the reviewers who were disappointed in this book. What I had hoped for was a final visit to Mitford with stories about all my favorite characters and a nice tying up of loose ends. Instead we are introduced to a myriad of new characters who aren't very interesting especially as this is the final book in the series and their stories will go no further. What was Ms. Karon thinking? I wanted so much for the final book in the Mitford series to be about Mitford! Definitely wait and get this book from the library - its not worth adding to your Mitford collection.
negative,"man I really wanted to like this movie: First off I would like to say that I love Nirvana's music I have every CD, but I really hated this movie. Kurt would be really disappointed someone even made a movie about him and he would probably be more pissed that it sucked. He was an extreamly talented musician and he deserves to be remembered way better than the way the decided to portray him. I also beleive he did not kill himself but was murdered. Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, also a very good band, recently stated she beleives kurt was murdered. The fact is though that Gus Van Sant made a terrible movie. Anyone of you trying to force yourselves into beleiving you like this movie don't cheat yourselves you know it was so bad no one could really enjoy it. Even if you are a big fan of Kurt or Van Sant this was bad. If nothing else Kurt tried to teach us to come as we are so don't try to force yourselves to like a horrible movie for the sale of Kurt or Van Sant. I hope this helped someone.thanks zack"
positive,2K3: This is the same as playstation2 verison i love all ov the 2K's this has better graphics then playstation2 but this is a good gane overall.
negative,"antenna sucks! I recommend a more modern antenna!: okay, first of all it works, but the thing is that the antenna it comes with is sort of short, i mounted it to the top of my case, but it just looks sketchy.Secondly, the antenna broke on me today, and if you dont have the antenna connected to the pci screw in-no wireless... the screw in (with the little black tape that goes around the wire) is very sensitive almost to the point where its unfair. and like i said, no antenna no connection. my antenna broke off at the base and it makes the wireless pci care useless.And lastly, like i mentioned before the antenna looks like something out of the 80's with a little cliche tabletop design, but i just mounted it to the top of my case, and it still gets in the way when i take my case out to work on it.Im sure that this wireless card works fine connectivity and signal and all that, but once your antenna breaks its all over- NO MORE CONNECTION"
positive,"awsome read!: this book is a great read for any cat lover. it kind of says that anyone from any where can fit in. it is about a cat struggling to prove himself worthy of being in a clan, and only with a few friends to help him."
positive,Excellent bed and for the price. Sets up quickly.: I was unsure what size to buy so I bought this twin size bed and then a queen size bed. The twin size (THIS BED) sets up quickly and FIRM! Whereas the queen size bed id more burdensome in size and labor. I recommend this twin size bed by Intex model.
positive,"True Bionic Serum: The title say it all. This Exuviance-Vespera Bionic Serum the only brand I trust to my skin. I'm using this product for about ten years now my skin looks youthfull than ever. I'm glad this product is always available. I recommend this to my friends and family, after only few applications they notice the amazing results on their skin. I thank the company for marketing a real skin care that trully works. I will not use other product except this Vespera Bionic Serum.Marietta Parry Exuviance - Vespera Bionic Serum"
negative,"Atrocious!!!!: Besides the obvious disgrace of the plot and character assassination, I was surprised that not many people mentioned the actual jump in time. The first novel is placed in 1878. How could Anne and Gilbert be in their 20s by 1914? That would be 36 years after Anne came to Green Gables, which would make her in her late 40s by the time the war begins. Does that mean they had a 20 year engagement? How does that make any sense? I think they could have done so many wonderful things with this story and they wasted the opportunity. What a shame."
positive,"Excellent-though some inaccuracies...: Brilliant book- informative, detailed and painstakingly researched. I would also like to share my sadness at John Howard's passing...however, even Ambrose admits that not all the veterans who took part in the action agreed on what happened, but it is said that John Howard himself was not very happy about the amount of inaccuracies there were over the details of what happened that day. However, this should not overcloud the fact that this is a brilliant book and a must read for any historian. Stephen Ambrose has done it again..."
positive,"Not the best of her books but still high quality...: The descriptions and stories are great, though sometimes the nature descriptions get a little out of hand. The book is interesting and you can learn from it, and at the same time it's exciting. I would off course encourage anyone to read the book, but I would also say there is more to look forward to."
positive,"Deluxe Edition - Book rating: Really good story,good quality of leather, rich book, illustrations,interesting price for a wonderfull book both story and presentation (form)Silmarillionin Deluxe Pocket Edition?"
negative,"Not nearly great enough to close the Millenium: It's a fine album, just not for David Bowie. The man is a genius as his earliest efforts and his recent bold ""Outside"" prove, but this is not the CD of a genius. I'll say it: trite"
negative,Not As It Would Seem: Not as advertised. These copies are remaindered and are marked on the bottom as such with a felt-tip line. I had purchased this as a gift but was unable to give it due to the remaindered marking. The online information about these books fail to mention their remaindered status.
negative,"Horrible: Don't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots. They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money. First off the boots had spots around the lower edge(where the boot and the rubber bottom meet) where there were huge holes where there was missing glue. Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house. They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on. They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards. The ""insole"" they put in the shoe is a joke at best. It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite. Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear."
negative,not worth the money!: I thought this would be a good card game for our then 5 year-old. It held no interest whatsoever. It has just been sitting around so we finally gave it away as a donation.
positive,"Great ""OLD"" Story: This is a WW 2 story I never get tired of seeing around Pearl Harbor Day each year. The actors are really good and the story line is exciting, even though it was a sad time in the history of our great nation."
positive,"MEASURING UP!: Clay's debut album is amazing. Every track is very good listening. There are fast, slow and mid tempo songs. Clay's voice is superb! He has delivered a wonderful first CD that is able to be enjoyed by fans of all ages. He sings songs about a variety of subjects from all relationship angles. Just hearing this CD is uplifting. Excellent!"
positive,"potty mouth: great movie, but too much sweraing in it!great action screanes, are they giong to bring back megatron as galvatron we should also see unicron"
positive,"Simplifies Adding Water to your Saltwater Aquarium: I have to top off my Nanocube periodically and this is a great product for treating tap water... I've never had trouble with my tank chemistry while using this, and it really does a great job of binding with the chlorine and other chemicals and making the water safe..."
positive,"NOT QUITE HUMAN: THE WEAPON MAKERS by van Vogt is really an oldie that appears to have survived the test of time. Why? The main character, Hedrock, was born immortal by a genetic accident and he has been searching centuries for the secret to immortality, hoping to share it with the rest of mankind. Why? As many old timers assert, it isn't that much fun to outlive everyone you know.What was fascinating about this piece was van Vogt's attempt to portray an immortal human. Here was a character who had access to centuries of scientific invention. Since he was the only immortal, he took it upon himself to decide if and when these inventions should be released to benefit mankind. This is a god-like chore. Who would want this responsibility? Who would want to continue their life under these conditions? Hedrock did. Which goes to show that Hedrock wasn't human. Humans all die on time."
positive,Heads up- more of a packet than an actual book: I agree that this is a valuable addition to the small library of books for working mothers. But a heads up-- this is more of a bound packet than a book. It has a photocopied-type cover and looks like it was printed on a standard laser printer with double spaced Times New Roman font. Publishers-- someone work with the author to get a shiny new updated version please!
negative,Don't think download to my Surface!: This is not in my book selections. I keep having problems with digital downloads to Surface RT from Amazon. Do not understand their problems.
negative,"Read this if You're Stupid and wish to be Fanatically Stupid: Very Stupid. Once you enslave your mind to a blind, fantasy-based, utopian distortion of capitalist society, which has nothing to do with the actual functioning of that system on any level, at anytime whatsoever (and the top beneficiaries wouldn't have it any other way - no matter what this economic-libertarian garbage espouse), this is what comes out of your pencil. Read this book, turn off the real world, and turn on to a reactionary and libertarian-utopian rehash of greed, plunder, pillage and plutocracy WORSHIP touted as ""common sense."""
positive,"Excellent, almost perfect.: It is a beautiful book. Horrific, unforgettable images and a lot of tragic emotions. I would not mind to see a bit less of the American point of view, less sentimentality and more universal view, but that's only my opinion. Overall, it's a keeper."
negative,Broken Case: Movie was good but the handling of it during shipment leaves a lot to be desired. The case was broken during shipment and the DVD was sliding around inside when I received it. The movie began to skip about half way through it due to the scratches. Not sure if I would risk ordering another.
negative,"Sorry, but I couldn't turn off my intelligence...: ...because according to some reviewers, that's what I need to do to enjoy Eragon. Stop overanalyzing and enjoy the story, right? I could do that if the poor writing weren't so obvious. That way, I wouldn't be distracted by thinking ""oh, that's so cliche"" or ""that's really predictable"" or ""every character talks and acts the same way"". To be a good book, you need an interesting story AND decent writing. Eragon barely succeeds at the former, and completely fails at the latter."
negative,"Not what you may think: I may be stupid but I thought this was a point and shoot controller when I ordered it. It is really just a mouse that looks like a pistol, pull the the trigger to click the mouse etc. I found no use for this device, maybe some would enjoy the feel of a gun in their hand when playing FPSs, not me."
negative,My mess up: I got the correct movie but not the right format I guess I was not looking when I order figured only dvds were being sold now but I got a VHS not happy had to send it back lost money since i had to pay for shipping.
negative,"Twisted and boring: The characters motivations are disgusting and the acting is poor. I decided to watch this film since its supposed to be a cult classic and everyone talks about how Brando did such a find job.Call me crazy but when watching a film I like to at least like one of the characters. Here I felt like I was at a party with a bunch of people I didn't like but couldn't leave. Talk about No Exit.I guess some of you will like this film but unless you're one of those bleeding heart, artsy farsty people I suggest you save yourself the pain of trying to watch this film."
negative,"This movie would be better left alone...: The one page ad in Revolver mag made this movie sound great. The dvd cover boasted ""...makes 'Kids' look like an after-school special."" No ultraviolence as stated, just line after line of obscenities. This movie is not comparable to 'Kids'. This movie will go to the DVD trader as soon as possible. You want some vulger stuff go watch 'Meet the Feebles' or 'Requiem for a Dream', not this poop made by kids in their late teens and early twenties."
negative,"Doesn't Fit: I ordered this DashMat for a specific vehicle, it was not the correct mat. I returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat. I can't seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box!!!!!!"
negative,"How not to write a serious book: I recently took a history of science course (the Learning Company) by Lawrence Principie, who holds dual appointments at Johns Hopkins (Organic chemistry and The History of Science). In one of the lectures he spent considerable time spotlighting this book and expressing his conviction that NO serious student of the history of science takes this book seriously. It is full of errors; the author misquotes sources and is generally thought of as a great example of how a book should not be written and how an author should not do his research. Read this book but don't take it seriously."
negative,"Formula Writing: I have been a Higgins fan for many years, and have read and collected almost all of the books he has written. Some were great and full of suspense. But the last three he has written, including this one, ""Edge of Danger"", are very disappointing. He has resorted to producing 2 books a year, based on the formula of a superficial story line with no depth, predictable characters, and it seems that he now writes just to capitalize on his prior reputation as a good suspense writer.Count the number of Marlboros smoked, the amount of Bushmills and champagne drank, (and in the midst he changes his champagne brand which makes one wonder whether he has received a better commission from one favorite to another), and you find a shallow book. I would save my money on this one, and buy it only if you collect Higgins First Editions, hoping to capitalize someday on the commercial side of selling all Higgins books to a collector."
negative,Yummy suckers: I love these suckers but half were broken and I couldn't use them. I wasn't able to complete my classroom project with my students.
negative,"Low Quality: I bought this for my son, who has bad asthma at times. I thought I could use it to listen to his lungs, but the quality is very bad.The diaphragm is plastic, and I really have to strain my ears to hear normal breath sounds, let alone crackles or wheezing.Upon recieving it, I found that one of the tubes was bent from sitting in the box for too long. It is irreversible.Although the stethoscope looks all right and works realtively well, I don't recommed buying it just because it's cheap."
negative,"Not impressed: We love coffee... particularly Kona Coffee, which we buy from Hawaii regularly. While in DC, I stayed at a place that had this machine. For a week straight I had the best cup of Green Mountain coffee every morning. I loved the time savings of not having to grind your own beans, and it looks really cool! So I logged online and bought it the next day, along with the carosel and every coffee, hot chocolate, and tea product you could imagine. The Tea is pretty good, but we haven't had a good cup of coffee yet! Coffee is weak on largest cup and too strong on lower cup size. Type of coffee doesn't seem to make any difference ... they all taste terrible. Even tried our own coffee with the special attachment. No good. My husband wants our old $60 coffee maker back!"
positive,"INTERESTING: I did not find this to be the best of Alice McDermott's works, but I did enjoy it........Rick and Sheryl are high school sweet hearts. Sheryl's father died suddenly, leaving an empty place in her heart. She fills that emptiness with Rick and when she tells her mother that she might be pregnant, her mother immediately sends her from their home in a Long Island suburb to an aunt's family in Ohio....Sheryl did not even have time to let Rick know and he is going crazy trying to find her until finally, one evening he and some pals armed with chains go to Sheryl's house causing a riot......The men of the neighborhood come to the aid of Sheryl's mother and the boys get arrested and everyone gets treated for minor injuries......In the meantime, Sheryl tried to reach Rick by phone, but never was able to talk to him.......Sheryl and Rick go on to live out their lives as their destiny dictates.......This story brings us back to our own teen years and first loves."
positive,"An heirloom for every American: As the Library of Congress marks our country's history as the U.S.'s continual time capsule; this tome offers a glance into her walls. Beautifully assembled, this keepsake will instill pride in its citizenry. Making selections from myriad possibilities must have been a dire undertaking, but those represented indicate a fair cross-section of time and geography. An excellent tribute to a worthy source!"
positive,"an initiation into the world of real estate: Yes... Ron is right... 'don't expect miracles from a book.' Folks... this isn't a read a few chapters and suddenly be a genius type thing. He gives you examples of ways he has made tons of money in real estate and you shouldn't expect everything to work as planned or for there to be everything you need in this book. You still have to work your market... test stuff out... gain experience... learn the ropes... etc etc. For all the naysayers... I would say read it again and again... buy a few other books too... join some real estate forums... if you really want to succeed in real estate. And about his plugs for his bootcamps/courses... they are very good... but you don't need them... do with what you have and take ACTION.I'm reminded of a saying I heard a while ago ""We will either find a way or make one."" Good Luck"
positive,"Outstanding book: This book was a fantastic book. It really shoes how a society without rules would turn in to. Although bloody and not the happiest story, this author really put a lot of work into this book. I am glad i read this and would recommend this to anybody. I enjoyed reading this and so will you."
positive,"TOO GOOD FOR WORDS: Do I like this CD? You bet I do! Like most of the reviewers here I play it everyday and have yet to tire of it. Clay's voice resonates its way right into your heart. However, the is one point that I would like to make here and that is - Regardless of whether Clay Aiken ever sings another song, records another album, wins or loses, receives another award, applause or accolade and regardless of whether he receives good or bad reviews, it in NO WAY diminishes from the Measure of this Man!!!!! He and his album are awesome! Clay stands alone and apart from the rest. Thank you Clay Aiken and Thank You God for this gifted and talented individual. I am sooooo grateful and I am eagerly awaiting your next and next and next albums. Way to Go Clay and Happy 25th Birthday!!!!!"
negative,"Not sure what happened: Three days after receiving this uranium, all seemed well, only now, every day I come home from work, I can't seem to figure out if I have a cat. Weird."
positive,"Wonderful!: Men, if you want to wear panties, or Women, if you want to see your man wearing panties, BUY this! Yes, the front is ""poofy"" in the front and at first I was disappointed by it. However, after I put it on it felt wonderful! Loved walking around in it feeling my ""package"" bounce around in the front. When I became erect if felt fabulous! I am ordering more of these! If you want a tight snug fit, the this isn't for you, if you want room to grow, enjoy the soft silk feeling, then by all means, buy this. The sizing runs a little large, so order the next smaller size."
positive,"A Flawed Classic & a Sentimental Favorite: I'll start by saying I TOTALLY agree with my fellow reviewers regarding the use of recycled footage from Tora,Tora,Tora! & other WW II movies, footage of aircraft & ships either not present at Midway or not even in service until well after the battle as well as the incomplete feeling you get watching the film without the Coral Sea scenes.I first saw this movie during it's 1976 theatrical release as a 9-year old & as flawed as it is Midway is the movie that inspired my interest in WW II, military & naval avation of 1914-45 & history in general so for that I'm grateful. I'll simply add that this movie needs to be reissued in a restored edition to reflect the original release......even the dopey scenes with Matt Garth's girlfriend!""I think his only problem might be......Enemy identification"""
positive,"An affordable collection: Amazon completely understands how complicated it is to find a collection that other stores are not selling anymore. If you are looking for anything that was 10, 15, or a few decades ago, Amazon has it all. Old with the new, and new with the old."
negative,"If you want straight biomechanical and physiological advice.: ...then get Programmed to Run by Miller or Efficient Running by Cady. One has a PhD in exercise science and the other has a Master's degree in physical therapy. No spiritual advice, just sound physics, research, and observations of elite runners."
negative,"picture/manufacturing quality is lacking, pixelation problems abound: While everyone else is talking about the direction and editing of this movie, has anyone noticed that the picture quality on DVD is much worse than you would expect from a blockbuster. I expect that they cut costs in manufacturing. I remember when everyone was saying the DVD/CD was the greatest next thing because it would not break and could store vast amounts of information. There was poor picture quality and pixelation the first time through on this Harry Potter 4 DVD. Its like guns, guns don't kill people, people kill people. In this case, poor DVDs don't make pixelation; manufacturers who won't make quality DVDS make pixelation problems. Shame on them!"
positive,"Essential Neil Young-Success: I have long been a Neil Young fan. His music ""rings home"" to me. The music resonates as far back as the ""Crosby,Stills,Nash, and Young"" days. ""Prairie Wind"" is one of Young's best works. The album is one excellent performance followed by another.The music is symphony-like and captivating.I purchased the CD and the ""Heart of Gold"" DVD the same day. Subsequent to listening to ""Prairie Wind"", I said, ""Wow!"". I like the inclusion of the lyrics on the CD jacket. After viewing the DVD, I said, ""Spectacular!"". If a singer/songwriter should write about that which he knows, and a performer perform with both knowledge and heart-felt emotion, then these performances define success. As a son of the Prairie, I say ""Five stars."" and ""Two thumbs up!""."
positive,"Great Insight Into Spiritual Gifts: Very inspiratonal book! In a period dominated by extremes, Carraway writes a balanced view of the spiritual gifts God intended for us. His writing style is easy to read and speaks to you in a new way. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever struggled with ""why's"" Great book!"
negative,"This does not fit certain bikes: It would be nice if they specified in the description of the product that it will not fit a number of different styles of bikes. I have a carbon frame bike that it won't even come close to fitting because of the size of the downtube. It also will not fit an aluminum frame bike my daughter has for the very same reason. Because of the cost to return, I kept it and gave it away to someone with a standard butted steel frame. I am disappointed that it didn't work for me and I wasted my money. Again, the limitations of this stand should be included in its description."
positive,Not bad but...: I haven't seen this version yet (since it has not yet been released) but I can tell it is the edited version (by the length of the film--only 132 minutes). When are they going to turn out the full length version with the footage of Charlton Heston's girlfriend and the Coral Sea footage? Too bad since that's a big part of this film.
positive,"Another great book: I really like Reich's style. The fact that she's a real life forensic anthropoligist gives great credence to her work. I've read all 3 of her books and each is just as interesting as the previous.I hope to read more about her undercover friend in future publications. Just like Kay Scarpetta, she needs a social life!"
negative,"Both Stars are for D'Onofrio: I too bought this on VHS for Vincent D'Onofrio. My only negative comment about his performance is that there's not enough of it! I'll say right here and now that I'm not a big fan of Smits or Scacchi, and D'Onofrio overpowers them every time he's on screen. It's a beautiful story, and I can see why director Gillian Armstrong was attracted to it - it is a love story with a bit of real-life depth (rather than those soapy ones where the ridiculous problems are created by the characters for lack of imagination - Julia Roberts films, anyone?). That being said, the two lead roles needed to be played by stronger actors, and ones that could keep up with D'Onofrio vivacity. Worth a look for fans."
negative,"Acid based: Too strong to use on my dog. After trying it on me, I stopped. Too much acid. Not good. Sorry"
negative,"Too pricey for an Ebook: I wanted to get this for my 16 year-old son, but refuse to pay the price for the Ebook. I love my e-reader and hope to never buy a traditionally bound book again, but when the Ebook is more costly than a bound book .... Well Amazon just lost a sale.With that said, I think anyone who is an officiando of great Sci-Fi, that has something to say, should read at least the first three Dune books. I personally got burned out after three, but have never forgotten the ones I read and would love to share them with my son."
positive,"Great watch...: I ordered this watch back in 2006. I wore it every day for the last 6 years and it had many hours in the pool/water and close to 100 dives on it, with one dive as deep as 137 feet back in 2008. Awesome watch. However, the last time I took it in to have the battery changed, the jeweler (I guess) didn't put it back together correctly and it flooded 2 weeks ago. So, it is no longer working. Although I did love this watch and it's smaller size (I'm not a large male with big wrists) I am going to purchase an automatic watch this time so I don't have rely on jewelers to change out the battery."
negative,"Tested it's Effects: None: On an empty stomach, in a controlled environment, with plenty of water, I felt no physical change to stress levels, at least not the way that you feel an immediate sense of relaxation from Xanax. Like homeopathic medicince (highly diluted), this product is bunk.But it tastes good, and maybe it could have a little placebo effect."
negative,"Doesn't work with Win2000: It simply doesn't work with my Win2000 & Apple base station.Not with the original driver, nor with the updates that can be downloaded from the Belkin site. Sad story. The frustrating thing is that sometimes it's ok, but then after a while it just dies. With the whole OS. Since I got the unit, I keep restarting my frozen computer..."
positive,"Long time fan: I read this book a number of years ago (about 10 times!!!) and I lent it to a friend. I believe he lost it so I bought a new copy and I still love it. It's just a fun series of short stories, very enjoyable."
positive,"Good metal.: They are no doubt talented in their genre of music. Very fast paced music as always, this CD is full of hardcore guitar riffs. I can't help but to always picture a crazy mosh pit involved in every one of their songs. If I were to choose a single song to decide whether or not to buy this CD, I would pick the song ""Last Breath"". Some good metal. Rhapsody categorized this album as well as Hatebreed in general under ""Metalcore"". Remember that if you are going to buy this album, this is Hatebreed so expect a whole lotta screaming. Hatebreed to me is the official ""head banging, mosh pit"" band of today, and this album definitely shows it. It even comes with a poetic title."
negative,SOPHMORIC: I REALLY DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS BOOK AT ALL. I FOUND BOTH THE WRITING AND THE STORY LACKING AND UNIMAGINATIVE. I BOUGHT THIS BOOK WITH AN INTEREST IN FANTASY THAT REVOLVES AROUND ELVES OR FEY. I WAS SORELY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS BOOK. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER'S FEY HERITAGE. THE STORY ITSELF IS CHOPPY AND THE CHARACTERIZATION WEAK. A WASTE OF BOTH MONEY AND TIME. I WILL NOT BE READING ANY MORE OF THIS AUTHORS BOOKS.
positive,"Overall purchase: I wasn't sure what to think of the movie since I remembered hearing little about it. But it has become one of my favorite movies, especially war movies that try to tell some real truth about the time frames they cover. The aerial scenes are outstanding and it's actually good to know they could be done without injuries or crashes like some of the first World War I movies (Dawn Patrol comes to mind). The movie also pulls no punches about there being no glory in dogfights: if you were shot down, if the enemy's bullets didn't kill you the fall and crash most likely would. I believe the movie is excellent. The DVD arrived two days earlier than expected, so the seller gets a solid A, not only for speed of shipment but for speed of receipt. DVD in perfect condition."
negative,"TOO LOOONG: I thought it was time I read this classic. Didn't know until I finished it's 1312 pages! Started out fine. but really bogged down. Dumas kept dragging in so many characters, it was hard to keep them all straight.Part of the problem was that, if I read wiki correctly, it was originally written as a serial - you know, like soap operas that never have a conclusion. There really wasn't a conclusion, in my mind, to this book.Bought free from Amazon and downloaded to my BlackBerry and read a chapter a day for 3 months. Since I always have my phone with me, could read it while waiting for a plane or on a plane at home and abroad or in a line etc."
positive,Great Disposable Nipples: I used these in the hospital when my baby was born and they are great!Now I have them in my baby bag along with the formula bottles and I always have a clean nipple when we are out. I recommend them.
negative,700+ pages of buncombe: i accidently entered the same review twice. I guess there's is no delete button.
negative,"Boring, not scary: This movie is extremely boring. It is not scary at all. I haven't seen House on Haunted Hill but it can't possibly be as bad as this. Don't get it."
positive,Really good!: It was very exciting and definitely a good read. The movie could've been better though. :(I would recommend this to pretty strong readers.
negative,"2 stars for what I was able to stay awake through........: Ok, this isnt fair. Roger Ebert and that other dude loved this so naturally I gave it a try. Jeez people, do NOT try to watch this if you are the least bit tired. I was lost after the first 10 minutes. I feel that I am a fairly intelligent person too so I just don't get it. All I have to say people is at least rent this sucker before you buy it. I was 2 steps from buying it and I would've been crushed if I had. So so so so hard to follow and keep up with!"
negative,"My 6 year old hates this: I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, and when she heard it burp and fart she couldn't belive it. She said she wants to take it back because it's so grose."
positive,"Fun toy: At first, Jenna wasn't really interested in this toy. Now, at 7 months, she can't get enough!! SHe loves the music and stares at the water sloshing around inside. She will reach in sitting and will try to crawl towards it when on her belly (she doesn't get far, but manages to swipe at it to have it make noise!!)It also has a volume control for those early mornings when you're not in the mood for loud baby toys!!"
negative,"Scratches, chips easily!: Bought this seat at Home Depot about 6 months ago. Love the style but unfortunately the seat became chipped. Tried to ""paint"" the chips, but to no avail. It looked horrible. After purchasing a few wood toilet seats by Bemis and having them each chip easily -- I'll now try a plastic seat."
negative,"worthless phone: Speakerphone part works alright. If you get the handset to work you have to be right on top of the base unit, sometimes even then it will not work. The phone hangs up on you when trying to connect. You have to push the talk button four or five times just to try to get a line out. If a connection is made it is full of static. My rating would be a Negative 10 if they had that type of rating. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!"
positive,"good !: Didn't realize what games I would be getting with Namco other than ms.pac man, I was hoping there would be mappy lol but game came as expected."
negative,"you get what you pay for. zzzzzz....: CD's with binaural beat technology are a great tool to use in meditation. That being said, not all CD's are the same. ""Dr."" Jeffrey Thompson flaunts his chiropractic degree in the title of his albums, but his background does not lend much skill to his abilities as either a neurologist or music composer. I have both ""Awakened Mind"" and ""Gamma Meditation."" Basically, both of the CD's I purchased from this group are nothing but an endless and monotonous series of tones that cannot hold the attention long enough to acheive the desired affect. I did, however, listen to each album a minimum of five times to give them a fair trial... the effect was minimal compared to other CD's in my collection. Putting one to sleep is not the same as putting one in a meditative state! One extra star, however, for assisting me nicely in meditation while under the influence of alcohol...good listening for drunks?"
positive,"Instructions are lousy! Item is good.: After spending 75 minutes futzing with this (including burning through all the lock-ties they sent with it,) I finally got it attached and, I think, functioning.Trying to give directions in many multiple languages? Not such a good idea on a single sheet (imagine reading fine print from a map.)Not giving a quick start guide or a Things to be aware of guide? Not such a good idea.Really really small diagrams? Not such a good idea.Hopefully the unit will function better than the installation instructions did.Edit: Updated after I used the device for a year...Yes, it was hooked up correctly...device works fine...still on the same batteries after a year (only ride a couple times a week though, YMMV.)Updated to 4 stars..."
negative,Don't bother...: What a waste! Can't even see the correct answers when you push the buttons...My kids haven't touched! Go for the twist and shout instead...They loved that one!
positive,"My childhood favorite: The Hobbit is my favorite book from my childhood. I remember falling in love with it when I first read it, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I like to reread the wonderful book now and again as an adult, particularly around Holiday season."
negative,"I liked it at first: It was a pretty good camera until it stopped working. One day I turned it on and it started beeping and flasshing an eject tape message. But you couldn't eject the tape and the camera would not respond to anything. I had the camera just over two years when this happened. Luckily I purchased an extended warranty at Best Buy. Best Buy sent the camera to Canon for repair. Canon would not repair it because it would be too expensive so, Best Buy gave me a new camera. And I was allowed to get a different brand, so I went with a Sony Handycam."
negative,awful: this was one of the most boring books i have ever read. i finished reading the book because i had to ( i was going to have a test on it). i still failed the test b/c i hated the book so much. i could not get into the novel and the characters just bored me to death. there was no point and i dont see what is so great about the novel
negative,"Easy install, but be careful it works with your vehicle: The Hopkins taillight converter kit arrived quickly, and was easy to install if you have basic understanding of wiring. The provided tester was cheap, but got the job done. The quality of the product seemed fine given the inexpensive price point.However, be careful to make sure it works with your vehicle. After installing I used the tester in the plug to check the left and right indicators and the running light -- all worked fine. But when hooking it up to the trailer, the running light worked, but the indicators would blink once then shut off. After doing a bit more digging, it seems I needed a powered converter."
positive,"Helped me keep my old garage door working: I had a renter lose both of the garage door openers from my rental house. Fortunately, after a little searching, I found that this one would work. I bought three, and hopefully, I'll have many more years of happy garage door openings and closings!"
negative,"Snake Oil: The Digital Media Reader may work well with Windows 98,Me or 2000, but it failed miserably with XP. To add insult to injury when the SimpleTech web site was queried; mis-information was the best they could give.During the hardware installation, the media reader(UCS-200) did not pass the Windows Logo Testing. I immediately aborted the process. I went to the Simpletech web site for advice. SimpleTech had a section just for XP and stated,"" just ignore Windows's warning and complete the setup process"".What a mistake I made, my operating system was degraded and became unstable. Until I'm able to recover from this misfortune, my computer shuts down whenever and frequent.The news of bad and mis-leading service will spread exponentially from person to person. I hope that this is the exception and not the rule for SimpleTech.Because of wrong information from the SimpleTech web site, I can not recommend a SimpleTech Product in the future."
negative,Again it never ends.: They've come up with titles again and again with the final nightmare or the final chapter or the final friday. It never ends. Our grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren will be watching the 45th nightmare on elm street along with halloween and friday the 13th it will never end. They tried to mask how many they made by taking away the numbers and just putting in a name. Nice try it didn't work. I love horror movies and Freddy's my hero but making the other 6 just movies and making this 1 real life is dumb. Next it'll be Wes Craven's 2nd New Nightmare. Getting Nancy a son was a good idea considering the plot was gettin old but Freddy Kruger a TV character. Come On. If something's fine why change it. The nightmare on elm street's are great so why tamper with it. Still though next time they make one the movie better not be a movie
positive,"its a phone, and it does its job: you were expecting more? i dunno about those people living in cowtowns having trouble. no complaints here. yet, at least."
negative,"gillette fusion power: I recently purchased the gillette fusion power cartriages on amazon although they were sent by a private source to my home. These blades were not or near store bought quality,after trying several blades i gave up it was like shaving with sandpaper. the product was pachaged properly, and sealed and did not appear to be knockoffs, i dont know what the problem was but they were not the same as sore bought.I have e-mailed procter and gamble and they acknowleged my e-mail and will get back to me"
positive,Enchanting and Creative: I wasn't sure if this was a novel for preteens at first glance. But upon finishing it did surpass my expectations. Of course I do love almost all fiction novels. Any book that's can get lost in.
positive,"I love it !!: This toy is the best!! Like I heard before it is a great conversation starter at parties , and my family loves it!! It can even guess things like air, ocean, lip stick, dimond ring , and hand!! I would definetly recommend this toy to kids!! It can also get very addicting and you are always telling your self ""It couldn't possibly guess this one"", and "" Just one more""! You have to have a very accurate answer when it comes to questions , or it might guess something else though!!! Over all this toy is great for both parents , and kids , and I definetly recommend it!!"
positive,"THIS is the one to buy.: I've actually seen the authors live and read their other works, including ""The New Intimacy"" (another great book for couples). Their writing is creative, spot-on, funny, and amazingly insightful. Engaged couples are blessed to have this practical and soulfull guide as a trusty ally in starting off right. Worth every penny. Get it to the next stressed-out groom and bride you know."
negative,"Pales in comparison to ""Born Free"": This is the quite dreadful sequel to ""Born Free."" It is intended for viewing by children, but even young ones will be bored with the extremely slow pace of this feature-length film. Were it shortened by two-thirds to about 30 minutes, it would be reasonably entertaining for younger kids. The acting is cheesy and very dated, and the plot plods along very slowly. There's nothing inherently wrong with the story, and the videography of the lions is quite charming, but it is presented so badly in this film that I would not waste a penny on it. Fortunately, I obtained my copy from the local library."
negative,"Junk: I had this thing for 1 day before the plastic receptacle came apart. It also sharpened pencils off-center, leaving wood up one side. Waste of money!"
negative,"Uber Aweful! No Flavor Here...: When you read the (Klassic 3 Seed) ingredients, you can't dispute that this cracker is probably healthy.... but only if you can get it down. This has got to be one of the hardest, tasteless things I've ever eaten. I even tried this with different spreads. Eating healthy does not mean you have to sacrafice taste. I don't know who wrote the first couple of reviews but I'm convinced they must be associated with the manufacturer. Do yourself a favor... keep shopping. There are many other good tasting and good for you things out there to spend your money on. Hope my honestly helped."
positive,"Captain Bolitho: I purchased many of these novels by Kent in Australia in 1986 but didn't have them all, so I ordered this one to help complete my set. As usual with Alexander Kent and this series it was a delight. Will want to order other novels to complete my set."
negative,"Useless: This guide is only useful if you're planning to visit the Iran of 2000 years ago. Practical information is non-existant, hardly any reasonable hotels are mentioned and there are few if any travel details. Unlike most Bradt guides it's written for scholars and archeologists and not travellers who need detailed information about this complex country."
positive,"The best memory for the 60's: I really love this film, it is my weekend homeworks when I was under 12."
positive,"Fun, well directed Batman film: What a great cast... Christian Bale, Tom Wilkinson, Cilian Murphy, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and the greatest living actor today... Gary Oldman. What more could you ask for?This movie introduces the beginning of Batman, as well as introduce two new villains from the Batman live-action franchise - Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul. It has a wonderful mix of comedy, drama, and action, as well as a very nice ending. Gotham never looked as beautifully depicted as Nolan has done. You won't be disappointed with this movie."
negative,"False facts and over-emotionalism detract from the story.: Charles Pellegrino, while providing interesting insight into the finding of the sunken liner Titanic, obviously neglected to do his research on that which haunts him so. As a member of the Titanic Historical Society and a general Titanic enthusiast, I know much about the dreaded night of April 14th 1912 - in both fact and myth. Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic. This book had the potential to create a fascinating discourse between the two main events in the life of the liner, both academically and emotionally, but unfortunately it doesn't. Luckily we now have James Cameron's film ""Titanic"" to build what Pellegrino couldn't."
negative,"oh well: Well yea sure its supposed to be this wonderfull, amazing, groundbreaking platform game. Well its not, all thats changed are the graphics, besides the general opening there is almost no development storywise, and tecnically speaking all that revolutionary platform actoin can be had in games the like of the Rayman titles, or Ratchet and Clank. All in all it probably would be pretty fun and thus you should add one or two stars if your new to this kind of thing, or add a few stars if you really really really like large environments or just platforming in general."
negative,"Amazing Film, but...: This film is amazing. However, don't buy it if you want an english dub. Despite the claim in the product description, there is no dub on this copy."
positive,"Not my typical book, but enjoyed it: I heard about the book while hiking at Seven Falls near Colorado Springs. HHJ was suppose to have gone to the overlook there to write, including parts of Ramona. This intrigued me and so I checked it out. I don't read much non-fiction, so I enjoyed the idea of a history based novel. It was enough of a love story for me to earn points with female friends, but enough of an adventure to keep me interested. One part of the book that I found distracting was the attempt at phonetic spelling of the Tennessee drawl of a few characters. I had the hardest time reading that, which perhaps is an excellent way of HHJ to capture the difficulty of listening to it."
positive,"Multi platinum CD!!!!!: I love every song on this CD. It's an exceptional change from the nasty, derogatory music being churned out by the cookie cutter pop stars. Clay Aiken breaks the mold and amazes the mold maker. He delivers to the heart. Each song touches you on a very human level. True to himself, this is Clay."
negative,"Sub-Par: The title track and Penny Lane are OK. Everything else is mediocre - The Fool on Hill, Blue Jay Way, Flying, etc. don't exactly make a 5 star album. And the reviewer who compared this to Pink Floyd is off base. Very little done by the Beatles is of the quality of Pink Floyd's work.People who rate this 5 stars are just biased Beatle fans."
positive,"Really good.: When I bought this anime, I thought that is would be good but not excellent. After I finished watching it, I realized that this was one of the better animes that I have watched in a while. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that it was only like an hour long and it would have been a lot better if they spread this anme out into 2 hours instead. I hope that they come out wth a sequel!"
positive,"Brilliantly Funny: I loved this movie from the opening credits to the very end. I can't believe how badly the Americanized version of this is. Actually, yes I can. Why can't people just leave a perfect movie alone?"
positive,"No other name upon which humankind may be saved: It used to be typical for the majority of Evangelical Christians to insist that the true Jesus (2 Cor. 11:4) was the only way to God, as all other ways fell short. John 14:6 used to have meaning to the church. However, in recent years, the meaning about the exclusivity of Jesus have blurred, as many have turned to pluralism or, at best, inclusivisim (Jesus can be found innately in other faiths).In this book, James Edwards deals with the issue head on. Indeed, he holds to the conservative position that a true relationship with Christ is vital to one's standing before God. In the last chapters, he hits Postmodernism head on and also talks about what to do with other monotheistic faiths such as Judaism. His conclusion? We should continue to preach the gospel to everyone who does not have a personal relationship with Christ. I, for one, am glad to see this scholar hold such a view, and think the book is worth a look."
negative,"Unbelievable!!!: I ordered the Sybex book because it was the first out, I returned it soon after. It is useless for the Server+ exam. Sybex really missed the point with this book not only is the coverage of Server+ objectives weak but the mindboggling anecdotes are simply unnecessary. Having said that, I have had success with other Sybex titles and this one is the only one I have ever returned. My advice is to not open the CD that comes with the book so you can return it."
positive,"The best series of books out there: This book is if not the best then it's up there in the top five, along with the other 3 she has written. The story of a young women struggling to grow up and live in a world that doesn't accept her can be related to each of us and will be a book you remember for the rest of your life. The writing is fantastic and you are swept away into a world of prehistoric man that you won't want to come back from. The only problem is when you finish all 4 of her books you are on edge waiting for her to finish the next one. Earth's Children should be the set of books every person has and you will reread it many a time."
positive,"Good video, not as cheesy as people say: I was very happy with this DVD set (and in fact just ordered the breastfeeding DVD from the same instructor). I watched it in lieu of attending childbirth classes and do not regret that decision. I had read several books about labor and delivery, etc., and can't say that the video really contained a lot of new information but it brought the information together nicely and made me feel more prepared overall. I also appreciated the fact that the instructor did not spend a lot of time on breathing techniques and did not overly emphasize natural childbirth. Instead, she discussed the desirability of postponing medications until the labor is well underway because of the cascade effect of interventions (which seems sensible to me). But she certainly didn't try to push going natural all the way. As for the humor, it's not anywhere near as bad as some other reviews have made it out to be."
positive,"Batman Begins Anew!: This is the best superhero movie ever made, and I have seen them all.Batman makes Spiderman look like a total loser.This and Batman (1989) are the only movies of batman worth seeing. The Joel Schumacher renditions are utter CRAP!As Christian Bale said when getting an award for his role in Batman Begins ""It is great that Chris [Nolan] has finally brounght back some DIGNITY to the greatest superhero of all time..."" That is a semi-quotation of what he said, you get the idea.This movies is totally amazing, I can't wait to see ""The dark Knight"", whcih began filming this month (March), and will be out next year.I have no doubt it will be amazing, just as this film is.BUY IT!"
negative,"Not a fun read: I can see this is an unpopular but not unique opinion, but this is one of the very few books I've stopped reading halfway through. And I have no intention of ever finishing it. Despite the fact that I horde books, I gave this one away.While the prose was beautiful, the story tended toward the dull and was difficult to follow. The fact that there were only a handful of names reused by dozens of characters did not help much. Most of the characters were unlikable and hard to relate to. After awhile I decided I just didn't care anymore.Is this book a masterpiece? Perhaps it is, but that doesn't mean it's a good read."
positive,"What a treasure!: Oh my god!! I am SO in love with this book. Josephine Tey, where have you been all my life?!? I'm so glad I have now discovered this author (she published under the pseudonym of Gordon Daviot as well). I totally ate this book up. Yum!! Oh, Richard III, I'm so glad I got this chance to learn so much about you. Shame on Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More for maligning him all these years. This was just such a treasure, I was so thoroughly hooked. I loved the way the characters were written, and I was in great suspense while reading this book (even though my friend felt that the ""suspense"" part would only really apply if you were British royalty, I still cared immensely)"
positive,"Tommyknockers Part 2, with ZEST: This books has some of the Maine elements but we are not all that wierd. There is darkness in rural Maine. But comapare these folks to Elise, the Maine heroine in Defenders of the Holy Grail. Elise surmounts her Maine situation, even her hunter husband. Well, King is a treasure, yes. This work is well done. King makes you afraid of the woods. To explore the other side of Maine, read Ken Agori's novel. Agori leaves you reflecting on the mysteries of the cross and true love. Both are excellent."
negative,book was missing appx 50 pages: I recieved the book and appx half way through reading it I found that around 50 pages were missing! evidently a factory mistake so evidently a factory second someone got on the cheap then passed it on to me!
negative,"fun when it works: This is definitially not as fun as the original 1990 one with removable teeth, and its lungeing motion. This version is smaller than a softball. I really expected it to be the size of the gator golf like mine was growing up.the flaw im finding in this is with the spring they use to make it shut. often the mouth only shuts half way, or and sometime syou have to open and shut the mouth 3+ times to get all the teeth up. Now it worked perfect for about 15 min. My daughter is 3, and she has already gotten annoyed with it becuase of the number of times weve played it and known it was supseod to bite us, but it didnt. I have ordered the original one off ebay since its no longer avaliable new, but will keep this as its a good solution for the car when watching dvd's get boreing."
negative,"Not Fusion Proglide manual cartridges: This Gillette Fusion (manual) cartridge currently appears in search results for Gillette Fusion Proglide (manual) cartridge.While it indeed *is* a Gillette product, it's sub par when compared to the Fusion ProGlide manual cartridge."
negative,"Did not charge my G4 unless the laptop was closed!: Short and simple: This charger did not charge my laptop's battery unless the computer was either off or at least in standby mode with the lid closed.It could keep the computer operating while plugged in, but it wouldn't charge my battery. I've seen other reviews with different results, but for me, this thing was pretty much useless."
negative,"why so expensive?: Wayyyy too expensive for what it is...in this day and age of moderate priced movies, this one just out-priced itself...too bad really...good movie!"
positive,Yay: I love this movie and I was very glad to finally find it somewhere after searching for it for so long.
negative,"What Junk!: If I could give this book zero stars I would.Atoms and molecules, including water, don't know what planet they are on. They follow the laws of physics, not the whims of our emotions."
positive,"Very Comfortable: The bed is nice and soft and double thick. The auto pump is easy to use and works pretty well with new batteries. The vacuum drain does ok but when down to the base have to help it by rolling it at the end. Folding it isn't to hard and package size isn't to big so easy to store. Bed lines fit ok on it but get good one so they squeeze tight so they hang on. But for the money is a great buy I shopped around a lot target, walmart, dicks, Meijer, sears, kmart, ect. So very good buy if you want one for camping or a guest bed."
positive,"The King sits on his 70's Throne and I LOVE IT!!!: I've always LOVED this LP and it is one of my All Time Favorites! Lots of Great Soul Music: In The Name, Green Power (MUST HEAR), Dancing In The Street. Some Solid Rockers: Title Track, Midnight Special. Plus a couple of Richard's Over The Top Monologues: Joy To The World (++MUST HEAR++)and Born On a Bayou. In addition, ther is a couple nifty covers: The Way You Do The Things You Do, Brown Sugar, and the magnificent - I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry -. I just think this album is FUN. ""King Of Rock and Roll"" gets alot of medicore/negative reviews and I think folks just miss the boat... Would I start my LR Collection here? No. Is it over-produced? Yes. Does it at time sound ""cartoony""? Yes, but if you dig the wild/crazy Little Richard of the 70's - you will eat this album up!!!"
positive,"My favorite childhood book: Does anyone need to know what The Hobbit is about? If you have a kid in third grade, you MUST buy them this book (paperback, though, cause I wouldn't trust them to haul around an e-reader). Every kid deserves to have The Hobbit as part of their childhood."
positive,Liz has just got it!!!: WOW!!! Liz keeps you rockin' with guitar licks and a great voice. The only thing better than seeing her perform in person is rockin' along with her in your car. GOOO LIZ!!!!
positive,good value: have ordered close to half a dozen sets of these and used them for gifts for kids over the last couple of years. the set i have for myself has held up good with the exception of the fry pans which seem to get scratched when someone uses a metal utensil. the value for the set really makes it a exceptional buy
negative,"POOR QUALITY!: I bought this to replace my old vhs copy, it was as bad as my old copy it looked like they took an old vhs and copied it.DON'T BUY IT"
negative,"A Disastrous Sequel: A disastrous sequel to Chinatown--- it's hard to believe that the same screenwriter wrote both movies. While Jack Nicholson does a credible job directing, the screenplay is a convoluted mess. This movie was justifiably panned when it came out."
negative,"This book was very boring.: RSR was a book so much filled with techno jibberish I had to stuff it away on my bookshelf of bad books. When I pick it up twenty-five years from now, it may seem a little more realistic, but not now. This is one of the worst ""Clancy"" books I've ever read. Please Mr. Clancy, next time you think of a WW3 type of book, make it so it can be easily understood."
negative,"Easy Rice: I am very happy that I purchased this rice cooker.It is easy to use ,brainless- just add water,rice and forget about. It is extremely convenient and makes excellent rice. Guests have asked how we cooked the rice because it was perfect."
negative,"Do not purchase this game!: Let me give you some advice that will keep you from pulling your hair straight out of your scalp... stay away from this game. Don't take just my word for it... alot of folks here feel the same way. Do not listen to those that tell you that all this game needs is a killer machine to run. Believe me, I have a good machine and the controls are still awful! You get tired of yelling at Lara, telling here to get her butt up them stairs! People around you will think your nuts for screaming at the screen. Laura has never looked better, that is true. The graphics on this game are amazing. It's sure nice to look at, that is for sure. But, even if had a ghost of a chance of making Laura go were you wante her to go, you'd still have to deal with bugs, freezes, Laura walking on air, and attrocious angels. Do yourself a favor... stay away."
positive,"Oh my gosh....: This books is very very awesome.Miranda is a supposed good-goody, and when she's told to ""lighten up,"" she does so. She takes drugs, throws outrageous parties and gets drunk.When a very vlose friend of hers dies at one of her parties, she's guilt tricken and wants to committ suicide.Does she do it? Read and find out.It's an amazing book that a person should read."
negative,"Do Not Buy This Edition: Please do not buy this new edition of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The publishers have completely replaced the original dark, beautiful and terrifying artwork for pictures that are clean, kid friendly and safe. They have destroyed what made this collection truly special."
negative,Disappointing: I was really disappointed in this book and surprised that so many people think it is a wonderful story. It was such a depressing story and reflects all of the worst things about the way women were treated in that time. I don't think this story had any redeeming qualities and very few likeable characters (even Tess was quite irritating at times with her pride getting in the way of asking for help to make her life a little easier).
positive,"Enthralling: I have been in love with this book (and the entire series) since I started reading it when I was eleven, five years ago. Ayla is the ultimate heroine, yet she is totally human, real, and touchable. Auel's extensive research allows her to paint a stunning picture of prehistoric earth. Her characters fit this picture perfectly to tell the amazing story of one young girls life. Malinda Brow"
negative,"This book has DRM: I am afraid that, as much as I love the book, I do not appreciate the limitations put upon this particular edition (Kindle) by way of DRM. How much of a problem DRM is, may vary from user to user, but I would have appreciated it if Amazon had informed me about it in advance of my purchase, as I would then have chosen a different edition (hardcover) where I OWN the book and not merely LEASE it."
negative,"Child Complainted of Bump Sticking Into Her Back: I purchased this for my youngest granddaughter who outgrew the other seat I had. I wanted a five point unit that would work with just a seatbelt as I do not have shoulder straps in the back of the car. (I would have prefered the Fisher Price 20/60 five point unit but they stopped making it.)She fit in the seat with the straps in the upper slots. Unfortunately, there is a lump about an inch below the upper slots in the middle of the seat where one of the latching straps is attached to the rear of the seat. She felt this through a light winter coat. I had to put padding between the seat and the seat cover to prevent the bump from bothering her.If a child is smaller enough for you to use the lower strap holes they probably won't feel the lump as it will be between their shoulders and their neck. However, if they are large enough to require the use of the upper strap holes they will have the lump pressing against their spine."
positive,"1924-P Silver Peace Dollar: I purchased this coin for my Mother as a birthday present because it is the year she was born.It is exactly as described on the bid sheet, and I am well pleased."
positive,"Excellent Product: This Motorola product is perfect. This cigarette lighter charger is as advertised, priced very low and is everything I expected."
positive,Woohoo this book was good!: hehehe...I was reading this book one day and I really enjoyed it by the time I was done with it. I was reading it for school and it introduced me into the world of Ray Bradbury. I would recommend this book to anyone looking into a quick but fun read. This book took me about 4 hours MAX. Its better than the Martian Chronicles but not as good as the illustrated man
negative,"The Good News is You Don't Have to Buy This: Save yourself the agony of wasting money on discontinued garbage. There is a reason B & D discontinued this, and I suspect it's because it never performed well and many users complained. Learn from the poor rating you see here on Amazon. Sure, it has an inverter and you can power AC adapter stuff, theoretically. In practice, your money would be better spent on a sealed, rechargeable, 12V battery and a small cig lighter inverter with USB power outlet, available in the Auto section of Wal Mart and many department stores. That way, you can use the inverter w/USB in your car also and even charge the small 12V battery with a cig-lighter charger."
negative,"Spend your money elsewhere.: I thought this would be just the ticket for my 6 year old crafter. Wrong! I spent 15 minutes trying different angles, pressures, speeds, nothing helped. Still popped out looking like I tore it out of the paper. Stylus button must be pushed hard and long to do anything. Must be used under adult supervision as the point could be very dangerous. It is a very fine metal point that could just as easily perforate skin. Both of my daughters tried it. The six year old spent about 10 minutes, with me assisting her every other minute because she got so frustrated with it trying to get it to work ""right"". She is no longer interested in using it. My 14 year old tried it, had the same problems that I did. She is no longer interested. I would give this item ZERO stars if I could. I doubt this item will be on the market very long!"
positive,"Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Hiking Boot: Delivery time was excellent. The comments others have made about the boot running narrow are correct. I ordered a wide but while the boot fits ok it does feel tight in the width. The first couple of times I wore it on short hikes it was comfortable, but on a 3 hour hike it rubbed off the skin on the side of my left heel. Also, the boots have a very stiff sole. However, walking in wet snow the boot remained perfectly dry. I'm new to hiking so perhaps this is normal, but the boot leaves something to be desired as far as foot comfort goes."
positive,"Still my favorite tale: This novel has been around for a long time and still excites me. I have read it many times and even though I know the complete story, I always find something I had forgotten about. Then it's an ""Oh, Yeah!!"" moment. Never get tired of a classic."
negative,"Stooges are Great, BUT, this Sucks: Don't waste your money and time on this garbage. If you want the Stooges go for the volume collections that are currently out. You will be receiving value for your buck and the opportunity to relive or perhaps meet the genius of this comedy group. For us baby-boomers it brings back fond memories of the silver screen and watching these get replayed on the little screen in our home."
positive,"A TOUCHING TRIBUTE TO HIS FATHER: I've only listened to this recording twice so far. I like it a lot, but I don't think two listenings gives me the right to make stone-etched pronouncements. Go to the NPR website and listen to the 9/17/05 interview with Neil Young and you'll get an idea what this recording is about. His father had a terminal disease; Neil had planned to take his dad on a trip back to their family homestead in Manitoba before he passed. These songs were written with those thoughts and plans in mind. The album was recorded before they were to leave. Sadly, Neil's dad died before they could do the trip. The album is dedicated ""For Daddy"". It's just a peaceful, easy-going, tribute. Neil also had some serious health issues while recording. But what a way to be remembered by one's son. A Golden. Glorious. Memorial."
negative,"Luc Besson didn't understand God in this movie: He has ever had passion to explore some aspects of women, but now he's a ""grown up"". I don't want to see Englishmen, Americans and French themselves playing French in a movie describing history facts, we can not find THE REASON France fought with England when those emotions has been confused a lot. Though I like Milla Jovovich, always. About French's madness, if you are interested in it's beauty and mystery (in this movie, it is expressed little and not so completely), I recommend ""Beatrice"" and ""the ninth gate""(but I've ever seen few French movies). Notice how those people betray God; the ways are funny sometimes and beautiful sometimes, though are cruel (cruelty is based on despair) the same time, of course. I don't know how successful the two movies are, in trying to touch the thought of God, since I myself do not really understand God and find it is hard to understand a little more; at least I am sure they are closer than this one."
positive,"Both my daughter and son enjoyed this book.: It's not overly long, and it's written in simple enough language that my 8 and 9 year old children had no trouble reading it.It's a very engaging, sweet story, which introduces the concepts of chivalry and bravery. I actually think this book is very good for boys to read - it's about knights and fighting for one's honor, and demonstrating loyalty, but it's also about being able to cry when you need to, and being able to express love for others.In this story, the little boy's nanny is moving away, because he's growing up and doesn't need her, and he has some trouble accepting this. I think it's a wonderful, simple way to address some of the issues all children face when approaching their teenage years.I definitely recommend this one to parents and children."
positive,"Ninetendogs Great Fun For Everyone!: I purchased this game for my 8 year old granddaughter. Much to my delight, the whole family loves it! It is very detailed and holds the interest of young and old alike. Thanks for a great family oriented game."
negative,Little women: I think this book is a touching story of a mother and her kids trying to live happy romance and more. Mother got what she wanted a grand child and even though they never became rich they were rich in love affection and happiness.
negative,"It only hampers your website development: This book is so tedious and hard to follow. I don't know why the author made simple HTML codes seem so difficult. It was tolerable at first since I knew some HTML already, but then when I got to the advanced part (such as Javascript), it was impossible to grasp the concept. I was so frustrated."
negative,"Not very impressive...: Anecdotal stories without much true insight, and CERTAINLY not the level that some of these reviewers claim. I continue to get the impression that some people suffer from being overly enamoured with the author or the concept of T4A, and thus lose sight of the fact that this book is really a lot of fluffy stuff wrapped around four lines of text. Honestly, the Four Agreements are wonderful points to live by, and I do every day. However, it seems quite bizarre to me that one would need this book (or any other) to explain what these four simple sentences mean:1) Speak your thoughts clearly2) Don't ASSume3) Don't take things personally4) Do your bestFolks, these are NOT hard things to understand, and you definitely don't need books to figure this stuff out (well, ok, maybe some of you do :-). Do yourself a favor. Print out the four points I've listed above and you'll save yourself lots of money. Peace."
positive,An outstanding series of essays: Though written some time back this collection is an outstanding series of essays on Jewish thinkers.
positive,"Enough good action to go around.......: Good action flick. Again, as in the first film, they give Brendan Fraser too many corny lines. But, he was much better this time around.I will not tell the story other than to say that the bad guy is back along with a bunch of his friends. The action goes from the desert to the streets of London back to the desert... There will be a follow up film later this year to expand on ""The Scorpion King"" that was introduced here. That should be quite good.The special effects are great! The creatures! Wow! The scenery... Wow!The sound went well with the film. I had the volume relatively high. The sub-woofer was really felt during the action sequences."
negative,"Thank you Captains Obvious for the groundbreaking ideas!: The authors try to dress up common sense in a ""parable"" that will make anyone with any sense of the literary cringe. Don't waste your time on this unless you want to study how not to write a book. The writing is awful and the attempts to illustrate what they consider to be deep nuggets of wisdom are laughable. The book is corny in the sense of ""gee-golly-whiz Mr. Manager, duh, why didn't I see that. Boy oh boy, by gompers, you're so wise and I want to be just like you!"" Book summary: If you want to be effective at work, use common sense, be honest but fair in your praises and criticisms, and master some basic social skills. Really? Wow! That's deeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!"
positive,"Awesome!!!: Review Clarification: This review is based on my viewing of this movie in the theater, and on Laser Disc. I have not viewed the DVD (any version).This is my favorite Clint Eastwood movie of all time, better than all the Dirty Harry, Spaghetti Western, and Sci-Fi/Space movies.I first viewed this movie in the theater, and I was completely blown away. I am disappointed that John Malkovich has chosen not to be in more mainstream movies, because I immediately wanted to see everything he was in, after watching this movie. (I immediately rented ""Being John Malkovich"" when it became available, and was quite disappointed when he was not the protagonist.) John plays a brilliant Psycho in this movie, and plays it very well. In fact, I actually changed my image of him after this movie. If I were to see him on the street, this is the only memory I would have of him.I recommend this movie highly. One of my favorites.MC White said: Check it out!!!"
positive,"This CD just flew off the shelves last Christmas and I can see why: My order came in late, January, to be exact--but I'm still listening to Moya's Christmas CD and loving it. Moya's voice is one of the most incredible I've ever heard. If I were to be asked for a suggestion for future CD's, I'd like to hear more in Gaelic."
negative,"Not durable at all...move on to another headset: I had this headset for 3 days. Dropped it from waist level and now it doesn't work. I could have gotten better use out of $30 by purchasing a fairly decent bottle of wine...it would be gone too, but I would have had more enjoyment out of it. This unit is very small, and getting it into the ear is awkward, and is impossible to do without pressing one of the volume up/down buttons, which means you will have to re-adjust. If you have larger hands, like I do, it is a little odd to handle...hence, the greater possibility of it being dropped. The sound was mediocre at best, and everyone I spoke to (in the short 3 days that it did work) said there was an echo on their end. Not recommended. Move on to another."
negative,"the real horror in this horror movie: When I first saw the preveiw for this movie it looked intriguingly scary. But that all changed when I actually saw it. I found it to be very boring. I was actully waiting to get scared. The preveiw for this movie was scarier.Also, the storyline was exceptionally weak and nearly drowned out by way too many special effects.this movie was just another ""tech show""."
negative,"So this is the new doom metal?: Whatever. The only one demonstrating the slightest amount of talent is the singer, who used to be in O.L.D along with bass player Plotkin. They should have stuck to what they knew. The singing/shrieking is best described as excrutiating, but the music has no redeeming features. I've nothing against detuning but detuning this far just makes the guitar sound poorly tuned and badly played. To me it's extreme for extreme's sake, like making it sound plain crap was their primary objective. Mission accomplished, 2/10."
negative,"Kroenke Database Processing uses a 286 chip: I have a difficult time learning from this book. The questions he uses are very difficult to understand and often are misleading.The answer key is missing, so understanding or checking your grasp of the material must wait until officially tested. Which is now too late, the concepts roll into each other. His vocabulary, used to describe a condition, is incredibly vast. So unnecessary. Too many definitions, not enough examples where to use the concepts.Bashes MS and Access to excess. Nothing in the instructions how to find SQL or install it or use it, so you are forced to us Access which when you query, is broken by some of his sample SQL statements.Finally, many examples and conditions are explained along with his terminology which he says no one uses!! But you find this out only AFTER you have read the pages involved. Seems like a waste to explain a concept you should never use or doesn't hold true. And then he tests you on those concepts."
positive,not as good as sahara: No matter what anyone has said SARAHA is the best by this group. I just wish I could find it again. I have looked all over for an old copy for about 4 years now and can't find one if anyone know how to get one please email me.
negative,"Surface Noise!!!!!!: Guys, where are the master tapes? This transfer was taken direct from vinyl. Ze is charging premium prices for this and you can hear surface noise throughout this cd. This wasn't even taken from a particularly clean copy of the vinyl!!!!!"
positive,"Plano Single Pistol Case: This is a very well constructed case for holding anything, i use two for my pistols and one for my camera. The foam is thick, but not crushing the item. The latches are secure and the items stay in place during travel. Also if you look around the edges on the inside of the case there is a space for a o-ring rubber seal to make it waterproof, overall terrific case for the money."
positive,"Damn they go off: Say say these H-town day 2 day grindas all ready got they first album drop 1st round draft picks i suggest you buy this cd if you have never heard swishahouse before. soon other cds droppin from these 2 guys ""who is Mike Jones"" & ""rookie of the year"" from magno. Buy it man"
positive,"Creepy: Wow, what people will do behind jealousy and revenge - there are some doors you should not open, and if you do - be prepared for what you find behind it!"
positive,"better than expected: I read some of the unfavorable reviews, saw the low price and figured it was a dog. I thoroughly enjoyed it, although the cover is totaly misleading. Keeps you guessing to the end."
positive,"So glad Titan Books Reprinted this!!: It is 1888 and vampires are everywhere! From holding elite positions in the government to overwhelming the slums of Whitechapel, vampires have integrated into society. How would the presence of vampires change Victorian, England? This is exactly what Mr. Kim Newman tackles in his thriller novel 'Anno Dracula'. Not only is Newman spot on in his depiction of London in 1888, but he also brings in a wide range of fictional characters from Victorian novels including their authors!Characters Charles Beauregard and Genevieve Dieudonne team up to be an unstoppable duo in search of Jack the Ripper. It is hard to put the book down once you've started reading. So glad Titan Books reprinted this! I hope they continue with the sequel Anno Dracula: The Bloody Red Baron, which takes place in 1918, or I will have to get crafty and find an old copy myself!"
positive,"So helpful!: I was induced with my first baby, which led to a c-section. I was bound and determined to do a VBAC with my second, but didn't want to redo the hospital birth classes. Got these DVDs, watched them once with my husband and several times on my own. Extremely educational, entertaining and helpful. Had a successful, drug-free VBAC and used much of the advice and information DVDs while laboring."
negative,"What a sad sad trip it's been: I have read the other reviews and I've read all of the Earth's Children's books. I was so excited when I heard the book was coming out, but like many others, I have been sorely disappointed. Nothing exciting happens. There could have been great conflict with Jondalar's ex or with Brukeval, but there was nothing!! All we had were Ayla and the ever smiling Jondalar (how could one guy smile so much) and a smart ... One Who is First. She was one of the most irritating characters I've read in a long time. She was pushy and a know-it-all, not the spiritual leader one would think. Ayla has become way too wonder womanish. She does it all, and I guess no one else has ever thought of any of these things! I will read the next book, but it will take a miracle on Auel's part to make me a believer in Earth's Children again."
positive,"You definitely want to buy this CD...: I read the first few reviews on Clay's CD and I think that the CD is really good, because every song on there is good, not just the first three. and that's hard to find. Clay showed a lot of magic on the competition of American Idol in his voice and that was toned down on the album which wasn't so great. The songs on the album are absolutely clean, the only word that Clay uses that's sort of slang is ""baby"" and it's rarely found throughout the album. It's a very family-friendly album and I feel like I can listen to this for years to come."
positive,"Lord of The Flies: Lord of The Flies, by, William Golding is basically based on a childhood fantasy everyone would like to explore.The book mainly revolves around a group of English teenaged boys whos plain crashes on a desserted island.The boys basically have to live and fend for them selves without grown-ups. Scavenging for food,building huts,tools,weapons,and defending themselves against the island monster. All in all if you like the thrill of a hunt and remember the fantasies of living on a deserted island as a kid this book is for you."
positive,"Trés Bien Céline: The new CD by Celine Dion is really good. The French lyrics add a sweet touch to the ear, and each song is exquisite and unique. Tout l'or des hommes is unique in its hard rock theme. Apprends-moi seems a bit too pop ballady. My favorite on the album, Le vol d'un ange, is a emotionally touching and a beautiful-tuned song. Je lui dirai is very funky, and Ne bouge pas is hilarious. Get the CD!"
positive,"seiko#5 snk377k: This is a fine time keeping watch,and nice looking.I received,on time and with all related items box,and papers.A good purchase for any buyer looking for an automatic watch.Ken,C."
negative,Weisz is great but Keanu is miscast and the film is horrible: Really bad horror movie that has only the great performance of Rachel Weisz from keeping it from being a total waste of time. Keanu is miscast to the point of him hurting the film and the script is so horribly written that it literally almost too painful to the ears.Rachel Weisz is great but she's the only good thing about the entire film.
negative,"100 years of boreitude: I can count on one hand the number of books in my life that I have been unable to finish. I am oftimes mocked for my reading, the rate at which I devour books being astronomical, but I could not drag my weary brain kicking and screaming through more than a few dozen pages of this book.I love a good fantasy novel, or anything that gives you a sense of the magical, but I could not find anything interesting in the random and inexplicable bizarre occurrences in this book. Mix that with the dry, long winded prose and I find myself doing something I have NEVER done; sitting with a book in my hands, looking around the room for something else to do."
negative,"Better for baby than mom: For all of the positive reviews on this, I didn't find the Boppy all that great. It didn't support my arms as I held my baby and it was more cumbersome than anything when I was trying to feed him. I don't think I would suggest this to other moms, regular pillows you'd find on your couch or bed are easier to get in place than this thing. About all I'll use it for in the future with other children is for the baby to lie in when they're between 0-3 months in age. The Boppy with toys that hang over it might be a good purchase, but this thing does not work well for breastfeeding."
positive,The Man Has a Voice: Mr. Aiken can sing. Something that seems to be rare with so called pop stars these days. I love that I can listen to this CD and understand the words to every song clearly. The power in his voice is unsurpassed by anyone in recent years. Every song on this CD is great. It would be impossible to pick a favorite. I can't wait for his next release.
positive,"A Quest Every Child Should Take Before Imagination Is Lost.: This is one of the first movies I saw as a child, and the one I most vividly remember. Even though I am all grown up now, fragments of this beautiful film--especially the vision of the lovely Lady Amalthea--have lived in the back of my mind the whole time. Seeing this film again nearly 17 years later was like being swept back in time. When all the lost unicorns are brought back from the sea on the crest of a wave, and when the Last Unicorn, at the end of her quest, returns to the forest she left, and the credits start to roll, and the music plays, and the scenery turns into that medieval tapestry, I was crying like I was 5 again. My only complaint was the picture on the video box. It looks cheap & corny and really doesn't capture the wealth of beauty, fantasy, and imagination that's locked inside."
negative,"Quite possibly, the worst book I've ever read: This was assigned to me in college 25 years ago. I still remember how I struggled to get through the 90 some pages of this book. One reviewer wrote that the point wasn't to tear down men, but to show that women can live without men. She must have missed the part where because me are gone, so are wars. Clearly only men can be greedy/hateful. Women are only nurturing and giving. This book was assigned along with ""The Handmaid's Tale"" by Margaret Atwood. I can't say enough good things about THAT book."
negative,"Good price but...: The price is good, the delivery service is good but the product should really be in capsule. The tablets are much too big to swallow and you have to take about 6 a day to feel the benefits. I have resorted to melting them in cool beverages, but image the taste!!!"
negative,"has the lead singer lost his focus?: I was recently in dallas and visited the gypsy tea room where this band was playing. The band only had one good song and it was only good due to the guitars. the lead singer has a bad voice and at the end of the performance he says to the crowd ""thanks for coming to see me play"". he said this to the 40 people still there. anyway i noticed he had 3 other people on stage that were BAND MEMBERS. I could tell that the drummer was ticked about that comment and was overheard saying""he, the lead singer, has lost his focus"".sad very sad"
negative,"boring: Not at all impressed with this movie. It is misleading to have the halloween title as it has nothing to do with the original movie. Nice try Mr Carpenter, but not a hit with me."
negative,"Vexx fails: Basically, you can say that this game is about 30% fun and 70% Frustrating. The gameplay is uneccesarily difficult at times and ceases to be 'fun' after about 4 levels in. The camera is terrible. Some have said here dismiss it as 'oh well, all platform games have camera problems'. However, this game definately has the lamest camera of them all.Another dissapointment is the fact that there are no milestones. If you [expire], you get to start over. Period. No matter how many lives you have left, how many items you have collected no matter how far into the level you have gotten, they all get erased to zero and you get the distinct pleasure of having wasted your time. Isn't that Fun?Acclaim has definately failed in their foray into platform gaming. Get Ratchet and Clank or Rayman, you will actually enjoy those games. This one looked like it had potential but is just too frustrating. Don't waste your money on this game. It just ain't worth it."
positive,"Very, very good.: Funny, sad, and heart-warming without being corny. The characters and the sometimes borderline surreal-ness of their lives reminded me a bit of ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. If you like Marquez, you'll like this book. Be patient at the beginning though - you won't realize how good it is until after it's over. But the ending felt a bit contrived. Anyway, great stuff."
positive,"Cute Lunchbox: Love the Wild Animals lunchbox. It's more like - zoo animals.It has a good, thick amount of insulation and is free of harmful plastics, etc. It's also a lot roomier than your average lunchbox and I like this because it leaves extra room for more freezer blocks to keep everything very cold. We also send two drinks, one for lunch and one for snacktime and the extra room is great!I agree with others about this being difficult to clean, so we send a paper plate and have the little one eat outside of the lunchbox, so we don't wind up with crumbs, etc inside the interior seams, problem solved.It's also nice to have a lunchbox that not every kid has, so he knows which one is his. This will probably last the entire school year and that's good for a fabric lunchbox. I would buy this again and will get another next year."
negative,"Yet another commercialized disappointment.: Forced dialogue, Poor characterization, and almost no emotional pull renders an otherwise good story into meaningless drivel. The glaze on my eyes didn't clear until after page 150. (Enough time to blink!) It always saddens me when good money is spent on something that is seemingly all hype and no substance."
positive,"An Insider's Look at Relationship Counseling: With humor and insight gained from considerable experience as a practicing marriage therapist, Dr. William Morrow dons his referee shirt or flak jacket as the case may be and leads the reader on a journey across the reefs of marital discord. Morrow begins his collection of essays with an insider's look at the therapist' role. He concedes most folks come to therapy convinced of their own rightness and are waiting for the therapist to discover this and announce the obvious winner. They will first have to endure an episode of active listening. Admitting a bias in favor of marriage and the sustained relationship, Morrow, who is an ordained minister as well as a therapist, urges his clients to bring openness and courage to the therapy. Viewing relationship as a solid ship within which one is better prepared for both the joyous and the dire consequences of living, Morrow urges patience and committed listening to all participants."
positive,"Nice, could be bigger: Very nice! Great quality. I was surprised, however that I could actually use a bigger one. Even when I make just one latte, my espresso machine does such an awesome job at creating foam - my milk generally foams up and over the pitcher."
positive,"this title make me his fans,branagh.: in my opinion ,'dead again'is a love story that impress me very mush"
negative,"This movie kinda stunk up the house.: Awe man... Why Anne? She was kinda pretty! Any ways.... so the Robocop name was kinda wasted on this one. Although the robot ninjas were kinda nifty and it was a nice little addition to bring back ED209. I though he was the dopest of all the enemies in Robocop. This title was a little to kiddy for my taste and you can kinda tell from the sudden drop from the usual ""R"" rating in a Robocop movie to the sudden ""pg13"". It wasn't a good move on their part to make it appeal more to children than to adults. It should have been kept a mature film."
positive,"Oscar Peterson Trio at Straford Shakespearan Festival: A great recording. I own the LP. Something happened in remastering to CD, as I don't recall a strange sound on the LP that I hear on the Cd."
positive,great scratcher: My cat never took to the traditionaol scratching post. We have used these for years now and I highly recommend it. Initially the catnip drew her to it---now she just loves when her old board gets replaced with a new one.
positive,"A Keeper: This is one of the best musicals of our day. I do have to admit that Gene Kelly's voice by far overpowers all other Tommys that I've heard. However, I believe this guy truly comes in a close 2nd. The voices are truly delightful and make you feel as if you're right there. I do have to admit i'd just buy this cd for this rendision of ""Waiting for my dearie"""
positive,Excellent Blue Grass Artist/Album: I first heard Dan at a Allison Krauss concert in Branson MO. He is a very talented musician and this is a very good album if you like folk/bluegrass music.
positive,great album: This is a great album and includes the best of EW&F plus some collaborations with other artists and singers from the era.
positive,I never learn how to sew these videos help: These videos are fabulous my daughters and I learned how to sew using only these videos. My daughters have surpassed me in sewing. I thank God for Pam's williness to use her skill to make videos for those who never was taught the skill of sewing. May God bless her business.
negative,"What Happened to Rod Stewart?: I know, I know, he sold out years ago, but I was really surprised that people were reviewing this release. People, the GREAT Rod Stewart (and he was GREAT) left the building years ago, this is another sad cash-grab. Buy some Faces, please, and listen to how fantastic they were, better than even the Stones. After that, Every Picture Tells a Story, Never a Dull Moment; what can you say, the beginning of the end, sure, but magnifigant all the same.Rod Stewart is not the clown he appears to be on his latest recordings; he's an incredible singer, interpreter and thoughtful talent who, I want to believe, has yet another GREAT album in him.Buy and listen to some Faces non-believers, or Jeff Beck Group; you'll understand why Rod deserves his Rep."
negative,"A BOOK OF LIES EVEN A BAPTIST (me) WOULDNT BELIEVE: No, I am not Catholic, but after looking at this book I have realized that it is nothing more that a book full of lies - thousands of items and quotes taken out of context so that they seem to be the truth. This book has been turning devout Christians against their faith for a long time and I think that it is time for that to stop. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO BURN IT. As a Christian we should strive to build each other up no matter what the doctrinal differences are - so this book is a piece of trash."
positive,"GREAT MOVE OF GOD: I LOVE THIS MOVIE ,I'VE WATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND COME AWAY WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT EACH.TIME .WELL MADE,GREAT ACTING!!!"
positive,"back to the old KING: i think this was typical KING before Bag of Bones. the story is eerie, though I will admit a little slow in places but by the middle of the book it really books.I was getting used to the newer KING but I'm pleased with this new book and I think any true STEPHEN KING fan will be too."
negative,Not recommended: I have to agree with most of the reviews here. This saw is a peice of junk. I returned it almost immediatey. What a waste of time! I should have read the reviews here first!
positive,"One of the best: My wife purchased this game for my B-day. So far, I really like the game.I like playing Warcraft, Starcraft, and C&C series. However, I was getting bored of managing resources (e.g. gold, timber, food)I was looking for a game with more strategy rather than resource building.I remember the first time I played Myth and I like the concept of the game. Praetorian is a mixture of Myth and Warcraft. There is less resource managment and more strategy on fighting. Praetorians' graphics, sounds and game play is top notch."
negative,Stay away from this book: I purchased the book and found a great number of errors within. I contacted the primary author who advised me of the web site his company has set up to notify the public of errors within the Exam Cram series that he is involved with. There are so many that he offered to refund the money I spent on this book. He also advised me that the publisher is refusing to make changes in subsequent printings.I would not depend on it primarily for passing the test.
negative,"Did I hear what I think I did?: What the hell? What is it with everyone saying N*****? It does not look good, it's vulgar, and offensive. I hope that artists stop saying it. I don't think that Usher needs to use that word to make good music."
negative,"Simplified Scientific Astrology: I am very disappointed in this book because there is no interactive contents. I mean, come on - this is an astrological work tool. I need to be able to go through and index different aspects at different times. I don't doubt that the information is extremely insightful and very helpful (I have a hard copy of this book that I can no longer read due to eye problems) but it is almost worthless to me as it is. The only readon I gave it two stars is because of the wonderful content."
positive,"Pat and Mike: Pat and Mike is a lovely story of a star athlete, played by Katharine Hepburn, who is discovered by a sport's manager, Spencer Tracy. Hepburn's character realizes that she is going to be watched every minute of every day while in training. This companionship between athlete and manager finally turns to love.In Pat and Mike, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy again play opposite each other. Hepburn also gets to show off the skills in sports and physical agility, which she posesses in real life."
positive,"Plug and Go Go Go!!: No fuss, no muss. Just plug it in the PCI slot and reboot. Windows XP installed it automatically and I was up and running.It could not have been easier unless someone else did it for me...."
negative,DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALL: do not buy this product go somewhere else i got mine today and its horrible i wasted money on a stupid bootleg version go to another site or something the bootleg version in the picture it the one you get im writing this so nobody else wastes there money and time for nothing
negative,"Really Wanted To Like This, But.............................: OK, it sounded like an interesting novel. I love well written historical novels, and hey thei one won the National Book Award! My only question to that is...WHY? It is passably OK. Mildely interesting story, laconic pacing, settings thathave been desceibed better by even the likes of John Jakes (isn't that sad, since I did NOT like his latest effort either). I keep reading, waiting for something to happen and I have so far beenr disappointed (and I am nearly finished). All I can say is I am glad I took this one out of the library first, otherwise I would have felt ripped off. Sorry, but awards do not a good book make. Two stars for effort and some nicely crafted language, otherwise find something else to read and don't waste your time on on this one."
negative,Bad Business: I am a soldier who is currently deployed overseas and i have ordered this product twice from amazon and have never recieved either one of them and would never use amazon again.
positive,"STUPENDOUS: Pearl Jam has struck gold. When i first listened to this cd, i thought,""this is great!."" This cd is powered by ""insignificance"" (top 3 best ever by pj) and ""nothing as it seems"" (great slow song). But the good songs do not stop there, there are the soft/hard ballads ""thin air"", and ""light years"" which are wonderful. Starting off the cd is ""breakerfall"", which is pretty heavy and rocking. ""breakerfall"" is close to the same heaviness as number 3 ""evacuation."" (just as great). The Cd finishes out with ""parting ways"", a soft and great song. The others arent as great but its hard to match 7 great songs. The others arent terrible, just arent as good. Buy this cd as soon as you can."
positive,Best movie ever for those of us who grew up in the 60's: I grew up in the 60's. Everyone wanted to get married and have babies. Then we grew up and figured it was a mistake until we realized what a best friend we had in our husbands and wives.
negative,"If you like Crichton, do NOT read this book.: In this series of autobiographical essays, Crichton comes off as self-absorbed, selfish, emotionally immature and alarmingly credulous about paranormal phenomena. If you enjoy Crichton, give this book a wide berth; it will reveal your hero's feet of clay"
negative,"Horrible, horrible, horrible: Not even Megan Followes could carry this off. It totally departs from the story and the heart of the originals. I couldn't even finish it because it was so bad. There was still plenty of material the writers could have drawn from, so I have no idea why they just made stuff up rather than draw from L. M. Montgomery's work. It was banal, boring, and for someone who really loves Anne, a travesty.Only get this movie if you know nothing about Anne of Green Gables or L. M. Montgomery. Other than the fact that the characters are named Gilbert Blythe and Anne Shirley and that they occasionally and briefly visit a place called Avonlea, you would never recognize this movie as having anything to do with the originals. That is because it doesn't."
positive,A timeless CD: I love this CD! I could listen to it time and time again. His music always inspires my creative muse.
negative,"the hotel you dont want to stay at: This review is for anyone who, like me saw the trailer and said to them selves ""wow that looks like a really cool detective movie"", well its not a detective movie, Mel Gibson is in it as a detective this much is true but his character take a black seat in this picture, wandering in and out of the story line at his will. The real story is about is about two of the crazy people that are staying at this hotel flirting with each other.Milla Jovovich plays her underwritten part well with lots of subtel moments I'm sure people wont pick up on straight away,...Tom Tom character is mentally retarded so its really hard to work out his reasonings and motivation...."
negative,"Sunny Side Up: I had to read this book for a Business course. Larsson meanders through the chapters, dropping and picking up points like a stream-of-concience dictation. While his Pro-globalization points are good, he disregards the arguments against globalization as if they are irrelevant. The point of the book could be made in about half the pages, especially if Larsson would leave politial bashing out.If you want to explore the issues of globalization to make your own decision on whether you agree with it or not, choose something else, or supplement this book heavily. It's a little boring, but may be useful once you have the background on globalization.If you have a background in business, don't waste your time with this book. The arguments are based almost soley on Macro and Microeconomics 101 priciples.If you are looking for fuel to support your Free-Trade fire, this book will provide you with many supportive case studies. You have my blessing to read this book."
positive,"A truly beautiful recording, very personal and deep: A lot of people hate this album. I guess is because is of the softer more retrospective style. For me this album is great, far better than Paralles. As a painter and graphic artist is one of the albums a use to get in the mood to paint and create. You can find here some of the most personal and beautiful of the band's songs like, Pale fire, Shelter Me, and Island in the Stream. Plus you get one of Fates's most awesome progressive tracks- Monument. Overall an excellent production."
negative,".: not a kindle fan. downloaded because it was free. didnt redownload the app on my new phone and anyways, this was all mised up, pages not in order."
positive,"IMMORTAL!!...: Immortal is so good. I bought this album today, and this is after my opinion a little better than ""Battles in the north"". I've actually just have ""Sons of norhern darkness"", ""Battles In the north"", and ""At the heart of winter"", but i'm getting Diaboilical and Pure Holocaust this christmas.... I think SOND is the best immortal cd i have right now, but if u like to get chills and get cold over u'r body, this is the cd for you!!!"
negative,"Do NOT Waste Your Time Or Money!: Before buying this book I came to Amazon and read a bunch of reviews. While many of them were negative, I figured, ""I like all books."" Wow. I should have listened to those other reviewers. If Ms. Powell had stuck to the memoirs of her cooking, it would have been great. Instead, she sticks the cooking bits in between unneccessary political commentary, complaining about her job, snarking at her husband, and general awfulness. She is so unlikeable, that I am considering not finishing the book. I have only done that twice before, usually I just slog through. If you haven't bought this book yet, don't. Listen to the reviews, and wait for the movie if you must experience it."
positive,"Not Just For Babies: When my first son was born a friend gave us the predecessor to this aquarium. She said it was a ""MUST HAVE"" and she was right. He slept with it and played with it for over two years. Then we passed it on to our 2nd son (now 28 months). It is finally dying - from 4 yrs of constant use. My younger son still turns it on every night and falls asleep to it. We aren't ready to give up the peace this toy has given us. So we are now buying the new ""Ocean WOnders Aquarium"". This product is NOT just for infants."
positive,"Almost perfect, minor setbacks.: I got this case for my husband about 3 weeks ago and it has worked great! The case has a good bit of padding all around which makes it very protective. We didn't use the clip included because he prefers to have it in his pocket so I don't know how the clip actually works.The only setbacks to this product is that he has to take the case out to charge it on his iphone dock we have because the case is too thick for this, but I'm sure that if you have different accessories it may not be an issue for you. Next setback is the fact that the edges on the front of the case make it a bit hard to reach the keys at the edge when typing.But I am willing to sacrifice a little bit (very little) of easiness in order to avoid accidents!I am definitely recommending this product!"
positive,"Fantastic Collection: What a fantastic collection of books this is! This collection has some of Lewis' best theology as well as some fantastic fiction. My personal favorite is ""The Screwtape Letters"" which really makes you think as Lewis explores the way a demon may think. Lewis is one of the greatest minds of his time and arguably one of the best fantasy writers ever. I recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys reading quality lit."
negative,Lord of the Flies by Andy Lemmons: The book Lork of the Flies was an ok book. To me I thought there was too many stories going on at the same time and there was to many charcters that the author talked about. Yet it had good adventures I was not really thrilled about this book. If you are looking for an adventure type or survival book then this book is a good book for you.
positive,"Nice, energetic and inspirational cd.: I was very excited to get this cd and I was not dissappointed. Clay is a wonderful singer with a big clear voice with a very good range. What I liked most about this cd is that the songs deliver good messages and no dirt. I would say that this album is a mix of pop rock and inspirational. Some of my favorite songs would be:Invisible- fun, upbeat, and good lyric about not being noticed by the person you are attracted to.The Way- Wonderful, romantic and I expect that it will be played at a number of dances and proms.I Will Carry You- reminds me of the songs Bridge Over Troubled Waters and He's Not Heavy, He's My Brother with its moving and inspirational message.This is the Night- another romantic song that gives me the tingles.Measure of a Man- This song could easily fit in a gospel/inspirational album. Fabulous message in it.This cd makes me go back and forth between dancing and getting teary eyed. I bet you will feel the same way."
negative,"If you are Young Enough: Maybe if you are young enough and shallow enough you may find this entertaining. However, if you have ever had to attend the funeral of a loved one you will probably find this very tasteless."
positive,sennheiset PXC 300: Good headphones in nice hardcover box. Useful in office with AC or in airplane ( airplane adapters included)
negative,"Classics never die!: If your looking for a different version of the classic ""Moby Dick"" then fine. Personally I thought it fell short of the mark. The only highlight for me was when Gregory Peck made his apperance as the preacher. The original is still the one and only."
positive,"Works like a charm: This rack is easy to put on, fits in the trunk perfectly when I'm not using it, it's sturdy and putting the bikes on and fastening them is very quick.Great product, I'm happy I bought it."
negative,Mario and Luigi on the big screen..not so good: putting Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as the plumber brothers Mario and Luigi. Samantha Mathis is Princess Peach and Dennis Hopper is the boring King Bowser. some good moments here and there but whats the deal yo. the games are better then this monstrousity. damnit...they should of made a cartoon version. Leguizamo and Hoskins are ok as the brothers but wow.....not good and the Yoshi dinosaur is idiotic
negative,"VERY DISAPPOINTING!: First of all this movie in no way goes by the other books of Anne Shirley. I read every book and the movie goes no where near it! Second, there really isn't any comforting aspect of this movie except in the end.Thirdly if you're going to make another movie of Anne please go by the books. Gilbert in no way goes into WWI, it was their son and it was disappointing to see none of their children they were to have in the movie. She has about 6 children. Come on. What happened. I'm a big Anne Shirley fan but I just couldn't take the way they took liberties with the story. Lucy Maud Montgomery would roll in her grave watching this movie!"
positive,"Works as advertised: Needed this amp to run a set of outdoor speakers. The directions were concise and clear about the few features it has, including the line 1 vs. line 2 input/override which was a complaint early on it appears. I'm running this amp with a set of relatively efficient speakers ~89db/40wrms and it has no problems providing the power to these speakers. I've yet to really crank it up but will do that once everything breaks in a little bit.Would have given 4.5 our of 5 if I could because of the popping on shutdown (I just turn the volume knob all the way down first)."
positive,Made very well considering the cost: The dress was very well made I can not complain about that at all. I knew it was not going to fit when I purchased it based on previous reviews so I expected alterations. But with the money you save the 30 dollars to adjust is nothing.
positive,"Read this Book!: Absolute genius! Professor Kunich takes a look at all the nonsense swirling around human cloning, and rips the mask off of it. With brilliant clarity and insight, this book exposes the many fallacies riddling the anti-cloning movement. Most important of all, Kunich's book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that if the government bans cloning, some of our most precious civil liberties may be next. This is a book for the ages, but especially our age."
negative,"Definitely NOT haiku - poetry? Maybe...: This is indeed a book of 3-line poems passing itself off as haiku. This is not harmful certainly UNLESS an unwary reader picks it up and assumes that it is, basing all future opinions of this delightful poetic form on The Haiku Year.""There are those who regard haiku as a kind of 'do your own thing' poem, and never consider its foundations. But the haiku, as soon as it goes beyond the beginner's efforts, becomes a matter incorporating traditions and established values, aesthetic and otherwise, and can not be written well outside them."" - Robert Spiess"
positive,"Fine novel, but it's too short: Fahrenheit 451, is a fine novel. It belongs to the kind of sci-fi, which is really imbued with meaning and consequence. Thus I would group it with other great, litterary accepted, sci-fi novels, like ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" or ""Brave New World"". I was quite surprised about the abrupt ending of the novel. I think it's too short. It's kind of like a novella. While reading I was thinking whether there is an allusion to the tremendous fear or reds and the communists during the 50's in the U.S.?"
positive,"An opus of dimensions and immortal peronalities.: William's Streetcar is without question a masterpiece; the tale of the haggard Blanche's futile search for kindness and her destruction at the hands of the barbaric Stanely speaks directly to the mind of any reader. It is a work that brings us to a deeper understanding of ourselves: what we think of Blanche's character, Stanely's nature and Stella's metamorphosis speaks directly to our own character and ideals. William's view that Blanche, for all her errors, retains her dignity and her concept of a ""lady"", never deliberately harming a soul, is an important reminder to us all: we are no one's judge. Streetcar is a story of survivors, of dimensions and of immortal personalities. It can be enjoyed on multiple levels, and is to be recommended to any reader."
positive,Great Read!!!!: Shows how the story of one man can make a difference. Such a good read about the life of a slave. Something alien to a lot of people. The book draws you in from the start you wont want to put it down.
negative,"The worse.: Dull, loud and boring adaptation of the classic horror comic book lacks a real leading man for the movie to fly with its bad script and almost as bad special effects. While Keanu fails miserably in his role, his co-star Rachel Weisz does more for this movie than the movie does for her, giving her character a real sense of grace and strong will despite the lousy dialog, badly written characters and insane plot clichés that is surrounding her during the course of the movie. Weisz's performance alone is worth the price of the movie ticket but other than her, there is really no reason rush to see the bad film.My Suggestion? Wait for DVD."
negative,Didnt understand it: What's so romantic about this movie.The comedy in the movie was exceptable when you got the joke.Didnt like it at all.Sorry Babs
negative,"Big Clay fan- unfortunately not of the album: I love Clay's voice and I bought this album and I will buy the next. I think this album is overproduced and all the songs sound the same. I hope Clay's next album brings more personal meaning to his songs, and let's his voice come through more. I'm still a huge fan, I think his producers missed the mark unfortunately."
positive,"A wonderful tale!: This is a magnificent book. It details the horrors of war and the inhumane conditions POWs were forced to face, but it also is a carefully crafted tale of friendship, and how people can thrive in the most unlikely places. I disagree with the reviewer who thinks it is a depressing book - it is a novel of the human spirit, with a dash of good old capitalism thrown in for good measure.Again, it is a wonderful book. It will stay with you for a long time."
negative,"It's so hard to tell how something will fit by a picture.: But One Size Fits All just isn't the case with this hat. While it does fit on my head, with the strap adjusting to the correct length, the hat does not pull down nearly as far as any of the other hats I own.I wanted a blank hat, that would go with anything, but this hat does not fit down to the top of your ears, where I think you'd want it to (it comes up about 1 inch short or more). So your head will definitely be cold in the winter, and you will definitely feel like you're wearing a yamaka, and not a baseball cap.I don't just think it's that I have a big head, I think this hat is just made differently than you'd expect."
negative,"Can you hear me now...Can you hear me now?: The averall construction is good but the placement of the holes leave a lot to be desired. It changes position very easily and constantly covers the, already way too small, holes you speak into. I would have been very dissapointed if I would have paid the original asking price of $... The belt clip feature is good."
positive,"Fun Way to Pass an Afternoon: I thought this movie was super cute. Some of the plot points were a little fuzzy, but as far as romantic comedies go, it was fun. Gabrielle Anwar is great, and Sean Astin was pretty fun. I didn't realize that one of the guys is Smith from Sex and the City, so that made it even better! ;)"
negative,"Not Funny: Billy Connolly: Live in New York is a poor recording of his comedic talent both artistically and professionally. The stage set looks drab and poorly lit, much like an amateur would do on his first chance of recording finger puppets for a kindergarten class. The comedian's appearance matches that of the set, leaving his grey hair standing out as if he just stepped out of the shower. His comedy material seems impromptu, with digressions that never establishes ""The Roll"" in any of his comedy bits, stories or subjects, throughout his comedy act. To be frank, I fell asleep 3/4 of the way through the DVD and decided to use the DVD as a beverage coaster instead.I originally purchased the DVD based upon samples of his material I've heard from Satellite Radio, and I believe that there are far better recordings of this artist besides this DVD title."
negative,"A porno flick with a beat: Folks, if you know what the crew are about, don't bother. These are essentially uncensored versions of their crude videos that appeared on ""Yo MTV Raps"" in the late 80s-early 90s. Pulchritude and raw sexism with a beat. The Japan section of the video referrs to a clip of a pornographic act on stage during a concert in Japan. Need I say more? There you have it."
negative,good for adults: had to read this for school and found it very boring. unless you like things being dragged out then do not read this. good plot but overly explanitive.
negative,"DON'T BUY IT!: Ever since I bought this and charged my ibook with it, my ibook hasn't worked! Don't buy it."
negative,"To sum it up: Let me help you out and save you some money. The router is a tool with a device that spins real fast and can remove wood. That's what I got from the book.Actually, in all fairness, the author did cover the differences between plunge routers and fix-based routers very well. The book also addresses the popular routers on the market though it seems likely that Porter-Cable may be subjectively promoted a bit much. Additionally, the photography was well done.As far as being a complete guide, it is not. I am particularly interested in learning the ends and outs of router usage and gained no insight here. Even when the book did resort to technique, the author used terminology not applicable to beginners and then did not bother to enlighten readers with an explanation nor with a glossary of definitions. In fact the book reminded me somewhat of old college texts where the author was more interested in impressing his own contemporaries than imparting knowledge on the unknowing."
positive,"Just as expected: What a refreshing break from the majority of today's popular music! I also like the fact that women and girls of all ages are drawn to Clay. It's a nice album by a nice kid. The songs are not phenomenal, but I'm sure in time Clay will be able to choose better material to showcase his talent."
positive,"Barhaiya! Really excellent: This is a fantastic resource. I have just received my copy and already I am in love with it. It is very well-written, and strikes a nice balance between the structure of the langauge and usability. I especially like that the author is no fan of prescriptivists, and so presents ""Hindi as she is spoke"". I would not say that it is ""better"" than Snell's TYH, but it takes a slightly different approach, and is, in my opinion a great complement to the other work.My only gripes are the way that all the devanagari is stuck at the back (grr!) and that I had to buy the book and CD separately. Even with those minuses, it is absolutely worth it, and I would rate it a must have."
negative,"Where's the flower?: What the heck is that? The package finally arrived, but the flower was missing.. end of storyI got 2 peaces of plastic and a piece of metal for 10 bucks (shipping incl).. could be worse..But, seriously?!?.."
positive,"multilayered and intriguing: This is the best album I have heard in years! It has a beautiful melancholy quality, but it is also very spiritual and uplifting. I would recommend it to anyone. I am a graphic artist, and I truly believe it has helped my work to listen to this fabulous album."
negative,"This should not be listed on Amazon: This was a gigando rip-off! It does not even contain the ""The Owl and the Pussycat,"" which from the ad I expected to be included. The table of contents is a joke - listing the page numbers of each of the numbered limericks, which could have been written by almost any college freshman after 3 beers at the local bar. There was no attempt at editing, and often a limeick with one line at the bottom of one page would be continued at the top of the next.This is a book which Amazon should be ashamed to list and should be obliged to refund all of the money paid by each person taken in by the listing."
positive,"great story, terrible ending: Reading the other reviews you know how the story goes. The base of the story is outstanding and hypes up the ending to be something great, but the ending is average at best. It's kind of like a great boxing match ending with a tie."
positive,"Entertaining and informative: Unlike other reviewers, I didn't mind the ""fictional characters"" that were introduced into this movie. The facts were still there and the movie was entertaining and informative. A well done presentation with an all star cast that works well together. Some of the acting by these veteran stars is not as good as I would expect, but the movie was still worth purchasing just to learn a little more about this decisive WWII naval/air battle."
positive,"Lord of the Flies: Not only is this book expertly written with an intriguing story line, it also contains vivid imagery and symbolism throughout. The book represents the very animalistic qualities of human nature and the settings in which it can be brought about. The novel is full of subtle symbolism, from Piggy's glasses, to the fire itself, and has an adventurous plot that is sure to keep the pages turning. The books central ideas and messages are conveyed accuratley and interestingly and do not disappoint. This book is a must read for all and is sure to become a favorite for those who embark on Golding's journey."
negative,"Total Crap and that is Generous: I am sure this movie will appeal to spoiled brats who resent their parents and the establishment in this twisted immorality play. The film was playing when I was in college, and although I thought the poster looked neat, I never saw it. I realize now that it was garbage just like all those ""Billy Jack"" movies and the ""One Tin Soldier"" theme song. I saw the movie on Showtime recently and could not finish watching it. It was the kind of crap that only a liberal intellectual could love. I do own 2001 on Blue-Ray and appreciate that movie."
positive,"Awesome...: The music are the best Classic Music that you can find, Everyday when I go to my job I listen it."
positive,"Great Book: Great book, ends so that you can't wait for the 2nd. THe 2nd and 4th books are good as well. The third book was just OK. Pretty decent series though."
negative,"bad design: The pan steams perfectly, however the design of the handles is bad. You HAVE to both, use two hands and use a pot holder or towel to grab the handles. This is because they get as hot as the pan. The same goes for the handles on the steamer...they get wicked hot. There is no insulation in the handles. Will never buy a pot with similar design again."
positive,Excellent: Great comic to catch up on when you have some free time. I carried mine with me in my work bag and would break it out when I had some free time to read. Worth the purchase.
positive,FANTASTIC!: I CAN SAY THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST CD TO COME OUT IN A WHILE! THEY DEFINATLY DID A TERRIFIC JOB!
negative,Jen: I ordered according to my size. The dress fit great except for the chest area was EXTREMELY to big and there was no way to alter the dress without ruining the style. Couldn't exchange for smaller size as the rest of the dress fit great.
negative,"excellent movie..horrible quality: does anyone know which vender offers the ""best"" copy of this Lizabeth Scott Fem-Fattell movie? It's a great movie as I'm a noir buff who has stuff on Beta, VHS, and DVD... parts are(scenes) are missing so is dialogue....The video quality is abysmal.... HELPPP please!!!!!"
positive,mest is a band to love: if u love catchy up beat punk music then this is the band for you!!! they have a lot to offer and show it on all of their albums. their songs are full of energy and they show it on this album. this is my fav mest album and i recomend it!!!!
negative,"Good if you want free shipping: I only purchased this DVD because I needed an extra dollar on my order to take advantage of the free shipping. Since there is no description of the DVD, I thought I would provide one for others looking for that extra buck they need to spend for the free shipping.This DVD is eight episodes of the three stooges CARTOONS. Judging by the thin cardboard cover, the quality is very poor. Looks like someone sat there with an old camera, took a picture or two of some scenes that were playing on an old color TV, scanned them into a PC, and printed them on a box. I just tossed the DVD out, so I can't tell you if the quality is what I think it is. It's basically something you will see at a dollar store.If you are looking for some three stooges episodes, this aint them. If you need an extra dollar to take advantage of the free shipping, go for it. Who knows, maybe some kids would be interested in it."
negative,"i want my money back: Most likely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! I went to see this movie with about 5 or 6 friends, when it was over, we all wanted our money back! The movie is not funny at all. Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy, there are alot of sad parts in it, but they label it as a comedy. All this movie actually is happens to be is a fairy tale for little kids, huge waste of money. If you want to see a real adam sandler comedy wait for anger management or rent happy gilmore."
negative,"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078: I'm a huge sci-fi fan and I love Jack Palance and Corky Nemec, but this movie was a snooze fest. The question I have for this talented cast is what the hell were you thinking?! Granted the effects are 20 years old, but the dialogue is laughable, it takes much to long to get into, and to be honest, it was just boring. I kept waiting for something to happen and when it did, I really didn't give a damn. Sorry, but this was terrible."
negative,"terrible dvd: I give the show 4 stars.but,the dvd package 1. the second disc skips on 1 show.and,the other shows won't even play. i don't know if writing to universal whoud help or not. i wish there was something that choud be done."
negative,"WHo Said Life ENDS After 80?: When most people over 80 are locked in old age homes, orsitting on a chair 24/7, or layin in bed all day living their final years, In SEXTETTE, Mae West proved that ""Life Doesnt ENDafter 80!"" Although in most parts she looked and walked andtalked like is she was a zombified embalmed corpse, she lookedlike she was enjoying herself. The movie is stupid and silly, butit is amazing to watch Mae in her 80's, with all those heavycostumes strugglin thru her lines. Above all, the movie is just'silly fun'. You'll enjoy it."
negative,"""Takin' Back My Name"" Hardly Ike: In this sad excuse of a memoir Ike Turner tries and tries and tries to convince us that he is a good person. WRONG! Instead he comes off as a psychopathic obsessive fool who ruined the best thing in his life when he destroyed his relationship with the wonderful TINA. He also jumps back and forth with his opinion on TINA but hey who cares? We must remember that HE BEAT HER UP and like the old saying goes ""A leopard cannot change its spots"" or to quote Marlo Thomas on ""Friends"" ""once a cheater always a cheater"" Take that, Ike."
positive,Shoo Goo: We always use this to support shoes that we love. Glad to still find it somewhere. The price is also right
positive,The extra content is wonderful.: I bought this to re-read before going to see the movie. I've always enjoyed this story a little more than The Lord of the Rigns. The added extra media makes this worth gettin if you don't already have the digital version.
negative,"broke the first time: i wouldn't recommend this product. The positive terminal clamp broke in half the first time i used it... I, as I was stranded, rigged up a method to make contact with the terminal w/ the remaining half of the clamp. Then the charger (which was charged fully the previous night) didn't provide enough power to actually turn the engine over. I will be returning to the store tonight, returning this item, and purchasing a different charger."
negative,"Stupid book: and mostly stupid dialogue!people do not then or now deal that way with people,nor do they not have any idea why people might take kids out of school, at that time after ww2.example ""why must I not marry..."" ""how could a girl..."""
negative,"Poor Agatha, poor reader....: I've read every book in the series as well as the H. MacBeth series.I haven't finished this title yet but agree with other reviewers regarding the lack of proofreading. I was even stymied as to why this book would be listed under ""Women-detectives-England-NORFOLK and not Glous. or Warwickshire.""A.R. and the Love From Hell is a bit darker than the others in the A.R. series and so far (up to p. 172) there is no humor at all."
positive,"Yes!: Simply awesome. Had me pumping my fist in the air and yelling, ""Yes!"" over and over again. I read this in one marthon session of fist-pumping and yelling."
negative,"Senial Crap: As I have thoroughly enjoyed pretty much all of the music by the Rolling Stones, I was excited to listen to their most recent addition to their famed collection.However, I found that it was a complete let down. While some of the songs share the upbeat bounce and rhythm I enjoy, most songs and especially lyrics are absolute rubbish. They sound horrible. When will they learn that not everyone facing senialty should still be making records. Leave it to Sinatra boys!"
positive,"One of the Best: I am a big fan of Ann Rinaldi, and I definatly think this is one of her best. It is a great book to curl up with, and once you start reading, it's hard to stop. Is is about a young girl who is confused and frightened after the assination of Abraham Lincoln. The story is very intriguing and, as with most of her books, a small and not overdone love story is taking place between two of the characters. It is worth reading, whether you buy it or not."
positive,Great Book: One of the best and most interesting books I have ever read. I highly recommend it to anyone.
positive,Smallville: I've got all of the Smaville seasons and have enjoyed them all. I'm disappointed that the show is ending. I like the characters and the plots.
negative,"Anno dracula: Story is disjointed and so at times difficult to follow. Character development and story line predictable. Reference to other real and fictional characters over- done, but an interesting idea."
positive,"One of my favorites: Its been awhile since I have been impressed with an anime storyline. Usually its the visuals that have grab me first. Biohunter did both. I was really impressed with the storyline, the visuals, and how well everything just flowed and above all kept my attention. I really like the idea of one of the creators being torn between his human self and his dark other half and how it was in his nature to try and save his friends from the ""virus"". Is there a Biohunter 2??"
positive,"well it works: the bouncer looks and works like it says... the only problem is that my son hates it! he screams the minute hes put in there, but is happy to be bounced on my knee for what seems like 23 hours a day. i probably will sell it to someone because for me, it just takes up room!"
positive,"Suprised by the high quality.: I bought this just because it was cheap and was not expecting much. This is a very WELL-MADE mouse. Getting used to it was not hard at all, despite what others say. Just make sure you calibrate the Pistol Mouse in windows, to move 'slower' than a normal mouse and it offers fine control. Nothing beats this and the Nostromo N52 for first person shooters."
positive,Harvest time board game: My daughter is still a little young for this game which I did not realize when I bought it. But I have played this with other children and it is fun.
positive,"A First Class Read and An Excellent Gift: ...especially for any grandparent who went through World War 2. The first book was very good, but hearing these stories in first person was even better. It's hard to think what the world would be like without these heroic people!"
positive,"Helps keep away colds!: A great value for the price (I buy by the case). In winter and cold season, when I'm around people with coughs and colds, I constantly keep one of these cough suppressants in my mouth to coat my throat and by doing so don't allow the germs to take hold. They taste good and they're sugar-free. They work!"
positive,"Great read: Wonderful book, love living in the smokies and reading about the tales from the past. Would recommend to anyone interested in most beautiful place in the country"
negative,DO NOT BOTHER: This is toy so frustrating. Very hard to put together and even harder to get the working parts to work without the entire thing falling apart! My son loves batman and this was a gift from his Grammy so he is using it but I had to mount is to a special board to keep from falling into pieces and then tape it together! By next week it will find the dumpster. Waste of time and money and worse yet truly frustrating for my 5 year old..
positive,"Great pan and great whisk: I bought this primarily for the whisk, I REALLY needed a nylon whisk. The pan and whisk are great. It heats evently, I love it. It did not come with a lid which was a little disappointing. For the money, they could have included a lid."
negative,"Not for an Outback Wagon: I've seen this on trunklids, with bikes or without: appears sturdy and appropriate. Fine.As for use at the back of a wagon, specifically an Outback, it simply doesn't fit. The side straps don't grab at a good angle because of the interior plastic connected to the hatch. The top straps can't get an easy grab on the metal (even with recommended $20 extra) without bending and threatening to break the back-up light assembly which are positioned above the rear glass.If you have an Outback, go for a roof rack solution, or spend the $ on a trailer hitch, I suppose."
positive,"Riveting, Kinky Romance...: I started watching it because I always enjoy Robert Downey Jr.'s performances. In this film he does disappoint, once again... But, Nicole Kidman shines also...This is a dark film, quite literally, and a quiet one. Downey, as Lionel, hardly speaks above a whisper and his soft, sinister voice greatly adds to the movie's suspense. His soulful eyes are arresting. Kidman's repressed and shy housewife of the 1950s comes across as realistic, and yet, strangely like the troubled princess in a bazaar fairy tale. (""Beauty & The Beast"")I positively loved this intelligent, sensitive, but, kinky romance. WONDERFUL!!!"
positive,"The final chapter of Jean de Florette: Originally titled ""Manon des sources"", this movie is the conclusion to the store ""Jean de Florette"". It is done in French dialogue & English subtitles.The camera captures the beauty of the French countryside in all its splendour in this movie.Jeans' daughter Manon, has grown up and taken over the family farm, following the tragedy which occurs in the first installment.She seeks to extract revenge on those who have harmed her family.There are some amazing revelations in the movie, which will leave you shocked.A truly wonderful movie, well acted, directed and filmed.It is important to watch the first installment (JdF), before viewing this movie."
positive,"One of the best albums ever made. Garbage Rocks !: Truly the best album I've ever listen to. The first time I heard it I fell in love with it. I love Shirley's voice, its sultry and seductive, and she really rocks. All the tracks are great! Go out and buy it! Its definitely worth it."
positive,"back cover reads:: Now for every man, every woman the new quick and easy way to effective speaking opens a modern speedway to skilled communication fro everyday use. here are just some of the situations where the book will be of help.Winning a group of skeptics to your viewpointteaching a method of explaining a subjectoffering an idea in a community meetingconvincing a purchasing agent that your product is bestconversing with a new acquaintanceselling a big ideaaddressing a meeting important to your careerpersuading a group to take actionaccepting an awardmaking conversation with a group of strangers"
positive,It is all I had hoped for and more: I was hoping that the pan would be as good as it looked and it was
positive,Great movie!: Under the Tuscan Sun was such an enjoyable movie.Diane Lane is just great in the starring role.
positive,Must have album: This album is a must have for all fans of Kenny Rogers. There are some fabulous ballads on it especially Buy Me A Rose.
negative,"very poor writing, poor storyline: I read this w/ high anticipation but both the outlandish storyline and the unusually poor authorship made it a vast disappointment."
negative,"I couldn't get into it: I just coulAfter getting more than 50% through the book, I had to stop ... I just couldn't get into it and didn't like the writting style."
negative,"unreal... but it could happen: I found this a not so well developed story fantastic, pretty cruel and exaggerated.. Unrealistic because of the details and how they are presented, but it's main crime could happen!"
positive,"Yield, America!: Long you have resisted to Kylie, longer than anyone else on the Planet, but the rocking Krafterwerkish ""La, la, la, la"" will sneak behind you and get into your head. It's shall indeed make all the world move. It just must, it is so damn good. Enjoy Kylie, she's back to make Americans unable to get her out of their heads!!!"
positive,"Very good album..: The album is very solid. 'The Anthem' is an ill song (as you can tell from the list of artists on it). But what really made me glad to get this album is the freestlye that Canibus laid down, that whole freestyle was ill. Pick this joint up."
negative,"Sophomoric At Best: There isn't enough worthwhile substance to rescue this amateurish attempt at filmmaking. The intriguing, if somewhat cliche, storyline does little to disguise the blemishes and flaws in this movie. The major downfalls are the awkward and choppy scriptwriting and directing.In general, the character progression is unbelievable, exhibiting little to no natural transition from emotion to emotion during pivotal scenes. On the other hand, the acting is decent, but also suffers from the poor writing and direction. As the product of this, you end up with a movie that you don't want to watch but you want to know what happens at the end.I would NOT recommend this film unless you have an affinity for bad southern gothics or a vested interest in Gale Harold's career.DO NOT watch this movie if you're looking for gay or lesbian characters; it only touches upon gay themes."
negative,"Splatiador: Awful movie! Why did it win best picture? Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was definitey robbed of the Oscar!"
positive,"Post Apocolyptic Action At Its Best: A post-apocolyptic wasteland. Peace officers in hopped-up hotrods. Renegade bikers. What else does a film need to offer to be a five star masterpiece?! One of GIbson's earliest films, Mad Max continues to be one of his greatest achievements, both as a film and as a character. I give this film five big stars! This is a must see film."
negative,"I rate this 0 stars, pity there's no 0 star rating: This is the worst CD I have ever heard! It's absoultely terrible! I can't belive that it's number 11. This woman has no talent! All of the songs sound the same, and the best way to describe her voice is a cat being strangled. Miseducation? Ha, I'd say that."
negative,"Brave attempt: I'm a great fan of the Pink Panther series and a great fan of Alan Arkin. Some reviewers make much of the fact that Arkin doesn't attempt to recreate Sellers character bringing his own take to the film. I, however, believe in not following the formula more closely than he did as created by Sellers in the first two movies, some of Clousseau is also lost. The opening segment of the Inspector disembarking the plane is about as close as the character gets to the one we know so well. Sure, there are flashes of humour throughout but at times you're left questioning whether your watching a comedy or a drama. If you're a die hard fan by all means purchase this for posterity but don't expect it to see the light of day from the shelf too often if at all. As much as it tries to emulate it's predecessors it never quite makes the grade."
negative,"MobySignalsTheEndOfAllLifeOnEarth: This review will never see the light of day, nonetheless it must be written so that hopefully it will have a negative effect on the 4 1/2 star rating Moby's album currently has. Sadly the world is ripe for the likes of Moby. Millions upon millions of mindless, musically impaired twits, who think that DJs like Moby are actually musicians, sing (out of key) the praises of this modern adaptation of The Emperors New Clothes.His album, Play, is a testament to the depths of human suffering. Surely no man could have more accurately put to disc the sea of emotions present on Play. From boredom to depression, rage (at his inability to create new music) to madness, Moby knows pain like no other man in history.That said, Mobys ""album"" is horrible excrement that epitomizes everything that's wrong with music today. On the other hand if you enjoy repetitious samples and funky drum beats and have an inability to whistle in tune, then Play is right up your alley."
negative,Defective Parts: The parts are defective and not what is shown on package. The round top ring that holds the bag ends up being at a 45 degree angle because the side bars are defective. What is seen on package is not what is in package so the final product is not at all what is advertised.
positive,"great router lift: sofar this router lift has worked great. i like this product, iv used it a couple of times and it has done everything that i needed it to do. i like that here is a router lift for less then $200, its even better thats its under $70. its well made but the only thing i don't like is that there is no way to tell how much you are raising and lowering without using a combination square or ruler. overall this is a great router lift and cant be beat for $70."
negative,"Hopelessly out of date: The Chicago Manual of Style has become the standard for professional writers and publications in many different fields. But this ""1st Edition"" is hopelessly of date. It's okay for historical purposes but so much of the English language and syntax has changed over the years that an up-to-date edition would be much more valuable, even if the price is higher.Russ Heitz[...]"
negative,"Sof'feet Callus kit - bad product: Hi, this is a bad product in my opinion. The best way to do this is to use a glycolic acid product like Glytone 29.5% Ultra Heel and Elbow Cream. This will remove the unwanted dead callused skin much easier and with a better result. Just need to use some care with it's use like everything else but it does a great job much easier."
negative,"Not my style: The book covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters. It is difficult to keep track of who's who when every time you get to know the cast, 200 years suddenly pass and we're in the middle of a new crisis. I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious."
positive,A great classic book: I read this book on a whim after seeing it mentioned in another book. I was not expecting to like it as much as I did.
negative,"depressive: it's kinda ok, but quite depressive. With the way the things are today, I don't really want to read about other people's suicide thoughts. But on the other hand, the book is well written and certainly well researched."
negative,"BORING: I bought this toy for my 6-month old for Christmas last year. She really didn't play with it that much. She is now 17 months old, and to this day this toy has not interested her at all. It is still on the shelf, in perfect condition. I've gotten it out for her periodically, but this toy does not appeal to her."
negative,"long and weird: This movie is very long, and very weird and a little too scary for my 6 year old girl who likes unicorns. It's quite dark and depressing for a kids movie."
positive,"Does what it should do.: Works fine, seems to be as well made as you are going to get in a cheap consumer electronics accessory. Ordered on Friday, arrived on Monday - can't beat that for service."
positive,"A Fourteen Year Old Reader's Review: The author paints a story of two unlikely friends, Lenny who is very much like a child but huge and as strong as a bare and often runs into trouble with out knowing it. Bad tempered but somewhat kind George has to get Lenny out of trouble sometimes losing his job. They both share a dream together of having their own farm and just when it seems close to coming true things go absolutely wrong. I read this book and it left me breathless at the end and touched me deeply because of how it reflected the harsh times then and now and of how society deals with different minded people. The writing is beautiful filled with heavy metaphors. I think if you've read John Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath"" you should read this too, or if you are interested in something heavy and thought provoking or if you want to read a good book that's bin banned before :)"
negative,"Question...: NO one even says IF this series ties in with the Alternate world in which HIS Civil War, Great War and American Empire series do..THAT is what I am MOST curious about...It would be helpful to MANY fans that have JUST begun reading Turtledove..."
negative,"Don't waste your money..: This book is only for the most shy,least confident and the most clueless with women men out there. I'll sum up the book for ya....Don't waste time on scoping for girls that don't make eye contact with you, they're not attracted to you. When you notice that a girl holds her stare and smiles at you or gives you a double look, charge on in for a conversation. Once in make her work for your attention, don't give it away that you're attracted to her. Once you're convinced she's into you, go for the score.....That's it...."
positive,"The One and Only... MS. JACKSON (If you are nasty): This DVD is one of my all time favorite musical DVDs. Miss Jackson proves why she is the highest paid singer in the industry. With a combination of costume changes, great choreography, Janet's greatest hits, and a sold out crowd at Madison Square Garden, the DVD makes for an excellent night of entertainment. I only regret that I was not able to see the concert in person here in my home town due to a cancelation of the concert;however, the DVD is definately a suitable substitute. I highly recommend this DVD to any fans of Janet, lovers of music, and owners of quality DVDs."
positive,"Great sunscreen, needs a better bottle: I love the sunscreen, it feels weightless and doesn't clog the pores. I knew it was good -- I had a sample from my cosmetologist. However, bottle design is very inconvenient. Most high end beauty products either have some sort of a pump inside the bottle or are made of flexible plastic that's easy to squeeze. Pevonia bottle doesn't have a pump, and the plastic is stiff, so I end up getting too much lotion each time I use it."
positive,"Absolutely gorgeous: I've been an Enya fan for years, and this is as fine as anything she's done. Any devotees of Celtic music will love it. In particular, fans of Loreena McKennitt, Secret Garden, Eden's Bridge and Celtic Woman will revel in Enya's lovely vocals and instrumentals."
negative,"Eh...: I don't care for the creator of this film, he seems kind of off-putting and it makes me weary to trust some of his findings. The fact that he snuck the Ouija bored into the hotel room and didn't respect the owners beliefs and rules about having it in the inn bothered me a lot. That being said, he seems almost like a kid in a candy shop, and he seems eager enough to ignore the inn keeper's rules in order to capture evidence, and so a part of me thinks he wouldn't make anything up for that reason. He is am amateur though, and a lot of his evidence reflects that. Its a cheap film, and if you're bored I would suggest renting it, but I wouldn't look too much into it...after all, there is a reason why Ghost Hunters rejected him."
positive,"Wow!: This has got to be one of the best books ever. There is such creativity in this book that while I was reading it I kept asking myself how can a single mind accomplish such a thing. Everyone has to read this book, not only science fiction fans."
negative,"I didn't put it down...: ...but I easily could have. Bleah. Dull and racist. I am not much of a Tom Wolfe fan at this point, having read and been bored by both ""A Man in Full"" and ""Bonfire."" I admit laughing at and being impressed by the vivid characterizations--the prose and powerful description does keep you going, but the plot definitely does not."
positive,Audio problems did not make me not Enjoy the film.: Problem with the audio so be warned. But the Magic of this film is still there. The audio may be a problem for some but I think it is worth it so such a low cost.
negative,"A Travesty: One of the finest Sherlock Holmes short stories, ""Charles Augustus Milverton"" showcases Holmes and Watson at their very best: brave, dashing, and humorous. This Granada adaptation manages to throw out every feature that makes the story great, padding it out with unconvincing background detail and, in one particularly dreadful episode, suggesting that Holmes has actually fallen in love. Designed to give Jeremy Brett an actor's holiday, this little scene is an index to everything that went wrong with this series in its later years -- sentimental, unnecessary, and ludicrously untrue to Conan Doyle."
positive,"A must have: This is a ""must have"" in my opinion. The Ocean Wonders Aquarium was a shower gift. My daughter is almost 4 months old, and she has slept in her crib since she got home from the hospital. Because of the soft, soothing sounds of the Aquarium, she has never been fussy when it is bedtime, and we have been able to establish a ritual very easily. She watches it every night as she drifts off to sleep. My husband and I love watching her look at it as she tries to keep her eyes open. I think that every baby should have this little gadget!"
positive,"Delicious and Addictive: This cereal is great because it tastes so good. You just crave it. But a word of warning: read the label. Last time my husband and I looked, it had saturated fat! All the other cereals in our cabinet did not... hmmmm. Another reviewer noticed this problem too!Also, Amazon's price of $23 is outrageous. It is between $1.99 to $2.50 in our stores."
positive,"Great music...but: How could you not apprecite the music? And, it is the music that matters! Still, I wanted more...more about the story and the history of the times, the conflict, and the context that would extend my understanding of the lyrics. That issue is not a criticism of the wonderful music but a request from the people who design the print material that accompanied the CD."
negative,"Where was the plot?: I thoroughly enjoyed Auel's prior writings and had eagerly looked forward to this novel. I was very disappointed because it was so boring and repetitive. Where was the plot? I kept thinking that Ayla was going to decide to search for her son, Durc or that there would be an encounter with the ""flatheads"" and Ayla would have to act as an interpreter. I wish I could understand why Ms. Auel would tempt her readers with signs that either of these plots would develope but never followed through. I would have given this a two star rating if I hadn't had such high expectations."
positive,"This one is for the KIDS: I saw the trailer for this movie on a rental and couldn't get it out of my mind. When I went to order it, I was pretty leery of purchasing it after reading the reviews. However, considering its cost and potential use in my daycare, I decided to give it a try. The kids LOVE it. This one is NOT for adults. Many of the children I care for love this movie so much their grandparents HAD to purchase it for them to keep in their homes! Do your kids a favor and try it. You have very little to lose!"
negative,"Smallville Season 9 - Faulty disc: Purchased the Smallville Season 9 Blu-ray set from Amazon. When playing disc 4 there is a fault which freezes the picture. While the Season 9 set, up to then was excellent, the faulty disc totally ruined the viewing experience, hence the awarding of a lower than deserved rating."
negative,"Horrible film!: My only reason for seeing this film is because Robert DeNiro is in it. Good 1960's music and good Italian music, but good music doesn't always make a film good. This is a horrible film. Waste of my time."
positive,"Works great, easy to setup: Couldn't be any happier with how this functions, and the setup was as simple as it gets."
negative,W O R S T MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!: THE worst adiuo and bad story line. What'a waste of my hard worth cash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative,"Tons of fun examples, but argument-free: I admired Lutz's throughness in accruing examples, and there are many interesting sidebars and historical illustrations, but there's almost no point to this book at all. It reads somewhat like Marjorie Garber's latest works, except it's even more ""lite""--it's as if he had been so busy finding things to discuss relative to tears that he forgot to spend time actually discussing what sorrow and sentiment and sentimentality actually mean."
positive,"Great!!!.............until the end.: It was a good book. It was great until the end. I thought the end was stupid. With all the government coverups in it, it makes a conspiracy lover go crazy, until the end. I would recommend to read it, but let this be fair warning, the end isn't very good, or at least I don't think it is."
positive,"Very impressive: This is the best scifi novel I have read for a while, goes above and beyond the author's revelation space series. It has real characters, good description of spaceflight in the next few decades, a mystery which really shocked me when revealed (didn't see that coming), plus big ideas and revalations about intelligent life in the universe. Everything fits together perfectly, highly recommended."
negative,kumenhe32: It didn't last as long as I thought and wasn't as sturdy as I would like. I wouldn't recommend this transmitter because the light on the digital setting blew. The end that plugs into the cigarette lighter was not tight. I need something with a little more quality.
positive,"Dreamy Electronica For Those Who Can See Past the Glowsticks and Strobes: Disputeably, Sasha's most controversial album amongst his fans. Airdrawndagger has Sasha exploring the dreamier side of electronica versus pleasing those on the dancefloor. The album is not a true mixed set when condidering Sasha's choice to minimally blend (and sometimes not at all) the featured tracks. Defintely not for the tastes of all, but should be appreciated by fans who support a broader spectrum of electronica and by those that realise it doesn't always have to be about popping a couple of pills and dancing to an uplifting set at some nightclub.4/5 stars."
positive,"A step back in time: I first read the Strangers and Brothers series years ago, and avidly went from one to the next. I vividly remember loving them, the situations, the people, the writing. So, I thought I would read them again, several decades later.I was struck by how very much of a time and place they are, and how the English reticence and manners in the first half of last century shaped the conversations and relationships in the novels.Much is made of a glance, a start, or an averted face.Events unfold in their own pace, and the life and customs living in Cambridge and within a college are detailed and evocative.The Masters is about the succession plans for the leadership in a college when the master is dying, and when he does die, how the decision is made by the fellows. It is decidedly a period piece, but once into it, there is something compelling about the world and the people created by Snow."
positive,"My 18 month old loves this video!: I bought this DVD for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. When I ask if she'd like to watch the Elmo movie she starts dancing around and giggling. Her favorite part is Snuffy singing ""On Top of Spaghetti"" and when the meatball falls off the plate she throws her hands in the air and yells, ""oh no!"" And then she starts ""sneezing"". She does loose interest somewhere in the middle but it provides me with a great distraction for her while I make dinner."
negative,"Bad...: ...really quite staggeringly, breathtakingly bad - unless you're particularly fond of big explosions, that is, in which case you'll absolutely love it. If you don't, prepare for a totally ridiculous tale woodenly acted without much conviction. Not even Robert Patrick's nasty chief villain can save this monumental turkey. It has but one good moment, when a minor baddie, seeing the chasing ex-Marine, says, ""He's like a Terminator"", and gets an annoyed glance from Patrick, who played the liquid metal Terminator in ""Terminator II""."
negative,"This Review Is For CD ROM Only NOT THE BOOK: The CD-Rom is very disappointing. The graphics look like early 90's graphics, the font has no ability to be adjusted to a larger size, and the sentences are all bunched together making it difficult to read. It's as if they just scanned the W3 into a software format and decided to sell it with absolutely no modifications. The developers should take a hint from Encarta's Dictionary format. And all this for $49.95. Oh, and if you've got Webster's Collegiate Ed. installed, (on Windows XP) you cannot install the W3 alongside of it (I wanted to do this to compare definitions). It's either one or the other.Some additional improvements would be a pronunciation guide (the kind that you click on the word and it pronounces the word out loud), as well as a feature to hide archaic or obsolete definitions of a word."
negative,"Sent Two Back: I purchased this player and it worked fine with movies, but was incapable of playing a music CD all the way through without pauses, glitches and other problems. I wound up sending the first back, got another and had to send IT back due to the same problems playing audio CD's (store-bought.) I also found the Audiovox info-helpline impossible to access either by phone or internet. Too bad, because it played movies just fine."
positive,"A few more chances: If life could be that way, we were all having a few chances to make things right."
positive,"Good: What can you say about cables, either they work or they dont't. This cable funtioned as expected and the quality was good. A good deal at the price."
positive,"Great Value: I purchased this recorder after reading the reviews about it. I haven't played the recorder since childhood, and it came back like riding a bike. This instrument is easy to play and sounds incredible once you master your breath control.I wear L/XL gloves and my hands fit this recorder easily. Condensation build up can be maintained with proper breath control, its plastic so build up will happen regardless. This is well worth the money, you won't be disappointed if you purchase this recorder."
positive,GIVE THE GIRL HER PROPS: I KNOW ALOT OF YOU HATE MADONNA JUST BECAUSE SHE IS MADONNA. I HAVE BEEN A LIFE LONG FAN AND EVEN I WAS KINDA IFEY ABOUT HER DOING THIS BUT THIS IS A LADY MADE OF SHEER DETERMINATION TO DO THINGS RIGHT. SHE WORKED LIKE A MAD WOMEN TO GET HER VOICE IN CHECK AND SHE DID A GREAT JOB. SHE HAS NEVER SOUNDED BETTER. SHE HITS NOTES ON THIS SOUNDTRACK THAT I NEVER COULD IMAGINE HER DOING. NO SHE ISNT BROADWAY TRAINED LIKE THE ORIGINAL STAGE VETS BUT SHE DOES A FANTASTIC JOB. I LUV THE ORIGINAL ASWELL BUT SHE DOES ADD A CERTAIN EMOTION THAT WAS MISSING FROM PATTI AND JULIES PERFORMANCES. SHE EVEN WAS TRAINED BY PATTI LUPONES VOICE TEACHER. SO YOU HATERS JUST OPEN YOUR MINDS A LITTLE AND GET PASS THE POP ICON THING. THE GIRL DOES HAVE TALENT.
negative,"Wrong/Misleading info?: Perhaps i don't know much about books, but the description of the book is wrong as it states 1973 when in fact is much more recent than that."
negative,"your life...: do you realize how dangerous it is for u to sell this book Know one is going to by it because of its history and the very well known fact that NO ONE WHO HAS THIS BOOK IS SUPPOSESED TO TALK ABOUT IT LIT ALONE SELL IT..SO PEOPLE WILL FIRST ASSUME IT IS WITH OUT A DOUBT FAKE,AND THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL PEOPLE BELIVE U ARE A CRAZED MEMBER OF THE FREEMASONS AND OR TRYING MAKE A PROFIT ON THERE SCARED BOOK OF DOGMA AND RITULS WHICH IS STRICLY FORRBIDDEN AS I HAVE ALREADY STATED DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND TAKE IT DOWN.....Be Well.............."
negative,"It is all untruths...lies!: I was there for two years, there are very few if any real facts in this movie, on the Extras Disc the advisers and statisticians did not tell the truth...The movie is a lie!"
negative,"Very disappointed!: I bought the Ocean Wonders Aquarium because it looked very cute and I hoped it would be a bit better than the Peaceful Planet Aquarium. My son used the PP Aquarium for almost 2 years and loved it. The only reason we aren't using it now is the motor seems to be going and is getting loud.If it weren't for the loud pump noise for the bubbles, I would keep this item. However, I'm also disappointed that the volume control doesn't go lower than it does and that the unit doesn't stay on longer. I've tried using it for my 7 month old but she has no interest in it and it's too loud to soothe her to sleep. This will be returned."
negative,Ugh: I read four chapters and put the book up for sale without finishing it. Why do some of these romance writers think it endears us to their heroes and heroines for them to be dumber than dirt? And why do they think it's funny to repeat the same thing over and over and over?Ugh. I got rid of Bradley...and Cruisie as an author I'll pick up and read.
positive,"Terrific book: I loved this book! The photographs are powerful, and you can't find anything even close to their documentary quality anywhere else. The text is also interesting and includes quotes from a variety of people--the author, the hip hop performers themselves, and other scholars."
positive,"Learning Ulysses: For many years I wanted to read Joyce's Ulysses not only pure literary reason but for the ""aura"" the book has. Having received a Kindle as a gift last Christmas, Ulysses was my first download. Now he's with me wherever I go. Isn't that super?! Not an easy reading experience but I'm learning..."
negative,"Terrible DVD of an impressive film: The Stendhal Syndrome is an effective, stylish thriller from horror maestro Dario Argento. The film alone would rate at least 4 (out of 5 stars) but the Troma DVD is pretty appalling. The audio is hissy and the volume low and the picture is incorrectly letterboxed and riddled with digital artifacts. If the DVD weren't bad enough it's made even worse by having a horrible, embarrassing introduction and foolish, faux interviews with Troma president Lloyd Kaufman. A good film is severely cheapened by a poor presentation. A big, fat ZERO for the disc. Hopefully, Blue Undergroud or Anchor Bay or Mondo Macabro will be able to obtain the rights soon and do this film justice."
negative,"This is what we waited fourteen years for?: Billy Joel, the greatest songwriter of his generation, really fell on his nose with this one. The lyrics, which consist of one trite phrase after another, are set to a rather pedestrian melody that doesn't take the listener anywhere. The only thing that makes this song even marginally listenable is the orchestral arrangement. A BIG disappoinment."
negative,"Am I the only one?: Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Why this was so critically accliamed is beyond me. It was all...bleh. The action, the characters, the acting, the dialouge......it was all bleh. Sure, it may be the best Batman movie, but that's not saying much at all. The talk was that this was going to be a dark and realistic movie. I just saw it as another silly superhero fare. I guess I just don't like superheroes. If you want an interesting and dark action flick, check out the Bourne series. Batman is just for little kids and comic book fans."
positive,"Shoe Goo Review :): Great product! When my sneakers start to lose their soles, I reach for the Shoe Goo. Makes a permanent repair that stays flexible. Saves me from buying an expensive new pair of sneaks."
negative,I did not receive the item: I did not receive this item. I filed the claim but I did not hear from the seller at all.
negative,"Just one thought: With dozens of relationship self-help books on the market: ""Why Men Love Bitches"", ""Why Women Love Jerks""... etc, it all boils down to one simple idea.Nice girls who are too compliant are boring... that's why men love bitches. Nice guys who do all the ""right"" things are boring... that's why women love jerks.All further analysis and arguments about self-respect, being a doormat, and playing games are unnecessary. Maybe someone should write a book on how not to be boring..."
negative,"Are you KIDDING ME????: Frances Mayes sold out! She sold the title of her best seller book to hollywood and they used it to create romance novel drivel! It contains very little her sweet, beautiful tribute to Tuscany. What a shame! While I liked Diane Lane I was completely disappointed in this movie."
negative,"All Chewed Up: My dog also chewed one of the straps, and the halti is now useless. Be aware that you have to closely watch your dog when you use the halti to make sure he is not chewing it. I was very surprised to find the halti ruined when I took it off of my dog because I was less than 3 feet away the entire time he wore it."
positive,"Noodler's Black Waterproof Fountain Pen Ink Bulletproof: This is really a great product. It is permanent, waterproof and just an exellent ink."
negative,"The Last Reader, Maybe: Grisham, you've gotta be kidding. I beg my fiancee to let me buy this book -- as we are on a shoestring budget-- and she relents and this is what I get? I love Grisham. I hated this book. I read it and realized it was good for something -- to cure me of my insomnia.This is why I'm writing in my spare time. I'm tired of picking up a book in hopes of it being decent and finding out it's a waste of time. I mean, it wasn't even fun to read. That's all I ask for, something halfway entertaining.And the sad thing is, the next Grisham book that comes out will be purchased by me again."
positive,"It's a treat to discover the unusual Russian tradition!: I stumbled on a great little nugget of unusual repertoireby attending a concert by the artist (The CD was recently reviewed in Fanfare, if you have access to that pub.)Timofeyev plays roughly 20 pieces in over 65 minutes of really unusual Russian Romantic music on the native Russian guitar (7 strings, tuned to an open G chord). His tonal palette is very broad -- he reminds me somewhat of Bream in this regard. It's a real treat to hear music that hasn't been recorded by anyone else. (Apparently Timofeyev discovered many of the pieces himself in ""lost"" manuscripts he studied while completing his doctorate.)His concert also included some wonderfully shmaltzy Russian songs for coloratura.Much as I love the Spanish and Latin American masters, it's a real treat to discover a whole, new, decidedly different tradition to enjoy."
positive,Excellent novel that is Biblically accurate: God and Kings was a book I simply could not put down. It was both exciting and saddening to understand the plight of King Ahaz and the impact it had on the life of Hezakiah! I would highly reccomend this read to anyone who longs for a taste of Old Testament history.
positive,"A book of interest.: ""Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung,"" published for the Peoples Liberation Army by then Marshal Lin Piao, and later for the people of China, is a basic handbook of Mao Tse-tung Thought. Read it with devotion if you uphold its ideals, read it for information if you reject its ideals, but read it, and learn more about one of the most influential leaders (for better or for worse) in all of world history."
positive,"Good on tactics: This book was certainly interesting (admittedly a matter of personal taste) and would probably be recommended for the military specialist, rather than the general reader or even WWII buff. The book is essentially a description of German tactics and the tactical situation in the east. It's not really a general history of the eastern war nor an organized, thematic presentation. It is a compilation of essays by Colonel General Erhard Raus (1889-1956), Infantry General Waldemar Erfurth (1879-1971) and Infantry General Hans von Greiffenberg (1893-1951). The essays cover topics of specific military interest on the eastern front, eg. climate, partisan tactics, mud, terrain, reconaissance etc. The book would only be of interest to those with a knowledge, or an interest in the most specific details of combat."
positive,"great stuff: An excellent album. Great variety and the Basie band really smokes on this one. One of the other reviews talked about the Sinatra/Basie lps, and they're unquestionably excellent--especially the first one. But this title has an explosive quality all its own. Well worth your time."
positive,Emotional: This album tore my heart out and fed it to a bunch of wild dogs. It was an amazing experience. This album has some weak points but overall it is one of his best albums ever. Iggy opens himself up completly and I thank him for it wherever he is.
negative,constantine video dvd: video would not play in either my 3 dvd players so i ordered another video from someone else. the dvd wasn't van helsing. the dvd was constantine and it was fubar. so what is your idea of correcting the bad dvd i received.
positive,"It's a Glass world.: Although Bowie and Eno form the 'start point' for this album, Glass (as he explains in his notes) uses this as a point from which to develop ideas of his own, which gradually cohere into a complete symphonic movement. Although there are clear echoes of Bowie/Eno, this is very much a classical piece, with Glass' trademark pulsing, driving rhythmns, and slow, rolling melodies. Rich, relaxing stuff, well performed and recorded. Just not exceptional enough to deserve the full five stars. Well worth acquiring if you enjoy Glass."
negative,"Water damage not mentioned: This is the way the book condition was described: ""This is a very clean copy with tight pages, no spine crease and some minor shelf/edge wear."" When I received my order, I noticed that the last 75 pages or so appear to have water damage. The lower outside quarter of each page is rippled. If I had ordered the book as a gift, I would have returned it immediately. I would not order from this seller again.I ordered (and received) the book months ago, and I made notes about its condition when I got it - it just took me a long time to get around to this review."
positive,"excellent!: does not leak, lasts for a long time and prevents smell. this pack is the best value i have found. Love it!!"
positive,"effort rewarded: If you have not read him before, it may take some getting used to. Once you adapt to the idea that a sentence may contain dialogue from more than one person,take place at widely separated times and contain little or no punctuation, it is a wonderful book to read.The book moves between the present and the past. In the present a proof reader faces the consquences of having purposely changed a text entrusted to him, while in the past events unfold with history as amended by the proofreader. A wonderful book, but not a page turner"
negative,"THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!: Judd Apatow has reached an absolutely new level of... sucking!!! Even Adam Sandler, one of my favorite actors of all times, sucked too, big time!!! There are funny movies, there are not so funny ones, there are stupid and ridiculous flix and... there's Funny People! Its name should be changed to ... what's the word for utterly unfunny? Almost 100% of jewish actors and they couldn't pull it off? That's odd!?"
negative,"good for music, not for video: i bought this and quickly gave up on the included software. i then went with the tversity free software, which is miles better. however if you have a large divx xvid avi collection you wont be happy. some play. some dont. there's no telling until you try it, even hard wired, so its not a wireless bandwidth problem. i eventually gave up and returned it. who wants to spend all the time setting it up and wondering if it will work just to watch a video? instead i went with an old Xbox (at half the price as everyone is getting rid of them and going to the new 360), converted it to an Xbox media center (XBMC) and its genius. everything works no matter what...divx, xvid, ogg... and it can do so much else too (not to mention you can play games with an xbox if you want to). its not the simplest route but its 100 years past whats commercially available now."
positive,"good cooker: Had a basic B&D cooker before, this is one step up from that IMO. The size is nice to have more leftover rice for the next dinner. It is easy to clean but the switch sometimes doesn't work and twice the rice wasn't cooking, just on warm. So now I just double check 5-10 min after. Works well for brown rice."
negative,Terrible and horrible!: I could not believe how outdated this book seems to be. I opened it and to my horror it was terrible. The exercises are elementary at best and not explained well at all. I can't believe someone published this book.
positive,Very good: This book is fantastic. I read it for my advanced reading class and it is great! The beginning is kind of slow but it gets REALLY GOOD!
positive,Great information: I wasn't able to attend a in person class but I am so glad I bought the DVD to learn about childbirth and what to expect. I fully intend to use the breathing techniques and I learned a lot of information about labor and delivery. I really like I could go at my own pace and watch and re-watch any parts I needed.
negative,"Book'c content not supported by Kerry's military records: This book is more a work of fiction than reality. As a historian Brinkley's book contributes nothing to the history of Vietnam and it is inaccurate in it's portrayal of Kerry's exploits. It relies too much on Kerry's diary and not enough on the recollections of the 200 plus men who served with Kerry. As a retired naval officer and a collector of navy medals for over 40 years, I found major holes in Kerry's records indicating conflict between the book and reality. Regretfully, Kerry has not released numerous pages of his record thus the truth of the matter will not be resolved. One would expect that if the records indeed supported Kerry, that he would have proudly shown them to the world. In the end, Brinkley's scholarship is lacking through a failure to pursue readily available sources. The result is an unbalanced view of Kerry and his service in the Navy."
positive,"Pure Action!: This was a wonderful followup to the first movie ""The Mummy"". It Has some great special effects. Non-stop entertainment.Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are so good together. The young boy who plays their son is a wonderful little actorJohn Hannah is so great as the bumbling guttless brother. He is so hilariously funny. And the addition of Shaun Parkes as Izzy makes for some funny gags!Oded Fehr is awesome in the role and very handsome, dark and mysterious. Arnold Vosloo is so wonderful as the bad dark and evil Imhotep. And, Patricia Velasquez is a beautiful evil reincarnate love!It helps if you see the first movie before watching this one. There are a number of running jokes that would probably not get unless you had seen the previous movie.I agree whole heartedly that the animation of the Scorpion King at the end what horrible. Very rough graphics and bad likeness for that hunk, the Rock.Still, very happy with the movie. A great addition to the other two."
positive,Great Product--Great Quality: I ordered this item and gave a bad rating because I was mixed up with another windsock with another company.I rate this product and this company with 5-STARS in all catagories.
positive,"Lovely: I'm not going to write a synopsis, since that can be found elsewhere. I have to say that Teresa Medeiros never disappoints, and this latest novel of hers proves to be just as worthy as her others. I'll admit that I have my favorites among Medeiros' work- Thief of Hearts, Once an Angel, and Nobody's Darling being, I think, the best. This novel encompasses Medeiros' notorious beautiful writing, yet it isn't one of my favorites. I'd place it on a par one down from some of her best, along with Lady of Conquest and A Whisper of Roses. However, if you liked either of these two above mentioned books, perhaps One Night of Scandal will tickle your fancy. However, anyone who loves Medeiros' work and appreciates truely beautiful historical romance will cherish this novel along with her rest. It will be a nice addition to any collection of historical romance."
negative,"Not a total bust, but...: The patterns are cute, the layout of the book is phenomenal and it's instructions are easy enough for a beginner to learn from.However there are patterns that are a little... off. And by off I mean, holy cow, how did this get into publication being so flawed?? Somethings I was able to just ""wing it"" and others... not so much. The book isn't a total waste, but if you don't go into it knowing of the flaws then you're in for a nasty shock in some cases. I would recommend getting this book second hand, but for full price? Not so much."
negative,"Tedious debut: Silly, syrupy lyrics throughout and, surprisingly, the vocals are completely uninspired. This can't be what Aiken wanted."
negative,"Completely Useless: I don't quite understand why Courtney is allowed to put these things out, and even more surprised that the other members agreed to it (since they have to). Everyone who already put out the 50 bucks for the box gets a whole three song bonus, songs which don't even sound like anything special. Nirvana was an awesome band who made some of the greatest music of all time, and this CD does reflect that. It's a good CD, but it's useless. It's nothing we don't already have. If they're going to put more Nirvana stuff out, it should at least be stuff we haven't heard. Just buy the three songs off of iTunes or something and save yourself the money from buying this CD."
positive,"CycleOps Mag (Indoor Bike Trainer): I am satisfied with this product. It is easy to use. My bike tire makes a little noise with it, but I have read if you switch it with another that it doesn't make noise. I haven't done that because the noise doesn't bother me and I like to be able to take my bike off this and use it outside. I think this provides a great work out for the small time bike rider!!"
negative,bubble bed: This bed sucks after 1 month I was asleep on the bed when a popping noise woke me up I didn't know what it was so I went back to sleep when again a popping noise woke me up again I couldn't figure out what it was when I got up the following morning I noticed a big bubble going down one side of the bed that's when I realized it was the bed making the popping noise smh
negative,just ok: saw this movie over the weekend and it was predictable and the punch lines were a dime a dozen. the pacing was hit and miss as well. I expected to like it once the actual funneral started but then the film became one big cliche and it reminded me of a few other better films in the same vein which this one was desperately trying to channel.
positive,"sublime, as usual: I would have to guess that ""East of the Night"" is Micus's ode to dawn, both in the literal and contemplative senses of the word. First, there's the title: What comes, after all, 'east of the night'?--well, sunrise, of course (think about it for a moment...). Then there's the music itself. The two twenty minute plus works that make up the album are primarily guitar pieces, but they are played on 10- and 14-string guitars, respectively, and after an initial eruption (just like sunrise) drift dreamily along with lots of notes played in the lowest register (a reflection of hypnogogic imagery?). The second piece is a solo work, but in the first the guitar is accompanied by a flute that provides just the perfect airy, and sometimes dancing, meditative complement. I'm not sure this is one of Micus's best efforts overall, but if you like any of his others you will surely like this one too. Score this one a '4 plus.'"
positive,this album takes awhile to get used to: This is an even better album than Be Not Nobody - the lyrics and vocals and everything about it is superb! It's not radio-friendly pop like Be Not Nobody was. Fav songs on this cd are: Annie and Half A Week Before the Winter.
negative,"Not the best: I bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need. Also, I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface!"
negative,"Great fan-fiction.: Not, however, a great novel. It's quality stuff that I'd expect to read on an Internet forum somewhere, but I'm unhappy that I paid money for it in book form.If I wanted to read Tolkien's and LeGuin's stories, I would have gone straight to their books. If I wanted to read an impressive book from a teenage author, I'd have opened up ""The Neon Bible"" by John Kennedy Toole again. ""Eragon"" isn't the first choice in any of these categories, though.I admire the young writer for his discipline in pumping out books of such length. My second star is for that talent. It's a sign that he has a long writing career ahead of him. Like other reviewers have said, I'll check him out again in a decade or so when he starts writing his own things instead of fan-fiction paeans to his favorite writers."
negative,"Blatant Pixies Ripoff: The first time I heard this song, I would easily have given it 4 stars. Great music, decent vocals...in fact, I enjoyed it a great deal. The second time I heard this song, I thought, ""Hmm...this sounds awfully familiar for some reason, but I'm not sure why."" The third time I played this song, I played ""Caribou"" by the Pixies immediately afterward and figured out where I had heard it before.This song is basically a melange of Pixies songs, primarily ""Caribou,"" grafted together and repackaged under this band's name. That said, there is nothing remotely innovative or even creative to be found here. Yes, it's a nice song, but it's basically been done already, and it's been done infinitely better.Please, I beg of you: Direct your funds to their rightful recipient by purchasing either ""Come on Pilgrim"" or ""Wave of Mutilation."" Don't waste your time on this inferior knock-off."
positive,kinsey: came on time and in excellent condition. great story about a great man who changed the way we view sex in the world
positive,"fab book for cowboy gear: This book is fascinating for its images & history for me the Aussie, we just dont have these cowboy suits in our history, & as a sewer who makes cowboy shirts in Oz, it interested me greatly, I got a 2nd hand ex library book & it was mint. Seems like an invaluable keeper to me."
negative,"Blah movie: If you're interested in wasting two hours of your day with the Fresh Prince of Bell Aire, go for it. If you're interested in a scene devoted to seeing his hinie, go for it. If your interested in action, gunplay, realism, intelligent picture flow- then don't go for this one.It's absolutely dismal. It's not worth anymore of my time describing what the previews lead you to believe to be a cool sci-fi flick, which turns out to be nothing more than HYPE."
negative,"Triple Refined Emu Oil: I don't think the product does what they say it will do which makes it a very expensive bottle of oil. The program would not let me submit wtih no stars, which is what I would give the product based on the claims for the products usage."
negative,flimsy: impossibly small buttons and tiny lcd.you'll need a magnifying glass for any adjustments.barely any metal to it -- which makes it light as a feather -- and probably as durablehandle with care!
negative,"Baby is not dry in Baby Dry, Prefer Swaddlers: I have been using Pampers Swaddlers for my son (now 13 months old) and highly recommend THIS brand of Pampers. My goal was to order the same brand from Amazon but the only brand available on Amazon was Pampers Baby Dry diapers so I decided to give it a try, because after all, it is still made by Pampers, a name I trust. I do NOT recommend Baby Dry diapers. My son would stay dry in the Swaddlers but ironically he was soaking wet in the Baby Dry diapers. The diaper does not hold the wetness which would become saggy once wet and leak up the front, so he would be wet all over, in his diaper, his pjs, and his bedding, overnight in this diaper. He also developed more diaper rashes from wearing this diaper compared to the other one. I love the delivery service Amazon provides, but I will not get Baby Dry again."
negative,Good video but not for people with knee problems: I enjoy this video but it is not one of my favorites. Some of the movements are awkward for your knees. The last segment #3 is not intended for people with knee problems and she states this. I have had complete reconstruction of my knee and I am not able to do the last segment. I tried it once and lasted about two minutes; it is very jarring to the knee. I love most of Tamilee's videos but this is not one of her best.
negative,"Not working most of the time, worse than my neighbor's $15 unit: Not picking up signals consistantly.TV Frequently goes into 'Signal Not Found' mode.My Neighbor has $15 UHF Antenna from GE(i think)which works much better in consistency and signal quality."
positive,Still a great read: I still love this wholesome entertaining book written in the days when everyone was raised to be considerate and polite. A must read!
negative,"I wanted to stab my eyes out...: This novel was painful for me to finish. I'm sad that I devoted so many hours of my life to reading this book...hours I will never get back.It is a ""preferred book"" for my son's 10th grade AP Language class...I read it and told him to stay far, far away from it. I found it BEYOND tedious.What's wrong with me? Why does everyone love this novel and I found it so annoying?Sign me ~BEWILDERED"
positive,"Stands the test of time: This was a very good read. I felt the same ""distancing"" from my husband that Betina did for the same reasons; kids, life, social expectations.The book stands up in todays world, just as it did back in 1967."
positive,"better than the new greatest hits: Even though its not a double cd, this cd is special for having the song ""Shaking the Tree"". A must in the Peter Gabriel collection. Downfall of this album is the fact that its outdated. Do yourself a favor and buy this album, Gabriel II, Us, So and Up. You will have a great collection of his best work. If you're a fan buy everything, trust me its worth it."
positive,Good Price and easy to use: The 805 is easy to put on car and easy to put bikes on. Did not handle girl's bike frame well so purchased a bar that connects from seat to handle bar stem. This solved all problems for the girl's bike. Wish I had purchased the 3 bike model. It has 2 upper legs and 2 lower legs. I think this would have been a more stable model. The 805 straps tightly to the car but the bike support arms have considerable wobble in them and cannot be made tighter. I do like the ease with which it attaches to the car.
positive,"Humanism for the Faithful: This sympathetic portrayal of aristocrats, peasants, conservatives, progressives, radicals, nationalists, internationalists, romantics, and even nihilists is ultimately a work of great humanism in its best (and really its only) sense of men made in the image of God. Turgenev captures the vanity of youth, but considerately and without spite. It's an excellent book heartily recommended, even though he goes a little too easy on the progressives, radicals, internationalists and nihilists."
negative,"fluffy and boring: I am a follower of Jesus Christ! I am an avid reader and am in charge of the reading list for a Christian fiction book club. I was so excited when this book came out because I have enjoyed The Left Behind series by these same authors and was hoping I could put it on my reading list. I can't. I could put the books John, 1st, 2nd and 3rd John and Revelation on my reading list...that would be better."
positive,GREAT BOOK!: Both this book and the second book are WONDERFULLY written! I thoroughly enjoyed both books and am eagerly awaiting the final book. It was in great condition.
negative,"Works, but with limitations.: This PCI card is easy to install, and so is the software. The interface of the software is also good. However, the cable connecting the antenna and the card is too short, making it difficult and often impossible to find a good location for the antenna to have stable strong signal. This is especially true if the PC is located under a desk. The cable is too short for the antenna to reach the desk. My desk has metal legs, which may interfere with the wireless signals. I used this card for a year and was often irritated by the need for tweaking the position of antenna to get stable signal. Since PCs are not to be moved around, if possible, installing a network cable will be a far better solution than wireless. I finally bought an RJ45 crimper, connectors, and cat5e bulk cable (for about $80 total) to connect several rooms to my router. I wish I had done this at the beginning to save the money on this card."
negative,"A long promo for the Thomas center(s): Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money."
negative,"Worst of the Wolfe stories: ""Not Quite Dead Enough"" is the worst of Stout's Nero Wolfe stories. To quote Wolfe himself, (minor spoiler) the solution was ""the silliest idea in the history of crime,"" and the actions of a couple of other major characters are almost as preposterous."
negative,"Not what I had expected.: This is a *postcard* book. The Amazon description does not mention this particular bit of information. I was expecting *text* and art, but this is not what I received. Beautiful art, but--again--not what I had expected."
positive,"A ""Have to See"" Series!: Best season out of all of them in my opinion. If you're not a fan of super hero comics, Smallville will definitely change your mind!"
negative,"Great if your only Marine VHF Radio.: This is a great VHF Marine radio if it is the only one on your vessel. DSC feature works well, NMEA interface is easy to wire in. Audio from speaker is excellent. However, it has no RF shielding and interferes with another IC-M602 and every other piece of comm gear aboard so I can't rate it any higher. Great for a pleasure boat that will have this as their only radio. The remote handset feature is great. (This is an additional option you must buy.)"
positive,"cross culture study of birthing systems: This was an excellent book to read in medical anthropology class. It gave a view of birthing systems in only some cultures, but that was enough to show some of the drastic changes between cultures one sees in the woman giving birth and the hospital personnel. Amazing how even with technology some of the fundamental needs of the patient are not being met."
negative,"Not another over the top CD: I am really bothered by the way Michael Ball delivered the songs in this CD. He is so over-acting, no subtlety whatsover. It sounded amateurish and over-done. I hope he learns how to town down in the future. His take on ""The Winner Takes it All"" is so softy in approach. Please, no more over the top performace. Only Barbra Streisand can pull that one!!!!"
positive,AWESOME!: I use this at work. Turn it on before you go to get your coffee in the breakroom. Best if the cup/coffee is already warm.
negative,"Snooze tunes: drool continues to fall-out my mouth, for this is unoriginal, insulting to women, and the same old tires blues-rip-off, vomit-inducing flava of mtv."
negative,"Insulting RIP OFF: With the over 50 GIGS of memory on a Blu-Ray, Paramount could easily fit the first 11 or 12 TV Specials on one disc, but being the crooks they are, they prefer to screw the American consumer by retailing 29.99 for ONE 25 minute episode, one 12 minute interview and a sub par ""Christmas Special"" made 20 years AFTER the original masterpiece. Shameful."
negative,"Good for common problems only: I bought the book since I was suffering from this extreme pain after nursing and none of the doctors I was going to really knew what was going on. After doing research in the internet, I figured it was thrush and the book was of no use to me, since it does not cover thrush"
positive,"Very Enjoyable: I really appreciate how Philbrick writes his non-fiction. I have read four of his books now and they read like historical fiction (but they not...). His ""Notes"" chapter is very complete and the bibliography is excellent."
positive,"Cute film: This is a fun film about a girl who wants a wish, and a fairy godmother (or in this case, godfather) Her wish is not even for herself, it is for her father. However, the fairy godfather is not very good at magic, so he is unable to grant her wish right away, and falls afoul of a witch who wants his magic. Overall a fun film for kids, and adults might enjoy it too."
negative,"Is this fact or fiction?: I absolutely and totally agree with Parenti's view of the American empire but this book does nothing to clarify or validate the viewpoint. It is nothing but pulp. He mentions the US government/corporation attempts to take over countries in South America around the early 1900's. True. He also mentions the American and European interference in the Middle Eastern oil producing countries after WWII. True. The problem is he talks about it almost as little as I just did. He thinly mentions it in passing to impress the reader with his knowledge. The rest of the book reads like a fictional bashing of America with no basses in reality. As I said I agree with a lot of Parenti's ideas but I bought the book to read a documented, scholarly discussion of the topic and this wasn't it. I never finished the book."
negative,PLEASE HELP ME!: WILL SOMEONE PLEASE SEND ME SOME INFO ON THIS BOOK! please! i'm dyin' over here if you read this please HELP ME! you gotta help me i would read it but i can't stand the dang thing and it's soooo confusing. so if you have any info at all i would really appreciate it a character list a chapter by chapter summary any thing...my emial adress is dci80@aol.com please help me!
positive,"Amazing Book!: First of all, Amazon is incredibly great about shipping items as soon as possible. I was kind of bummed out when I saw the projected delivery date was at least a week after I purchased the book, but when I received it early, I was overjoyed. This book is a great read - Max Lucado has a writing style like no other and the way he makes things personal feels like he has been a friend forever.On the page where the information for the product is given, I thought all the information presented was wonderful. Plus, the change to ""look inside"" the book makes the suspense rise until I actually have the book in my hand. Thank you Amazon for your incredible service."
positive,The receiver of this gift has dementa. He and his wife have looked at the pictures and talked. the book came quickly and in good: The receiver of this gift has dementa. He and his wife have looked at the pictures and talked. the book came quickly and in good
positive,"Just kidding around: This book was hilarious. I read it yesterday, and I am still laughing my Asimov. Get it? Hahahaha. Huh. Okay. Nevermind."
positive,"Uhh...Why don't You Like This?: It's not the same game... It's better and not as cartoony, it's still alot of fun. the only problems I've had, is no Co-op. It's pretty freaking awesome. The Map thing is a little bit of a pain but I think that'll get better with mor game play.I like it and if you don't then go play something else and quit whining."
positive,"lacking a little: Overall, this is a good album and has a number of cool songs on it, which is why I rated it 4/5. ""Drunk Daddy"" is one of my favorites. =DBut, it was lacking a little. ""Mister White Keys"", ""When I Change Your Mind"", and ""Come Back to Me"" were't the greatest tracks I've heard. I didn't care for them.It could have also been a little longer. I would have liked to have seen ""Irish Whiskey"", ""Suicide Kings"", and ""We'll Always Have Paris"" on there. =)To me, it just doesn't qualify as a Greatest Hits album for this. It's good, but not for a Greatest Hits album."
positive,"Great Title: The book is well organized, and it shares a lot. It has many pictures from different countries and features J.R.R. Tolkien's colored sketches located in it's center.I was happy to pick this book up, I set the dust cover aside and to keep it in good shape. The book itself is layed out with annotations in side bars along the pages. Looking through it I see an editorial story of how the book came together in it's current finished version.Love this book, would buy another as a gift."
positive,"DELUGE! A Must Buy!: This Album is simply the best James has released. Back In True Form. If you heard james music then buy this right away, if you havent heard Jamed Blundell before, Than you better get this album. His style of music is described as being a mixture of everything and the songs he sings are true, honest and warm. Thats why he is called a Master Storyteller. Every song is Beautiful. Ignore this album and it`s your Loss."
positive,"Too Late For Tears: A splendid movie. Thrilling with a bottom lover story that still happens today.Great Movie, Enjoy it for yourself too!"
negative,"Hard to Finish: I listened to the abridged audio CD version of this novel and it was so bad that I hardly wanted to finish it. The story might have been ok, but the performance by Debra Monk made the sheriff, Joanna Brady sound tired and weak and her husband a total wimp. Yuck!"
positive,Lauryn Hill is the undisputed Queen of Hip-Hop!!!: Lauryn sings with a maturity and depth that belie her years. Her rhythms and lyrics connect instantly with both the young and old. She has deeply touched the lives of young women struggling to find their voice and self-esteem. Her music is fun and provocative. Go Lauryn!
positive,"Use product in bright light: I bought this toy for my daughter, I remember playing with this at a cousins house as a child. Although, I don't remember having a hard time seeing the numbers as a child. I found that it is best to used to product over a light.. if possible, or in a well lit area. I THINK THE PRODUCT COULD BE IMPROVED IF THERE WERE A MINI LIGHT BUILT IN THE BACK OF THE GAME.Durable and fun though."
positive,"OK...: This is an good book, but it isn't one of the best books I've read. Two of the parts didn't make any sense. But still, everyone shouldn't be pointing ou every single mistake. After all, the author was only fifteen when he wrote ERAGON.The book is about a fifteen-year-old boy named Eragon who finds a mysterious blue stone in a mountain range called ""The Spine"". The stone turns out to be a dragon egg. Eragon has many adventures with his dragon Saphira. He makes many friends & enemies."
positive,Airplane II: The Sequel: I love this movie it is still as funny as the first movie and worthwile watching over and over again with bunch of buddies
negative,this movie is uber lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! & uber boring!!!!!!: this movie stinks i hate this movie and this movie has ripped off rambo yes this movie ripped off rambo this movie stinks the director the producers the actors and actresses all stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is easily one of the worst movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
positive,Compelling fiction backed by cultural research.: Balam on the verge of manhood in his ancient Mayan village fulfills his destiny in increasingly drastic efforts to end a big drought. Compelling fiction backed by solid cultural and archeological reserach provides an understanding of Myan culture and why Balam is honored to participate in the ultimate sacrifice.
positive,Wonderful collection: I love this cd very much it a wonderful collection. It I think a better collection then the other one because it doesn't have all of the english songs to see every time we look at a Selena cd. So because of that I think it wonder. The spanish song are the same way it got the songs that we don't see. I think this is a great collection because this is the true meaning of selena.
negative,"Helpful, but with errors.: This book offered many helpful pointers to a technician who hasn't done hospital work and needs some refreshing on mathematical procedures. But if you're turning to this book for Chapter 7's Top 200 Drugs, be prepared to learn incorrect information. There were strengths that weren't listed, incorrect strengths listed, and the use of the drugs was vague to questionable. The practice tests also differ from the actual certification test. I spent hours stressing and trying to memorize facts and dates that the actual test never even touched on. Some was helpful, but some was not quite right."
negative,"Netgear CG814M and Comacst: My 3 star rating is based on my rating of this unit's features and Netgear support - I still do not have it working yet.(I have made 6 calls to Comcast support, but the connection from the modem is still being refused by Comcast.)I called Netgear support to see if they could shed any light, and after waiting 45 minutes, was answered by a call center in India by a technician that I could not understand. An e-mail supprt request remains unanswered after 2 days."
positive,"A Fairly Good History Lesson: MIDWAY moves a little faster than TORA,TORA,TORA and is only slightly shorter. It will be entertaining for those who are interested in World War II and the crucial Battle of Midway which is really more of an air battle than a good old-fashioned naval battle. The strong cast is led by Henry Fonda and Charlton Heston and includes James Coburn, Glenn Ford, Hal Holbrook, Robert Mitchum, Toshire Mifune and James Shigeta.MIDWAY failed to receive any Oscar nominations in 1978 when the Academy Award competition was dominated by ROCKY and NETWORK"
negative,"Major Skip Problem: While the memorex CD player did impress me with it's ability to read through scratches in the CD, it had absolutely no anti-skip protection. Simply riding in a car sets it off at least once a minute. I would definitly recommend spending another $10 or $15 dollars to get a product with anti-skip protection!"
positive,Immigrant Kids: My girls and I loved this book. The pictures take you there and it is written so kids can easily comprehend to what it was like then.
negative,"did they think this would be fun?: i can't believe my very own cousin suggested this annoyingly frustrating game. if you enjoy fighting against all conceivable odds depending on your wit, if you enojoy a game that requires tactics and good strategy accompanied by good graphics and storylines then move along, there's nothing to see here. i truly believe this was created as a quick way to make a buck, there was absolutely no thought process involoved in the making of this game. if you do buy it don't panic, just tuck it under your arm, calmly walk outside, place it on the ground in the street, find a seat and take bets with your neighbor as to how many cars pass until one finally puts it out of your misery. now your talking fun."
positive,"A Necessary Addition to any Nature Library: This is a beautiful Blu-ray disc. Photographer Bob Glusic captures stunning time-lapse photography of exceptional picture quality. The scenes are gorgeous, the colors are fantastic. We see changing sunrises and sunsets over magnificent vistas, waterfalls and cascading streams, birds, clouds and stars, waves and beaches, and flowering meadows. Audio choices include narration, just music, or ambient nature sounds. This is a wonderful film that one cannot tire of looking at."
negative,Fake Just like Hollywood: Historical hokum is what this movie is all about. Crowe's character was made up along with the whole story. Any man or woman that knows anything about Roman history should be offended by this movie. I guess the producers and directors thought by showing you good costumes and battle scenes assumed they could trick you into not thinking for yourself. The sad part is they probably were successfull with a minute exception of viewers.The movies finale speaks for the entire film. A roman emperor doing battle with the gladiator in the colliseum. The absurdity of portraying something like this shows Hollywood's true arrogance. The real shame is that the same type of movie could have been just as or even more entertaining based on historical reality.
positive,This Album is a must have!: A very nice surprise and excellent music. This album shows off the many vocal talents of Clay.Great Stuff!
positive,"'Okay USA': Okay, especially for it's budget, this is one of the best fighting movies I've seen. Aside from it's excellent action, it's got some quirky characters and moments which make the film even more enjoyable. As someone said on a previous comment, my friends and I, too, have seen it so many times that we've memorized basically every line. Hell, I took a break from writing my college thesis last night and watched it. Bloodsport to us is a cult classic, and unfortunately none of Van Damme's later efforts is as good."
positive,"tiny stones; good reaction: The stones are so small you can hardly see them. But my wife loved it, and it looks good on her. She likes her jewelry more subtle than gaudy."
negative,"Meatloaf for the 90s: This album is a bloated, boring mess. The songs are overlong and overloud--they remind me more of Meatloaf than anything else. I can't believe this is the same band that created the brilliant ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory""....Avoid this ridiculous album at all costs."
negative,not really worth it: I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist. I can't wear it anymore. Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours. They suggest wearing it 8 hours? I couldn't do it. As soon as I take it off I am instantly better.
negative,"Most Overrated of the year!: Lauryn Hill music is trash. I love all types of music and why she is so popular is a mystery to me. I do not enjoy her ""music"" at all."
positive,"interesting book: though I'm not a native english speaker, I didn't find it difficult to read it. It clearly represents a period in american history which probably many would like to forget about. Sorry for high school students who couldn't understand it, something needs to be done in order to improve their reading comprehension and interest in their own culture.."
negative,Read the Book: What made the book horrorific/good was not the special effects but the thoughts/feelings of the main characters.The ending was completely destroyed. The writers/director/producer should have stuck closer to the original story and this would have been a much better movie: a classic.C'est la vie.
negative,Warning: I just tossed in the garbage my less than 2 year old Keurig Brewer. This is the second one I owned and the second one that didn't last for more than two years. I should have heeded the negitive reviews I read on Amazon. The good reviews are from people who haven't had one for a longer period of time. I agree the brewer makes it very convienent to make coffee but they are not reliable over the long run. The brewer should last much longer than the ones I owned considering the cost of these brewers. Customer service offered a discount on another brewer but they couldn't come close to the price Kohls Department Store offers If less that two years of service is acceptable to you then go ahead and buy one.
negative,"Promises alot. Delivers little.: I was really stoked to watch this movie. And I honestly enjoyed the first half of the it - the setup. I love the actors here. The look and feel of the picture was great, dug the vibe. A bunch of strangers come together for an insomnia experiment in a haunted house in New England. The Dr, Liam Neeson hasn't told them that he wants to study their reaction to fear. They stay in the house a couple of days and it begins to have an effect on them. Lili Taylor's charactor in particular.That's about as far as I can go w/o spoilage. I'll just say it becomes predictable haunted house story after that. I didn't get the thrills I was expecting. Such interesting characters. Such potential. I've rarely seen a movie that was such a let down."
negative,"end user: I can't get modulated video signal on a digital TV with channel set @33 or any other channels. With the help of a combiner I am able to watch modulated video and regular cable on an analog TV set. Also there is a problem of switching from one mode of signal to another(ie.:IRC,HRC,STD). If I am able to do the switching is somehow by luck although I followed exactly what the instruction says."
positive,"glam rock at it's best: A great representation of the era of glam rock as created by Bowie. Overlighted, fuzzy images create an aura of the days of raw punk music whose power has endured long after it was created. The sound is pretty good considering the recording prowess of the seventies. A necessary addition to your video music catalog."
negative,*ahem* I'm supposedly in college?!: Why have I been required to buy (let alone read) a poorly-illustrated book for a college class??? What a strange world in which we live. Fifty years ago the very idea of this book would have been ridiculed; today it is lauded. I yearn for the past.
negative,"Go ahead, click ""not helpful..."": ...but I honestly don't see what's so great about this book. Daniel Keyes' ""Flowers for Algernon"" and Arthur C. Clarke's ""Childhood's End"" are both better science fiction stories than Dune. They make powerful, emotional statements about the human condition without rambling on incessingly or clogging the pages with useless action scenes. If you want epic literature, read Lord ot the Rings. That story about an innocent hobbit thrown into a destructive war is a million times more epic and personable than this rambling nonsence about a superhuman destined for greatness since birth. Everything is predictable about the plot, not to mention the fact that Paul is next to impossible to relate to.On the other hand, Frank Herbert DID exert a lot of artistic effort into this, which is to be commeneded. Perhaps he should have exerted this effort into a better idea."
negative,"Not good for showers: Nice, item for the price, but not good for shower curtain use; not enough tension force. Best for light curtains in small windows."
negative,"Narcissistic Blather: What a self-involved twit the author is. She catalogs her drunken stupidity and her friends' adultery while pretending cooking Julia Child's recipes is her ""raison d'etre."" The book is full of self celebratory information and demeans the poor author's husband and his seemingly unending patience. What a lucky break Ms. Powell has had, Too bad it is undeserved, if this book is evidence of her worthiness of fame."
positive,"A peek into the past: I first read this book in high school (entirely too long ago!) I enjoyed it immensely. There are those who have complained about Fast's writing being boring, tedious, or going into too much detail, but it is that level of detail that brought the book to life for me. Besides the main plot of the Battle of Lexington and a teenaged boy's coming of age, it is an excellent peek into everyday life in colonial times. I intend to buy it for my own children, but reread it myself before letting them have it."
positive,"Great quality, comfortable: These are just the pants I was looking for when I ripped through two pairs of jeans during home projects. They are sort of stiff right out of the box, but after a wash are fine. After 10 washes, I'd be okay lounging around the house in them"
negative,"Didnt last long: The strap only lasted one day. Tied my labradoodle up outside a shop and when I came back he had chewed threw the bottom strap. The funny thing was he was just sitting waiting for me like nothing had happend, even though his lead was detached to where I tied him. I think the strap around the snout is too big and needs to be adjustable. I will get the next size down and see how we go with that."
negative,"Poor design, save your money: If you are trying to save yourself some work forget about buying this product. The design is very poor and apparantly not properly field tested before it was put on the market. The unit will get stuck (everytime) on the corner of the pool steps(and every pool has steps). It then sits in that position and grinds away at your pool finish and the unit itself. I haven't had mine for 6 months and the unit is worn down where it rubs against the steps. I must then be constantly be fishing the unit out of its stuck position. I have now resorted to lowering a stone-filled empty detergent bottle in that corner to try to get the unit to bypass the corner....ugly. P.S. it doesn't even pick up medium sized leaves, they all get stuck at the bottom."
positive,"Best of Genre: So you're thinking you want a blusey/jazzy Ella CD. Just plunk down some coins and pick this one up. The first track, ""Little White Lies,"" is as good as it gets... and then the CD gets even better. With 20 tracks, this CD will keep you happy for a full, soulful hour. At the end, you'll be gasping for more."
positive,"Pictures + Punctuation= Fabulous Source of Info: The Elements of Style was great before pictures were added, but the color adds even that much more to a great source for grammar and punctuation. Easy to navigate, great examples through sentences and excerpts. Strunk and White have done it right!"
negative,"THIS IS A BORING MOVIE: AN EX-CON [STEPHEN BALDWIN] HELPS THE POLICE GO AFTER A SERIAL BOMBER. HAS A COUPLE OF GOOD ACTORS IN ITS CAST, BUT THE STORY IS POORLY PACED AND THE SCRIPT IS WEAK. NOT TO MENTION, THE ACTION SCENES ARE ALSO BAD. THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. THIS MOVIE AIN'T NO BETTER OR DIFFERENT THAN ANY OF THE OTHER DIRECT TO VIDEO ACTION MOVIES THAT YOU'LL SEE IN THE ACTION SECTION OF YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE."
negative,"A bit too fairy tale: Normally, BB books are quite all right to read, if you're looking for a snach read for a rainy afternoon. However, this one has some serious weaknesses apart from the fact that I personally don't like made up kingdoms and princesses. Part of the story is set in Austria and therefore there are some supposedly German parts mixed into the dialogue. However, Ms. Barton should do a little more research to offer correct German. Only because there are Umlaute does not mean that every vowel gets two little dots on top. The question 'How are you`, when literately translated, asks for a characteristic of a person rather than being a polite formula. The answer to this question could be something like nice, fat or stupid.So, I found this booh really quite boring and way too far fetched. Read this only if you are really desperate and waiting for all the good books to be shipped."
negative,AMERICAN VS BRITISH: I love the American version with Maria Bello.watching it on my Kindle fire. Hope they do another season.but Helen mirrens version is $4.99 an EPISODE to rent ??seriously?I will be adding this to my Netflicks.No way am I paying that much per show.
negative,"Soso: Where i enjoy the workout and feel it working i am upset that o ordersd from this site. The product said two dvds and and bonus, i only received the workout for week 3-4 and bonus mot work out wks 1-2!! Very upset!!!"
positive,"Grisham's Best--but mind the ending: Other than his short story collection ""Ford County,"" this is the only decent book Grisham has written since ""The Rainmaker,"" and even this one, much as I love it, had an ending that made me find somewhere private and cry. Maybe it wasn't such a good move to read it shortly after my mom died, and maybe I should have thought twice because of Grisham's taste for bitterly unhappy endings. It could have easily ended in the courthouse, rather than where it did. Up to then, it was a true page-turner, as impossible to put down as any book I can name. Nothing since by him has come close."
positive,"Costume secrests revealed !: Excellent P/B book that gives the reader many inside tips. Not just ""How to"" but why, and where as well. highly recommended for the aspiring designer. East to read and understand, and simple useful materials and designs are all set out well."
negative,"Cliche, lacks literary value: This is probably the most cliche novel ever written. It's boring as well and isn't even in English. Fail!"
negative,"Agonizingly Long: Like reviewer Jueichi Shen who said it felt like it took him the length of the Odyssey itself to watch it, I thought this movie was agonizingly long at 3 hours and 38 minutes. I will never watch it again, so this one is headed for the public library and a status of tax deduction. Good special effects, though hence my 2-star rating."
negative,"Porn???: From the cover, I expected a loving approach to better sex for couples but after viewing I felt this dvd was very close to being a straight out porn video with no plot or purpose just sex scenes. Will not purchase any additional series or volumes. This is my only my opinion."
negative,"Don't throw away your return instructions.: Just received this book, and am thoroughly dissapointed that it doesn't match its description.This book is a very high level description of the infrastructure and PC-level details required to create a website that streams video. That should be it's title, or at least the Amazon descrition.If that's what you are looking to do - then this book will get you started. However, if you are looking for details of how to use windows media in applications (as I was) - this isn't the book."
negative,Everybody's Fine DVD: The DVD's sound track was defective which made watching the movie challenging. The sound would come and go. The movie itself had a good story line.
positive,"One of the best books I have ever read: I absolutely adored this novel. I first read it when I was in sixth grade and have since re-read it many times over. I felt for every single one of the characters -- even those who were less than desirable. No one character was truly evil nor was any one character truly good. Each developed and matured realistically as to their own personal phyche. By the time I turned the last page page I felt as if these characters had really lived and breathed. I must also say that the ending haunted me longer than any other book I have read. The same can not be said for the next couple of books. The second started off pretty well but then degraded itself by becoming nothing more than a romance novel. The other two quickly followed suite. Other than using them as a sex manual, I can see little value in them. I still care for Ayla and the Clan to want to know what happens next but I will probably wait until the paperback issues of her next two novels."
negative,"Rob Lowe is no Harrison Ford and this is no Fugitive: If you want to rent this video, don't waste your money. The story is so similar to the Fugitive that you might as well get that one instead. Lowe plays a teacher who is in prison on a vehicular homicide charge who begins to suspect a conspiracy to kill off prisoners. After a bus accident, he escapes and tries to figure out how to save his life with corrupt guards chasing after him. I only wanted to see it because it was filmed in Cleveland and it was weird seeing familiar streets on my TV. I have never been a big Rob Lowe fan-I always thought of him as a slick pretty boy-but he actually ACTED in this movie. James Coburn, one of my favorite actors, was wasted in his role of a victims advocate. All in all, the dialogue was terrible, the direction choppy and the storyline has been done to death."
positive,Prime Suspect: This was the first time I had seen this dvd. I was very impressed with it. I will now start buying the other Sets.
negative,"Shock Value + Cliffhanger Ending = $$$: To be honest, between the forced dialogue and the constant, graphic child abuse scenes, there's not a lot of content here. In fact, I dare say the abuse doesn't even progress the story, but uses shock value to keep readers interested. The love is fake, the story never has any hope, and the ending is an outrage. Nothing is solved, nothing is concluded - it's all just so the author can sell the next book. No, thank you."
negative,"Meh.: I dunno how people can prefer this over the original. It is not suspenseful at all, and it is remotely entertaining. Other than that it is pretty boring and overall plotless. The ending was dumb, the opening was slow, and how somebody could walk out of the theatre in a ""state of shock"" after seeing this poorly done film.However, there were a few points that I found entertaining. Such as the pursuit scene through the woods, and at least Leatherface rakes in the bodies here. Hammers, chainsaw, hooks, etc. All that stuff is here but it wasn't the gothic, dark, dirty, creepy bloodfest that the new one was.The new one was far more entertaining and suspenseful, not to mention Leatherface was much scarier looking. I mean, in the this one (original) you do not know that his mask is made of skin, but at least you figure out that they're cannibals.All in all, I give the original TCM about a 2.5. It was good enough to keep, but I kinda wish I had gotten those three other Freddy movies instead of this."
negative,Deceptive Advertising: Don't be fooled by the perfect cut of the countries on the box cover. I bought this for my [...] thinking the pieces were actually in the shape of the countries and it would be a good learning tool. Not quite. Some were. Most were not. Some countries were so small they were difficult to read. This will be in our next garage sale.Springbok puzzles are still the best.
negative,"Should put his talent to better use....: Larry Carlton is one fine guitarist, and fails to show off his talent in this latest release. The session musicians and far to prominent and mask out his playing. I would love to hear Larry Carlton solo, or with bass and drum only."
negative,"Dated screed: I am frustrated by the sloppiness of this book. From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all. I do not understand why this work is lauded as a classic."
negative,"Clay Aiken... where are you???: Clay is a true talent... and I am sure he will grow / mature into a great singer. But this cd is full of pop fluff... there are no show stoppingnumbers to be found here... Clay is not a pop star... he should be in aWestend or Broadway show delivering show stopping number after number. And as one reviewer said... that even ""Solitaire"" wasn't included (which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent)... As for the American Idol creators... we're slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion... and even Clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is INVISIBLE!!!"
negative,"wonder woman costume: This was purchased for my daughters halloween costume. BEWARE! Very cheap material! The sizes are different from what it reads online, and the pieces of the costume are different sizes. For example: the skirt is waaaay too small but the pullover ""boots"" fit just fine. As all the other reviews claim, the outfits ""color/graphics"" peeled off because it was stuck to the plastic package. I do not recommend this unless they are only using it for dress up."
negative,"Not worth buying--BUY THE ORIGINAL!: I grew up on these books and the biggest part of their allure and charm was the nightmarish and frightening artwork by Stephen Gammell. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that they are being re-drawn with a washed out and flowered up style. Please take my advice and buy the original, it is definitely worth it, I promise. I think it is sad that some children will never know the original drawings because parents are too uptight and make a big fuss about them. Too sad. They are SUPPOSED to be scary, you know?"
positive,Love!: I am collecting the Penguin cloth covered books. These classic books look awesome in a bookcase. I would highly recommend them.
positive,"You can't go wrong with this....: There is something about Amelia Bedelia that captures the attention of children, my 7 year old son can't get enough of her. If you want your child to discover the joys of laughter and fun in a book then you have to buy this!"
negative,"Uninstructive book not based on concepts, and even off-topic: I am not able to say that Erich Fromm's book The Art of Loving really is about the art of loving. The only important message I was able to digest is that loving is something you do, not something which happens to you. I do not follow how this book could be labeled as practical when it does not really contain any program at all, rather, it contains a lot of unwarranted criticism of modern society.The book contains many easy to disprove statements. Also, Fromm does not bother to explain how he came to his conclusions - it's like a mathematical textbook that contains theorems and claims without any proofs or defitions. In other words, there are not many lines of reasoning to be found. All in all, I am disappointed with the quality of Fromm's thinking."
positive,"atlanta/time: A excellant CD/DVD single,from these extremely talented musicians,there stage performances like there music is exciting ,and an extravaganza .If you liked there follow up album SHINE these two extra tracks are BRILLIANT!too.A welcome addition for a devoted fan like myself of these dashingly beautiful talented ladies.GREAT MUSIC."
negative,"Wonderful Show, but a Very Poor Version: Let me say first that, yes, like you, I too adore this warm, wonderful Christmas classic. No Christmas would seem complete without it. But it is *because* I love this show (and otherwise would give it five stars without hesitation) that I'm forced to give a one-star review of this particular 2008 remastered/deluxe version. The reason? This new version is out of sync. In other words, the mouth movements of the characters as they speak no longer properly match the actual voices you hear on the audio track. If you already own this version, watch yours carefully; you'll see what I mean. There's a noticeable lag. If you're considering buying this DVD, you might want to wait until Warner Bros. gets its team back to the drawing board and amends this annoying error. Perhaps such a flaw won't bother some viewers; but if you're like me, it will detract from the beauty of this classic every time you watch."
negative,"Illegible: Break out your magnifying glass when you read this Bible. The print is tiny and the patges are thin so that the next page shows through. This compact version is a bit too compact. It's fine for readers with healthy eyes under age 40, yet the pages seem fragile and I question how well this version holds up with prolonged use. Back to the order page for me. I need to find one that I can read easily and that will last for the remainder of my life."
positive,"Who was Capitola?: At my aunt's birth she was given the name, ""Capitola."" I was always curious as to where that name had originated from and later I was told that my grandmother had taken it from a very popular novel at the time. Like my grandmother I have very much enjoyed reading The Hidden Hand. Capitola, the feisty and subversive heroine of the book puts a lot of playful pressure on the conventional Christian and genteel values that are in the end reaffirmed. I highly recommend this book."
negative,"Not good---at all!: I bought this figuring I got a good deal on a CD player, turns out I just wasted my money. The headphones were horrible, they had a lot of static. And the player itself, well it had to be on a completely flat surface. In a car is not a good place to listen to it. It skips often, and it broke only after a month of purchase."
positive,Victorian Trade Cards: Historical Reference and Value Guide: A wonderfully written book on the topic of Victorian trade cards. Information is given on the history of the cards as well as many examples. I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in collecting or just want to know more about Victorian cards.
negative,"A Disappointing Read by Two Excellent Breeders: This authors of this book really needed the assistance of a professional writer! There is a lot of general information, and the specific information that is included is rather dated (as can be expected; Barbara Bergquist has been involved with the Maltese fancy for about forty years!)I am reading all I can about Maltese, and suggest that serious fanciers (or would-be serious fanciers) get The Complete Maltese by Cutillo, that people who want a good overview of the breed get Howell Book House's The Essential Maltese, and that both get Dog Fancy's Popular Breed Series publication about Maltese (at larger pet stores or www.dogfancy.com)."
positive,Great product: Looks and fits great! My son is in high school and these are a part of his uniform. He loves them....
positive,Shearling Slipper: The International Women's Genuine Shearling Slipper is well made and comfortable to wear. It's rubber sole makes it a secure slipper on wet floors.
negative,"Amazon mix-up: I ordered a Canon camera battery. NB-5L.Some company (not Amazon) sent the wrong battery.I tired to send it back. Too complicated. (Many emails, lots of forms.) I found someone who needed the incorrect battery (NB-4L) and gave it to them.Then I went to a real store and bought the correct battery.Bad taste in my mouth remains."
negative,"don't buy it, don't rent it - even if it is free: I gave it a one-star because that is the lowest rating available. Negative five star is more like it.With the hype, you would think it is a decent rental, but it is not. It is a complete disappointment.Mel dancing with the cloth tree - nauseating! It amplifies his ""shortness."" In fact, this film shows Mel is over the hill. Poor Mad Max. Helen - same old girl next door overrated nothingness.The story - what story? The rolling credit was a great relief. What a ripoff!"
positive,"A great story teller tells a great true story: Alan Moorehead does wonders with the story of Charles Darwin aboard the HMS Beagle. This is a very readable version of the voyage for the non-biologist and the non-sailor. Other accounts of the story (including Darwin's) can be tedious to the casual reader, but this reads like an adventure novel. The book uses many direct quotes and MANY illustrations made during and immediately after the voyage. This text with these illustrations brought together makes a wonderful presentation of one of the most important voyages in history."
negative,"Needs repair every two years: We've had our Solis SL90 for 6-7 years now. It makes great tasting beverages, but - it's been in for repair 3 times already. Twice the control board stopped working properly, not heating the machine. Each repair cost around $100. For a $500 product from Switzerland, I would expect more reliability."
positive,"Easy jumpstarts: First of all, don't buy this model. Get the ""Duracell"" version. It is the exact same unit with different decals, but it's $70 cheaper. You would be a sucker to get this one.If you are buying this thinking that you will use the ""display screen"" or radio then you're in for a suprise. These extra features are very cheap (broken from the start). The light seems to be the only useful extra feature. This all seems to be outweighed by the fact that this does its job well. This will jump a V8 with a dead battery with no problem, and faster than jumper cables will. I have used this 6-8 times to jump a V8 on one charge.If you simply want something for jumping a car or suv anywhere fast, easy, and reliable then this is it."
negative,Just get the real deal. Dr scholls. This doesn't work.: A waste of time and money. Didn't do anything for me. Just pay an extra $10 and get dr. Scholls wart freezer
positive,"Even better than Spiderman 1: I liked Spiderman 2 even better than Spiderman 1. There were some scenes where he ran around with his suit but not his mask that added some interesting twists. I really liked the ending, but I don't want to ruin it for you, so you'll have to watch it yourself to find out. The second disk that was a documentary about the making of Spiderman was great too. I couldn't believe that Doc Ock was a Brit! He's very different in the documentary than he is in the movie. It was fun seeing all the blue screen stuff too."
positive,"Exceptionally well researched.: The media has an awesome power to mold public opinion and shape policy. This book not only sets the record straight on various issues through its examples (worth the reading just for that), but shows how to become better news consumers. The research is impressive, the writing made the reading easy and the perspectives gave me a whole new view of what I am reading, seeing and hearing in the media. This is a real eye opener."
negative,"JUNK: I GOT THIS PHONE 6-9 MONTHS AGO, IT WORKED VERY GOOD AT FIRST, BUT NOW WHEN I TALK ON CORDLESS PHONE NOONE CAN HEAR ME, I AM REDUCED TO USING THE SPEAKER PHONE. PANASONIC'S CUSTOMER SERVICE REALLY BITES, THEY NEED A LESSON IN CUSTOMER SERVICE 101. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE, U CAN DO MUCH BETTER WITH YOUR HARD EARN MONEY!"
positive,"Fun but short lived: I think this is best for 1-3 year olds. I have three boys ages 2, 4 & 5 and I thought they would enjoy it more than they do.Instead of playing with it like the game it's intended, they like to put cars in the croc's mouth! Which is fine. This is a good toy for car trips or plane rides because it's small, lightweight and quiet!"
positive,"My Educated Opinion of Cannery Row: To start off with, I think Cannery Row is a well written book. Even if the chapters bounce back and forth and are slightly askew, Steinbeck's imagery is well written. I enjoyed learning about all the different aspects of Cannery Row. I didn't really enjoy the ending, I thought it should have been more exciting.I had fun reading this book, even if my other classmates were drooling all over the cover. Mr. Steinbeck, you are my hero!"
negative,"Worthless Radio: Mine quit working a few days after buying it. The radio portion will only work for 3-4 seconds before volume fades to zero. Tried to contact Oregon Scientific for warranty for over three weeks -- no one answer the phone and e-mails go unanswered (not returned as undeliverable, but simply not answered).I will never buy anything from Oregon Scientific again."
negative,Gordon therapy recipes: Not what I expected. Done by someone else quality was poor print was poor was not put together well at all
negative,Unauthentic: I purchased this book without reading the 1-star reviews- BIG MISTAKE. I should've have read it because not only would I have not bought the book I would've realised that this book has baseless hadiths and basically spreading lies.
positive,Some great movies: Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these movies. Thought maybe they would be sub pr because there were so many for such a great price. Actually some real gems and some great actors.
negative,"too confusing...: i have read a lot of books in my life and this has been in my lowest ranked books along with chinese cinderalla, kira-kira, and out-of-the-dust. very dissapointing. even though i am just a kid, i think it was too violent and boyish. Yuck."
negative,"Sized wrong: I wish I had read the previous review before I ordered this bra. It doesn't just run on the small side, the sizes are completely off. Believe us, the cup size is about 2 sizes smaller than should be. If you order a ""D"" cup in this bra, you will get the equivalent of a ""B"" cup, I went so far as to measure it against a ""B"" cup and they were approximately the same size. Save you money, time, and return postage."
negative,"totally disappointed!!!: I bought this toy for my newborn niece after seeing it on commercials and reading others' reviews just to be disappointed! The commercial made it seem like the little fishes were moving and the lights looked really pretty. I decided to test it out before I gave it to her and I am so glad that I did. To my surprise, neither the fishes nor the water moved, the lights were not as nice as I had anticipated, and frankly it was just plain BORING!!! I bought this toy under false pretences and I would not recommend it to anyone."
negative,not as good as expected: I haven't found that this sharpener is as good as expected. It doesn't stay solidly 'stuck down' on the surface you put it on. I guess that's not so terribly bad...just a nuisance. It's not very stable.
negative,"not great: Cool idea BUT, this isn't really worth it. I bought it for myself but would never use it. On a positive note my 14 yr old liked it. I wouldn't recommend it for an adult."
positive,"Simply the Little Einsteins!: I bought it because my daughter was going for vacations with her grandparents in Costa Rica, and she loves the Little Einsteins. I watched it with her before traveling and she loved it, as every time she watches the show. I am now happy that she will get entertained during the rainy afternoons."
negative,"I got burned after few hours wearing it: the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. I tried to wear other side, after few hours, I got deep burned both on the right and left belly, the skin was torned, swell, bleeding, lot of cross cut on the skin, itched for a week until now. It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease...I am scared to dead when I look at it now. I don't know why I got it , I used something like this before, but I didn't get any bad thing. or the rubber hurt me ?"
negative,"THESE COME AS ONE PAIR, & NOT 3 PAIRS AS PICTURED!!: I'm sure these are great socks, but I was slightly disappointed when I thought I was getting 3 pairs for the price listed...my package arrived and there was only one pair for the stated price. I feel like the image with 3 socks was deceptive and ""false advertising"", as it states nowhere else how many pairs are sold for the stated price. Hope I enjoy the socks, but thought I'd warn everyone else before they buy these and expect more than what you'll receive."
positive,"Paolini's Magic: I thoroughly enjoyed this fantasy. Right from the beginning I wanted to know about the blue stone and it's magic. The story was fast-paced, well-balanced and beautifully descriptive. I was as much in awe of the evil as I was the beauty. The story had elements of surprise and I wanted to keep reading without pause. I am anxious to find out where Eragon and Saphira will take me next and what kind of adventure they will have getting there."
positive,"A personal insight to physical and mental perseverance.: Bob Holtel captures the essence of all essential ingredients that combine to produce an envied athletic endurance achievement. For anyone who has rested on their own laurels of completing a marathon or two, only they can truly appreciate Bob's accomplishment - Running four consecutive marathons every week, 12 weeks straight for three consecutive summers, on uneven rocky trails and at altitude!!! The solitude of it all, the courage to run with pain and complete the task at hand, the enjoyment of simple pleasures of mountain running - these are all brought home in vivid detail through this account. As an athlete I am honored to have shared the adventure. This book has produced a new hero who has proved again that with vision, preparation, planning and courage you can accomplish your dreams."
positive,Decent but not great: This was a decent but not engrossing read. The charecters were just not that compelling and while the storyline was original in that it did not recycle the same naive miss for the zillionth time it lacked a certain spark. It's a bad bookjust not engrossing. Still it's a decent read with likeable if somewhat shallow charecters and a fresh story line.
negative,"Not my favorite Poitier film: I think the point of this film is about faith. Everyone likes a good miracle movie. Right? Well, not quite. There was plenty of cringe worthy moments regarding race. Mr. Ashton calling Homer 'boy' and then telling the nuns that Smith was lazy and shiftless-but still wanted him to work for him. (Weird.) I hated the scenes where he was just shuffling to please them. And I didn't understand why Mother Maria simply couldn't say 'Thank You' especially when she was begging for everything. Out of all the good roles Poitier has played, they give him the Oscar for when he played a good field slave doing what he was told. Whatever."
positive,"Not the best..not the worst: I was so excited when this book came out. 11 1/2 years was so long to wait. I thought that there were many interesting parts to the book, but that overall, the book lacked the excitement of some of the earlier ones. However, I must say that I am looking forward to the next book, given that Ayla's life has taken an amazing turn and has a promise of greatness and drama."
positive,Great CD: Its a great CD but its too bad track 14 - the miseducation of lauryn hill track is recorded poorly and has an annoying crackling sound that just ruins it.
positive,"Love Comodynes Tanning Towels: I had been a regular user of tan towels, and rec'd Comodyne towels in my stocking at Christmas - love, love them. The color is very natural and there is no odor as there was with tan towels. I'm hooked! Went to a wedding last week and used them on my legs, chest and face, rec'd comments that I had a healthy glow. I used more on my legs than face and chest - and still enjoying the color."
negative,"HORRIFIC: ATENTION ALL PERSONS!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS NOT FUN.You'd think that they'd have music and the game does,until you make a move pretty much.Poorly designed,Buggy,You could go on and on about it's flaws. final grade F ...NOT BUY THIS GAME"
negative,"Did not stick to the shoe!: DO NOT BUY THIS... it does not repair shoes. :( We bought it hoping to fix 3 - 4 pairs of shoes. But it did not glue the sole of the shoe back on to the shoe at all. I am not sure if there is a trick we missed, but it did not work. We followed all the instructions on the package... and still failed. Save your money and buy a good new pair of shoes."
positive,"An amazing follow-up...: I've been in love with Shirley Manson since I saw the video for 1995's Only Happy When It Rains. Since then, I've never been once disappointed with her or the rest of the band especially when it comes to this CD. Version 2.0 is an amazing blend of techno and guitar melodies. I'm totally convinced that every year Garbage just gets better and better."
positive,"Brad Renfro films are always good.: I missed this title when it was in theaters. I have learned to appreciate Brad Renfro. Too bad, like Charlie Sheen, he was hooked on drugs but at a younger age."
negative,"Wrong Hero: This book was, according to various sources, written in 1999, so it is hardly intruding on Brown territory esp in regard to the book Angels and Demons, which also deals with the election of a Pope. Compared to the Brown books its lowkey version of events makes it actually rather effective. Unfortunately it ends up making the same mistake as the Brown book, its villains turn out more worthy of sympathy than its heroes. In particular the Cardinal Alberto Valendrea, who Barry is determined to paint as such a scoundrel, won my admiration far more than the unhappy Colin Mitchner and his colorless girlfriend. Both the Father and the Cardinal are contesting over the content of the lost Third Secret of Fatima, which in this reviewer's opinion might as well have stayed lost. The book's a good airport read, but there's little of serious import about it."
negative,"not the right fit: This belt was not the right fit, we used the letters and numbers off the belt to place the order.... but still would not fit it was too big."
positive,"IT IS DIFFICULT NOT TO LIKE AND ENJOY THIS ONE.: The bright, large and, I might add, accurate, illustrations in this book are great, eye catching and very, very well executed! The story line is simple, a kitten who is searching for her purr. Her encounter with the barnyard animals keeps the story moving. The text is well matched with the illustrations. This is a cute warm story and is an excellent one to read with your young child. Recommend this one highly."
negative,not good: I read the first 3 John Carter books and wanted to see how the story progressed. Edgar Rice B. has made me bored with his style. This story is LONG on description and SHORT on plot. There is so much description that I lost track of what I was reading. I realize he wrote during the last century and people did not realize Mars was what it was. I guess I will be very embarrassed if the Mars Rover proves Edgar Rice was right!!!!!!
positive,"Insightful!: Funny and yet very insightful of our human nature . Everyone has issues in their life, learning to handle them is what life is all about. Enjoyed it ."
positive,Very Interesting Book: Enjoyed this book very much. Realy got to know the people in this book am looking forward to reading the second book
negative,"Missing parts: I received this bird feeder, liked it, but when I tried to assemble it someof the parts were missing. The hooded pieces were missing."
positive,"Must Read for All Christians: This book is a must-read for ALL Christians. In easy to understand language, it tells you how to allow the Holy Spirit to govern your walk so you can be effective in leading others to Christ. It is taking me awhile to get through the first few chapters because I'm being challedged to get serious. You have to get this book and believe me when I tell you this, it WILL truly change your life."
positive,"Eragon is the best: I just can't understand why people rate this book 2 or 1 stars. Some people say that the characters show no emotion. This, however, is not true. The characters show sorrow, anger, happiness, and affection. All the characters are unique and different from those in other books. One guy rated it only one star, but said he didn't even finish the third capter! I agree that it gets off to a slow start, but so do Harry Potter and C. S. Lewis books. My favorite part is when Eragon defeats the shade. All in all Eragon was a very good book, and Christopher Paolini was only 15 when he wrote it!"
negative,"Aerobics section AWFUL, Stretching is Pretty Good: I really hate the aerobics section of this tape. As several other reviews say, the moves are too complicated. I spend more energy getting frustrated that I'm not able to follow the moves, and I start to make up my own moves, and what's the point of following a video if you can't actually follow it. I've sworn I will never do this routine again.I do enjoy the stretching program. It can be very soothing and relaxing - and you really feel FANTASTIC when you're done. I just wish I could make more time in my schedule to do it more often. I use the other two tapes in this series and LOVE 'EM!"
positive,"Worth the Purchase if You Own an HDTV: I bought this DVD set as my first foray into the world of Blu-Ray and I must say I am not disappointed. The picture quality (especially on Spider-Man 2 & 3) pops off the screen even in 720p. If you're thinking of buying these movies in HD I'm sure you've seen them already in some other format so I won't bother reviewing the films themselves. The reason I gave these DVDs 4 stars instead of 5, however, is because of the complete lack of extras on the first two movies. Also the amount of grain is higher in dark scenes in Spider-Man compared to the other 2 sequels (which have almost none). Other than these small complaints I would say definitely pick this set up if you want some nice demo discs for your collection."
negative,"Any one-sided view of history is poor: Of course, it is good for westerners (or any culture) to see history presented from the perspective of another culture. But this fantasy is not in any way an objective or representative depiction of either the history of Spain or even of Al-Andalus. It is about as balanced and accurate as, say, 19thc western fantasies about ""progress"" and colonialism (or a Cecil B. DeMille epic depicting Middle Eastern history). Read a good book on the topic and skip this pretty but shallow, biased presentation."
negative,"Not for the novice: After reading just a couple of her receipies, I discovered this book is not for the faint at heart when it comes to baking. Although when I watched her on an early morning program, I gathered there was a more balanced experience of receipies. Her citation of types of flour is simply more information that I was interesting in having and boardered on what one might call flour snobbery. So far, the only method I have regularly incorporated in my pastry baking is her reference to chilling. So as all is not down the pastry funnel, I will pick and choose a few more receipies now and then to try."
positive,"Garbage is great!: Garbage's first album was a without-a-doubt 5 star, probably my favorite album ever. Version 2.0 is really good, but just a notch under the first. Still it is pretty darn good! The album doesn't have super hits like ""Stupid Girl"" ""Queer"" or ""Only Happy When It Rains,"" but it does have good songs. My favorite, which sounds like the Garbage most people know, is ""Temptation Waits."" ""Hammering in my Head"" is great, too. The most popular ones, ""Push It"" and ""I Think I'm Paranoid,"" are popular for a reason, too. Overall, it is a great album."
positive,"The great children's book: What some people don't seem to realize is that The Hobbit predates The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien didn't anticipate just what his larger work would be about, but he worked it around a lot of the elements in The Hobbit.This first book was not written as a prequel, but as a story in itself. It lacks the epic scale, being more of a children's bedtime story, and an incredible one at that. If you've read it after reading The Lord of the Rings, expecting something in the same vein, you're not going to find it. You'll get a rich tale with no peer in children's fiction, written for the sheer enjoyment. The complexities of Middle-Earth are absent, and the excitement of the quest is the focus.Growing up I had the good fortune of having The Hobbit read to me over and over. When I was old enough to take on the Ring trilogy, it was a joy to see the mysterious land of Tolkien's imagination grow into a whole history. I suppose this is the ideal way to experience The Hobbit."
negative,"Worst binding ever: This is a fantastic novel...it is really beyond a novel and beyond reproach. The paperback Gabler edition, however, posesses what is quite possibly the most worthless and flimsy binding of any novel, great or small. If you read the entire book (a difficult task, but well worth it), it is guaranteed to crumble in your hands like the gilded pork kidney dome of new Bloomuselem. All that expensive German philology and bibliographic science bound with bubble-gum and rubber cement. I don't pretend to be fully apprised of the respective merits of the various editions (although I do understand that the original 1934 U.S edition was a pirated and notoriously erroneous text) but you might do well to consider the revised 1961 Ulysses(i.e. The Vintage Books and Modern Library text), over this, the scholarly standard, cursed with a nickel-dime spine."
positive,"Awesome band hitting one of their many peaks...: This is an awesome DVD... the show is nothing PARTICULARLY special, which is what makes it even better. Knowing that this is how they perform at a relatively standard show is sweet. The production could be better, but remember, this is over a decade old. Sound is great, songs are great, performances are spot on.Anecdote: A friend of mine who is a fantastic mariachi singer, and NOT a metal head at all, saw this DVD playing in my door room and noted ""Man, that is a REALLY good singer. He has a great voice."" Yes, Deris does have a great voice, and he is at his top here."
positive,"One Minute Manager, One lifetime of benefits.....: Wonderful book. This has really helped me to perfect my management skills. Easily explained so that anyone can understand. Read it, you wont regret it."
positive,"expensive but worth it: My husband has a tough, fast growing beard. [He is on medication that stiumlates hair growth, so the beard is abnormally fast growning.]Gillette Fusion Manual does the trick for him."
positive,"Long time owner: I bought a version of this cart (the 800) about 25 years ago and it had been flawless until the top handle finally broke. I did order a new handle from Remin, but decided to treat myself to a new one and give the old one to a friend. It had been all over the world, hauled lots of equipment and never let me down. I did replace the cords a couple of times over the years, but that's only because of age.I didn't use the extra set of wheels on the 800 very often and prefer the 600 is it's a lot lighter.I very highly recommend this product."
negative,"Rated XXX-Not Suitable For Anyone!: With last year's 'Fast and The Furious' and now 'XXX' Director Rob Cohen and his team have come up with a new kind of movie franchise; take some bad acting, sophmoric dialouge, surround them with a heavy metal soundtrack, a lot of special effects and tired stunts and hope for the best.....Vin Diesel was fine in supporting roles in ""Boiler Room"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" but he ain't no James Bond, and as an action superstar in ""XXX"" he displays as much charisma as yesterday's bed of lettuce.Even the great Samuel J. Jackson is crippled by the deadly screenplay..you can almost hear him saying to himself ""let me get my check and get the hell out of here""...The DVD is loaded with special features, but when a movie is this bad, it's kind of like puttting a Lexus hood ornament on a Dodge Dart."
negative,"emarker.com to shut down 9/30/2001: Do not buy the emarker. It is being shut down by Sony on 9/30/2001.

positive,"Some errors, missing some points, overall allowed me to pass: I took the new 2001 exams today and passed them both (690 Core, 791 OS). Unfortunately there were some serious errors in this book (like the viewable size of a monitor is not the glass!), but overall very good. I should note that the quiz program that comes with the book is also poor and doesn't really prep you for the real exam because the real 2001 exam is 70 questions and 1.5 hours. Also, a note about the hardware exam: I should have done much better but the new 2001 exams have graphics that are impossible to decipher (like identify the *blank* in this graphic). Even if you got 92%+ in practice exams (like I did), study more because you're doomed on these questions. Aside from that, I would recommend this book, as all I did was spend about 30 hours reading the book and about an hour or so before each exam going over what I highlighted!"
negative,"Stalinism revisited: Oh how lovely. Bellamy forgot to mention the millions of people that were liquidated for the purpose of creating this little fantasy world of his. What happened to all the people that didn't quite agree with this little society and wanted to do their own thing? This is probably the most stupid book I have ever read. Let's just judge imperfect present with our imaginary vision of the supposed perfect future. Great, we all know where that leads. Bellamy would have been a good killer for Stalin, until he finally got choked by the machine himself."
positive,"A dark, intense new direction: for my favorite tv show. Yes, this season was a major departure from the original premise of the show, some people may be put off by how different it is. It's more violent, more disturbing, and much more intense. But it had me on the edge of my seat during almost every episode and I loved the new additions to the cast, specifically Demian Bichir. Mary-Louise Parker was phenomenal, and I loved the direction Andy's (Justin Kirk) character took. There is still humor, but it's much less zany. My one criticism is what they did with Doug - he simply doesn't fit in well outside of Agrestic. But Nancy's progression from small-time dealer to a player in a Mexican drug cartel and its moral implications whose fascinating to watch, and Jenji Kohan turned in a terrific finale, as usual."
negative,The BBC Series Of The Chronicles Of Narnai: I found this series to be quite disapointing. The BBC version seemed very plastic. The actors were too theatrical and their acting too over the top. Characters like Reepicheep were played by dwarfs and the whole thing seemed too stiff. I wish someone would take hold of this wonderful series of books by C S Lewis and make a decent go of it like Harry Potter.
negative,"Don't order this set unless you want to be disappointed: I ordered this set last year just after Christmas and stored it away with my Christmas items. This year, tonight, we pulled it out after promising the kids we'd watch ""Mr. Heat Miser"" after dinner. What a joke! There on the cover of the package are the original Mr. Heat Miser and his brother, but on the actual disc is the live action (lame) movie from the 2000s starring John Goodman.Yes, NOW I have read the other reviews saying you can call an 800-number to get a replacement disc. I just called that number. It's not open until Monday, during business hours.What can I say? This is straight-up false advertising and the producers of this disc should honestly be sued.DON'T ORDER IT!!!"
negative,"Short range only: No matter how well this antenna was tuned I could not participate in conversations over 1 mile away. Makes for a difficult caravan.It did stay perfectly on the suburban roof for the 3,000 mile road trip never once coming off. Buy a better antenna."
negative,"Why an EP release of this film?: While Troma treated this well regarded latter day Argento film reasonably well with its DVD release, and its initial $14.98 VHS release, anyone who is a fan of this talented director's visual virtuosity and deft use of color, camerawork, and scene composition should be aware that this new, reduced-price VHS version of The Stendhal Syndrome is in the inferior *EP* speed mode. I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality. Since the original, more expensive SP version of the tape appears to be in the process of being phased out by the less than artistic-oriented Troma, this is very unfortunate.Please, Troma, give us VHS buyers back a decent quality SP version of this film.And please, Amazon, do include a note in the technical information section when you do carry a VHS tape in EP mode."
positive,"Paco Rabanne for men 200ml: Excelent eau de toilette, soft, fresh and perfect for the Summer. My experience with Amazon was great. No problems. I recomend."
positive,"My boys love it!: I was not so excited about the price but the good reviews on Amazon convinced me to purchase it for my boys. They are 1 and 2. They love it! This set is HUGE. Make sure you have space in your home for something like this. We put it between our two sofas in the living room for now. We plan to move it to their playroom as soon as we do some rearranging in there. The boys have knocked it down playing rough inside the hut. It just pops right back. The setup was super easy. If you don't have a room big enough for the entire play hut then it can easily be setup into two smaller units that are still fun. Great buy. I wished I would have discovered this sooner. This would have really helped out during our snow days and just really cold days when we just didn't leave the house. Also, I plan to take some parts of this unit when we travel this summer."
positive,"Excellent Fantasy Book adept for both the veteran and the novice reader.: This excellent pillar of the fantasy genre is compelling to the bone. The adventure Bilbo embarks is one to envy. The most outstanding detail about Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" is the books natural flow, as it simply carries you along as you slowly and cheerfully deepen into the quest. One of my favorite characters is by far, Beorn. Sadly, if you haven't read Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"", I shan't be able to tell you more about him than he is a fascinating character. Enjoy."
positive,"A fresh new twist to the catastrophic events of 9/11: A light during a time of darkness. When a small town opened its doors and its heart to the passengers stranded when the United States closed its airspace. During a time of utter uncertainty, the residents of Gander, Newfoundland were giving tours, cooking, providing warm showers...in essence, the people of Gander were treating complete strangers as family. Friendships were made and the makings of a great story were formed. Jim Defede did an excellent job capturing the soul of Gander in this book and as a passenger that was stranded...I can say that in a time of extreme uncertainty...Gander rose up and made us all proud to be Canada's neighbor. Read this book. We could all learn a valuable lesson from it. During a time of ""good vs. evil"", Gander fought the silent fight and made 'good' the victor."
positive,"good heat, cheap wheels: I bought this from a local retailer for only $30 (less than 1/2 of the Amazon price). While assembling the wheels, one literally shattered in my hands. I brought it back for a new one and the same thing happened. The third one assembled fine, and the store gave me 3 spare wheels, just in case. I don't know if I would have shipped two of them back to Amazon.It throws quite a bit of heat for such a small unit. We bought this to replace an older radiator of the same design and the difference is striking. I also noted a bit of an oil smell, but that went away after a few uses. All in all, a good heater, but"
negative,"it just gets worse: After reading Isabel Allende's brilliant The House of the Spirits back in the 80s, I looked immediately for other books by her. Of Love and Shadows was pretty good, but then things started going downhill when Eva Luna came into the picture. And this, Daughter of Fortune (Hija de la Fortuna) has to be the low point. It is little more than one of those pink-jacketed historical romances you can buy at the drugstore. Just because the author throws in a ghost or two and some Chinese medicine doesn't make this book magical, spiritual, or deep. It doesn't even feel particularly historically accurate. It's more like the writer just picked a random time in history and did a minimal amount of research into the era. Shallow, poorly defined characters don't help, either. Altogether a disappointment."
negative,"Not worth the Money: Lousy,couldn't be worse. Isn't worth the small amount of money.Wasn't worth the wait for delivery.Makes me more careful in the future about cheap products."
positive,"Great item to upgrade your laptop: I have had 2 of these Apricom EZ-UP's and both were great (gave 1 to my dad). You can upgrade IDE and SATA type drives with the included USB enclosure case. This kit also includes easy to use upgrade software to clone (copy) the contents of your old hard drive over to the new one. The case only fits 2.5"" hardives or smaller and WILL NOT fit 3.5"" drives. Great item!"
negative,"I was disappointed.: I have been searching for a book on 9-11 to hand down to future generations of my family, and I thought that I could not go wrong with a book published by Life. However, after perusing through the book I ended up returning it. If you are interested only in what happened in New York City, this is a great book--but the Pentagon and Pennsylvania incidents barely received a page or two of coverage. Since I live just a few miles from the Pentagon in Alexandria, Virginia and drive by the damaged side each day as I head toward Memorial Bridge to work, that is what I am interested in reading about. I am very disappointed that Life treated the Pentagon as a postscript."
negative,A Tom Petty&The Heartbreakers Clone????: JakobDYlan&Crew Sound like they have been Listening non-stop to TOm Petty&The Heartbreakers.if the Profile of this Group wasn't so High&By The way carrying The Dylan Last Name wasn't being always Mentioned they Might get away with this Album.However it really doesn't add much to the last one.it's Basic&Comfortable in it's Element.Tom Petty has had some Moments but He's No Bob Dylan.why would you Settle for 2nd's when you should Strive to be Better than That?Maybe The Next Record will Bring better Results.
negative,J.Mills: This book was an alright book. It starts out with Lennie and George in a town called Weed. Then Lennie's obsession with soft things gets them in trouble. They go to another ranch where they meet a few people. Then Lennie gets them in trouble with these new characters. I didn't like this book that much because I don't like to read and it was a boring book. I would only recomened this book to people who like boring books and people 13 years of age and older.
positive,"Kristina is beautiful!: True, there is little nudity in this video...but the playful, teasing aspect more than makes up for it! And Kristina is gorgeous and you DO get to see her fully nude, so this is well worth the time and money, in my opinion!"
positive,"Lost no more: I love my Nuvi 670. With a road trip in France and Spain planned, I chose the 670 because it has North American and Europe maps preinstalled. The plan worked well. I found this GPS to be very valuable in Europe particularly in Paris traffic.Having used the Magellan system extensively in Hertz cars, I am familiar with this tool. The Nuvi 670 compares favorably in every category. The hands-free phone and the MP3 function work well. I highly recommend this item. However, there are a few negatives. Rarely, it will send you the wrong way on a one-way street. The traffic alerts have not been useful so far. Traffic is reported that has already cleared or traffic appears with no alert. I hope improved technology improves this function because I would find it valuable but not at the current standard. I also wish that the restaurants were kept more up-to-date."
negative,"This book could have been something special...: It's a shame this book was so poorly written, and misleading in its title. The Java/Tomcat community has been struggling for some time with Tomcat, trying desperately to gain some sort of useful insight from the horrid online documentation. Then along comes this long-awaited manual that could have easily saved the day for thousands of sysadmins.Problem is, this book provides next to no useful information on the integration of Apache and Tomcat. It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own."
positive,"Crocodile Creek makes the best puzzles!: Crocodile Creek makes the best puzzles!!! The designs are darling, and the quality & durability is unbeatable. Other puzzle makers just put a protective coating over the design on the front of each puzzle piece, and they leave the cardboard on the back unprotected. With the Crocodile Creek puzzles...each piece has a protective coating on the front & BACK. I was not expecting this when I purchased this puzzle. I was pleasantly surprised! How nice when you are dealing with toddlers and young children who are still using sippy cups that may spill or leak while they play!! My son loves this puzzle and the big pieces are great for little hands. Crocodile Creek...I have become your biggest fan!!"
negative,"Maybe it's funny if you're friends with the cast and crew?: I rented this film because I'm a huge Morrissey fan. I knew nothing about it, but was excited to check it out nonetheless. I am usually not one to write scathing reviews, but I must agree with the reviewer who stated that this was one of the worst movies he or she had ever seen... Very rarely funny, My Life With Morrissey is a mixture of stupid ideas, redundant jokes, bad camera work and poor movie making. While watching the film (and I did force myself to watch the whole thing) I kept thinking, ""If this was a college film project and these were my friends, I would probably find it humorous... But I don't know these people, so it's just annoying."" It's not that I'm some humorless Morrissey fan upset about the portrayal of Moz and his fans, it is just that the movie is simply not good. If you REALLY want to experience this movie, by all means rent it -- don't spend your hard earned dollars on it..."
positive,"A Unique Contribution: Dr. Groth's work is unique in holocaust studies. It is by a survivor who interviewed survivors to gain statistically valid insights into their experiences, knowledge, and attitudes both before the holocaust and after. Dr. Groth's approach is sympathetic but scholarly and objective. Of particular interest is his own assessment of the scholarship of others in this field. Although he recognizes, of course, the brutality of many Germans, he rejects the Goldhagen conclusion that the German people as a whole were particularly conditioned and prepared to perpetrate the holocaust."
negative,"IRRESPONSIBLE!: The film looks great, the music is legendary, so why can't I recommend this love story? I have two quibbles, and they are BIG ones: 1) For those who haven't seen the film, the titular star-crossed lovers of this piece both commit suicide, and this is a bad message to be sending today's youth. Would it not have made for a more happy and dramatic ending had the Capulets and the Montegues worked out their differences? My second knock is levelled against the film's screenwriter. People talk REALLY weird in this movie and half the time I couldn't figure out what they were saying!!! To sum up, this film is an incoherent and socially irresponsible mess!"
positive,"Lovely Like The Moon: Some nights when I leave work for the day I look into the night and always feel so much better when I discover there is a full moon. I feel the same way about the music of Jennifer Warnes. I'm glad to know it's there. Jennifer and her beautiful voice has been such an inspiration to me over the years. I am truly glad that this collection includes her early work. Jennifer's music will stand the test of time, i.e. 20 or 30 years from now people will still be listening to the music of Jennifer Warnes. But you don't have to wait that long. Buy this great collection of songs and give your heart a treat! After all to quote a Jennifer Warnes song ""all we have is here and now"". So buy it!"
positive,"precious: I bought this as a gift for two little farm boys age, 3 and 5. One of them is a crippled lamb. The prose and illustrations are just what I had hoped they would be. Wonderful!"
negative,Not good!: I purchases this set for simple craft projects...mainly to cut card stock and cardboard. I tried hammering the punches with my 12 oz. hammer and it didn't go through the card stock. Got my husbands big beefy hammer...it still will not punch through thin card stock. I am very disappointed in this product. Glad I didn't pay a lot...complete waste of $
negative,"Sometimes It Might Give the Right Length...: ... but usually it just produces random numbers, measurements that are impossible (22 inches?!). Apparently the makers are aware of this habit, as the instructions said to wipe the shaft to dry it otherwise you get crazy results... but this unit was not wet. It started doing that right out of the box (as soon as I replaced the battery, because of course the one already installed was dead... so much for the ""spare"" battery.) Later it started occasionally giving ""right"" answers (at least the numbers looked reasonable and when I opened it and closed it it returned to zero) but then it reverted to crazy answers. A piece of junk."
positive,"Beautiful!: The Oginski's style is very similar to the Chopin's. Well, they were both Polish and created in the same era. However I think I even prefer Oginski. I only wish that CD encluded the most famous Oginski's Polonaise: ""Farewell to the Fatherland"" (""Pozegnanie z Ojczyzna"")."
positive,"Excellent Novel!: This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I was assigned to read this book for my English class. I thought that it would be one of those ""boring"" books, in which i would lose intrest in right away. But when I picked up this book and started reading, it caught my attention immeadiately; I was hooked. I could not put the book down. The plot has so many twists and turns, that I would defintely recommend it to any one. I am not a big ""book"" person, but this is one that you definately must read."
positive,Absolutely Fantastic!: No skippers on this cd! I want to listen to every single song--each one is better than the next! This has got to be one of the best cd's I've heard in a very long time. I hope this is just the first of many cd's in my Clay Aiken collection. I'm very impressed.
positive,"Bridehead Revisited Review: After seeing the movie of Brideshead Revisited, my only conclusion can be that 4 CD set of Bridehead is far superior than the recent movie production. Having seen this production 25 years ago, made me realize just how great it really was and very much ahead of it's time. I recommend this CD set to everyone who enjoys superior acting and real art.It was absolutely brilliant and historic."
positive,"The album is awesome, and still doesn't do Moby justice...: I have all of Moby's albums, and with the exception of the ""Everything is Wrong"" remix album, ""Play"" is my favorite. It has everything, from folk/native indian flavor (""honey,"" ""natural blues,"" & ""everloving"") to breakbeat/techno (""bodyrock"" and ""machete"") to softer love songs (""porcelain"" and ""why does my heart feel so bad"")to ambient (the majority of the last third of the album.) If you like ""play,"" I would also highly recommend the ""bodyrock"" and ""honey"" singles. I saw him in concert this past summer and it was one of the highlights of my life. His music truely touches your soul."
positive,"Satan Revisited: The one chapter about all the horror in Auschwitz is enough to show that Mengele was not a member of the human species and no human attributes should ever be applied to ""him"" in the past, present, and future. He thought the Jews and other victims were sub-human. Why doesn't this apply to him exponentially? It is absolutely devastating that someone like Mengele, who deserved the absolute worst evaded capture for decades as this book clearly shows. He will now have a much harder time evading capture from God. This book needs to be read by more people in the world so hopefully something more positive in society could come about from these horrors."
negative,"Repeatedly Drops Connection: I have the same problem as several other reviewers. The box repeatedly drops the wireless connection and has to be rebooted. I'm actually on my third one, the first two having been replaced by Netgear after the same problem. Reviewers who love it tend to be those who just set it up. Setup was easy and the unit worked beautifully in the beginning but as another reviewer said, it seems to run too hot and just wears itself out. The drops initially only happened every few days, now a few times a day and any time I attempt to move a large amount of data. Alas, will have to replace the unit again."
negative,Poor Copy: Very poor copy. I taped this same movie a few years ago and would have been better off making my own copy.
positive,"can't say enough good things about this movie: just incredible...The acting, directing, and pacing are all perfect! Watching this with the volume up is a surreal experience.Buy it! ;)"
negative,What to do to get Seaon 5 and 6: The rating is not for the show but for the delay. Why is it taking so long to get these seasons of one of the best TV shows of all time to DVD? What do we have to do? We want to all go about this in a legal way but it seems that we are being pushed to illegal means in order to obtain these shows. I'm sure I could get them from numerous vendors throughout Thailand. It would not surprise me if these two seasons are already available for download off the internet. But some of us want to spend our money legally. And thanks to Fox it seems like we may never be able to.
positive,"a little too slow paced: If you like musical, you'll like this movie. For me this movie is a little too slow paced. I do like the drama part though. My five-yr-old daughter and four-yr-old son like the story too. I first watched this movie when it just came out at the theatre. I was too young to undertsand and slept through most part of the movie. Watching it again was fun. Wish someone will remake the Cinderella story with real people."
positive,"Excellent!: This book is full of great examples and stories from Kindlon's experiences as a therapist at an all boys boarding school. He is right on the money when it comes to understanding how to raise better men. If your a man or mother, you must take the time to read this book it will hep you raise better boys or understand the male culture better."
negative,"For MEN only: maybe they are clever enough to figure out why these actresses,directors, producers, etc. are still in circulation.This film is not only BORING BORING BORING but also an INSULT to everyone ... except perhaps the Far Eastern looking ""actress"" who gets to play the ""friend"" of the protagonist, and who fairly deliberately ruins what was supposed to be a one night-stand (one-night lay to be more precise) anyway, on the part of the slow, but dark-looking Italian HOD (hunk of the day, my abbreviation, he-he). Don't worry, a bearded, rugged looking American is going to fill the Italian's rubber shoes ... Sorry for italianizing and americanizing but there is more than enough of that going on in the film, at least on the DVD version.The film forgot to elaborate on the potential dangers of adult owls snatching kittens though, as it's a romantic, and not a realistic view of the world, and it was definitely not meant to be a horror flick. Then again, some of the scenes are pure horror."
negative,"Better products out there!: The tools provided in this kit is adequate, however unnecessary, as you can get those in any medicine cabinet at home. The actual frost fighter product is what really upset me. When I opened the bottle it was only 1/4 filled and it wasn't as liquid as it was supposed to be. It was like 1 year old left over paint, most of it was stuck to the cotton swab with the first dip I made.There are other CHEAPER products out there. Don't buy this one! I would return it but, all the solution is on the cotton swab!"
negative,"Shaft Job on the Consumers: I love hearing a voice or two pop up to defend this general SHAFT job on the consumers. It smacks so much of studio plant. How about the ""you don't have to buy it"" guy? You know what? More and more, we aren't. Or as another reviewer pointed out, BUY USED. As far as I know, the studios pulling these SHAFT jobs won't profit if you wait and buy second hand. Aside from calling this tactic of continual reissue by its proper name, hurt them where it hurts most, and never buy new."
positive,"Hmmmm, I don't know if this was a good book....: NOT!!! I'm 14 years old and I LOVE THIS BOOK! It is so creative and it has a lot of dialog- which means it never got boring- and it was so interesting! I loved it and rate it 5 stars!!*****"
negative,"Back to basics: Generally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group. No doubt about it: This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy, especially if you need a brush-up on moving averages, etc. Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non-financial analysis on various aspects of business (shipping and construction), this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion. A nice bedtable-reader for the pre-MBA. MBAs should look elsewhere."
negative,"this guy sucks: Rueben is waaaay better, this dude is all teeny-lolipop-bubblegum-fruity-cheesey music...if you want some REAL talent, go cop Musiq - Soulstarradio or Rubens (whatever its called)~1~"
positive,"By Far the Best Condom Out There!: Like most men, I loathe condoms for their unique ability to kill the moment and suffocate junior to the point where... well, you know what I'm talking about! But this condom is amazingly sensitive, and you can barely tell that it's there. Goes on fast, and gives you a darn close to bareback feeling. Highly recommend this condom!!!"
negative,"Disappointed: The book did bring back pleasant memories of attending a Catholic School. It's too bad that Gina Cascone hated attending a Catholic School. I kept reading hoping that at some time she would say something good about being a Catholic. But that never happened. If I hadn't experienced Catholic Schools myself, this book would convince me that sending your child to a Catholic school is child abuse. I only recommend this book for people who hated being Catholic."
positive,"SB-28 will work on a Nikon D200: I own a Nikon SB-28 flash, as well as a SB-600. The SB-28 will work on a Nikon D200 camera, you just don't get TTL mode; see page 178 of the Nikon D200 user guide.The SB-28 has the advantage, in my opinion, of displaying distance whereas the SB-600 doesn't in the Manual mode."
positive,"Awesome military book: Tom Clancy's RSR is one of the best book I have ever read. Even though it may seem unlikely that the Soviet Union will resort to a world war to get access to the oil fields, instead of just asking for help. ( They did when their wheat crops failed, and they were supplied by the US and Canada ) But the action is great, and I was just captivated by the book."
positive,Elements -- An Excellent Example of Modern Sensual Poetry: Laura Johnson's work is truly outstanding. At once soft and sensual with a mind provoking kick that leaves you enamored with her style and passion. This book is one of the best I've seen of this genre in years.
negative,Received the item: I eventuially received the item. This was the longest I have have waited for a product from amazon. I contacted customer service and I did not receive a reply. However I did get the item.
positive,"Nobody would believe this in a novel...only true crime!!: It is hard to imagine how the three characters in this triangle came to be involved, but the author did her research well (complete with photos) and shows us how it all happened. How could this multi-millionaire make such terrible bizarre decisions? And this is a true story!"
positive,"Loved It, loved it, loved it: This series is hysterical, so funny! You have to read these in order, the threesome of Sara,(Magnus Pack - Book 1) Miki, (Go Fetch - Book 2) and Angelina, (Here Kitty, Kitty) is to die for, these are the toughest, smartest and sassiest women, I've ever come across and they never give up. Taking on Lions and Hyenas as a mere human, Angelina is bold and fearless but not stupid. And of course she does this while maintaining her fashionista status.She and Nilokai are a great couple and his father is the cutest thing. There's a lot to love and I saw nothing to hate. Just great!"
negative,"Protects for a few bucks, but you can find better: The case for this model looks great in the picture, but mine was scratched and looked bad after putting it on my phone. I originally wanted to preserve the stylish black of my new pearl, but this case did not do that for me. The clip on the back also broke after a few weeks time. Also, dust will definitely get between the clip and your phone if keep it in your pocket.EforceCity offered to replace the product or provide me a refund if I changed the review, but this product was only a few bucks so I'd rather post an honest review of the product and deal with the faults of this product.This thing is still on my phone after 4 months, but only because I am prone to dropping it when I go out.Spend money on a better case or a scratch resistant clear adhesive for the display of your phone (which I also purchased)."
negative,"One word - BAD!: About 1/4 of this book is well written. The rest [sticks]! Yes it is that bad.I love the Earth Children series but I am not going to say this was a good book just to be a loyal fan. ... It has SO many inconsistancies, way too much repetition, and no plot what-so-ever.Do yourselves a favor, if you must read it, wait until you can get it a the library. Don't waste you money."
negative,So so book: I had trouble keeping the girls apart and after reading for a while found myself bored. I did not finish it. But I do not read a lot.
negative,"Don't waste your money: Seriously. This book was a waste of my time and money. The writer tries to be too witty and ""cute"" and ends up being vapid and tasteless."
positive,"Moll's a doll--especially at $2.50: Daniel Defoe, hot on the heels of ""Robinson Crusoe"" came under considerable fire when ""Moll Flanders"" was published. She was called immoral, when, in fact, she is amoral. Churches and universities could not understand why Defoe was fascinated with characters considered ""low"". The fact is, the public adored her and the novel. And it continues to do so to this day.But, as I've repeated in other reviews, the Dover Thrift edition makes it even more of an attractive purchase. Well-bound and sturdy, it's the best thing you can do with the $5.00 you can spare in your pocket. And, if you're like me, and you have to teach this book, it takes a great financial burden on your already overburdened students."
positive,"The absolute best!: I have a VERY picky 4 month old who refuses to eat using any kind of nipple other than these. These are what they started him on in the hospital and although they are supposed to be disposable, we have been able to use nothing else since (despite numerous purchases of other brands to try with him.)"
negative,"Not only HS kids find this book boring...: college grads find this book boring just as well. It was just so slow moving, so uninteresting, so dull and depressing. Gosh, there are so many books out there that I would consider classics. Why this book??? I can't believe readers are giving it 5 stars. I would give it NO stars if I could."
negative,"Meh!: Nothing new here about an extremely gifted talent.This book is a good start if you know nothing of him and you are about twelve years old. For the grown ups I recommend Jimmy page's bio ""Light and shade"" ,which offers much more insight into Bonhams abilities and how he was recorded.Light and Shade: Conversations with Jimmy Page"
positive,"Groomsmen062912: Needed for a wedding and they worked. They are a little tight but I'm stretching them out, width wise but other than I like them a lot!"
positive,Stained Glass style Coloring Book: This mini coloring book in the style of stained glass (Black boardered with translucent images) is great for children of all ages. The dragon designs are well-rindered and attractive. These are a favorite with the autistic children I work with.
positive,"Intriguing Story About Animal Rights: Excellent production. Intriguing story illustrates poaching and teaches subtle lessons about learning right from wrong, courage and teamwork. Charming supporting characters and novel setting. Fun animation, great music. Scary kidnapping scene. Some comments made by younger viewers: ""Cool."" ""There was neat music and the pictures were made really well."" Understood the concept of animal rights. ""I am like the boy and would try to save the eagle."" ""There are lots of great scenes. The good animals are brave and work together."""
positive,If you just want The works then you got it!: I was looking for a small book for my college class on shakespeare and all i could find was these gigantic books of his workds but with other peoples interpretations. Not what i wanted. then i just so happens that i stumbled upon the Dover Editions and they are great they contain just the individual work. Perfect!
negative,"Tell me what you think: Bazyn's next project should be a ransom note. This was a collection of quotes taken from other writers, pieced together, and presented as a book. I don't think there was a single paragraph that did not have a quote. It is one thing to use quotes to support your work, or to provide examples. It is entirely different, and unacceptable, for an author to use quotes to make all of the author's points.Good premise. Poor product. Disappointing."
negative,No Coral Sea sequence on new DVD!: I purchased the Collector's Edition with the high hope that the Coral Sea sequence among others would be included. They are not! The extra scenes they're talking about deal with Charlton Hestons love interest and not the battle sequences! This puppy is going back REAL quick!
negative,"NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!: AAH! This book bored me to tears... literally. Thanks to Charles Dickens and his array of b****y women and the rest of the babbling morons, I never want to see that book again. It was thrown across the room many times in the course of my reading. Being forced to read that garbage didn't help much either. I don't understand why honor english students have to be tortured with his 500 pages of nothingness. I had to get the monarch notes to be able to understand it all! It made me feel like an idiot and maaaaaaybe if it was understandable and shorter.... it would actually be good. MAAAAAAAYBE!"
positive,"Great Product!: Well made, solid, very practical. sauce come out delicious. Retain all the flavors!!!I'll recommend this little pan too any one whose looking for good quality."
negative,"Worked for a year: This was a handy device which worked nicely to trim nose and ear hairs on this aging head. But after one year of not that frequent use it just died. Until it died, I did enjoy it. It's a bit pricey for 12 months of use."
positive,"Clarity XL- 50 was for my wife.: My wife was a little angry at first, but she uses it all the time at the present. Her use speaks for itself."
negative,"No Lao-to-English!: This phrasebook looks reasonable in most respects, but it has no Lao to English dictionary. That means, if you are trying to communicate with someone who does not speak english, they cannot respond to you with words, even if they are motivated and patient enough to try to carry on a conversation.The description of this book said it had a ""comprehensive dictionary"". Unfortunately, it only has half of a comprehensive dictionary. If you want a book that will make it possible to actually converse with a Lao speaker, this is not it."
positive,"Faith Fairchild series is so fun!: This series has been around for a while, but it was new to me. I happened to stumble across this book and couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed the characters, the setting, and the mystery. It was just very well written and a lot of fun. Great cozy for cozy lovers!"
negative,"Keanu Reeves: Dude, I was just attacked by a foot-soldier demon.: Other actor: No way!KR: Way! He was, like...a bunch of BUGS-n-stuff. But I kicked his ass.OA: NO WAY!!KR: WAY! Got a smoke?OA: Does the Pope wear a funny..oh, sorry dude. No offense.KR: Just give me the damn cigarette.Fade to white then to breathtaking shot of Rachel Weisz or Tilda Swinton."
negative,"Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors: It was one of the worst dvd's that I have seen. The sound was not synchronized with the video, the picture quality was poor. I was very disappointed with the people that transferred it over from VHS. I returned it and was credited. This particular dvd should never have been offered for sale..."
positive,Better than I hoped for: This is a more comprehensive book than I thought when I ordered it. I am very pleased. It makes a wonderful reference book.
positive,"A little-known writer worth reading!: Bruno Schultz is one of my favorite odd and little-known writers, and I still own an old Penguin paperback, ""The Street of Crocodiles"". A wonderful escape into the vanished world of pre WWII Galicia, Ukraine populated by Jews, Poles and Ukrainians - although Shultz's world is strictly private, surrealist and fantastic, full of sounds and smells. Shultz's life was tragically cut short on a Drohobych street (city in Ukraine, where he lived), in 1942, when he was murdered by an SS officer."
positive,soniarene: i was so excited when i found this funny show. it's also a fond memory of mine. my husband and i laughed when we found this online. we knew we had to have it. and i was very pleased when it was delivered at a prompt time. thank you.
positive,"Nice clear illustrations: This is a handy little reference. It's about the size of a credit card, but twice as thick. Suitable for a wallet or pocket.There are six cards, double-sided, and some two knots, for a total of 15 knots. The cards are fastened together, so there's no chance you'll lose one of them.I'm just getting started learning knots, and I have tried a few of these. So far this has been a good help. This will be handy to have around. With practice, I'll have a few of these committed to memory."
negative,"Quality of Pampers Dry has decreased dramatically: I was a huge fan of Pampers Baby Dry. With my first child, I faithfully used the Pampers Baby Dry diapers for over two and half years with no complaints at all. I recommended them to friends and family members with babies. With my second child, who is now one year old, I returned to Baby Dry since they worked so well with my first. I don't know what they changed about the diapers, but the diapers continuously explode. I don't leave them on for longer than two hours at a time. Sometimes, the diaper feels completely dry and it still has exploded. The inside of the diaper is also irritating to my son's skin. I am tired of vacuuming up clumps of diapers. This happens to at least one diaper a day. I'm done. I am cancelling my subscription tonight and returning the last box which I haven't opened."

positive,Unbelieveable: TP-2.com is probably the greatest cd's that I own. I have had the album for 4 years and I am listening to it as i speak. Its a cd that i can never live without again. R.Kelly is a genuis and I believe i can go out on a huge limb and say he maybe the top 3 or 4 best R&B artist ever. I can't wait for his new album TP-3 reloaded.
negative,"Don't Watch It / Don't Buy It: Whether or not this movie is based on Kurt Cobain it is still the most boring and horrendous film I have ever seen. In fact, I could watch it all the wat through because nothing happened. Sorry Gus your career has gone out wirh a bang."
positive,"It is the basics: What can we say, there is loads of good books about technical diving out there. Most of them certainly are more apt to cover what we know today. However, this is where it all came from and Sheck Exley cannot be taken to be a great pioneer. Can recomend to anybody that would like to go back to the roots."
positive,"All the Basics There are to Know Pressed Between Two Covers: Silver RavenWolf seems to be either loved or reviled. I think perhaps the reviling is based on jealousy. Silver has produced many books that have helped others get a toehold in Witchcraft with books that are easy to read and practical. Solitary Witch is a huge undertaking. Silver explains difficult concepts, addresses the needs of the Solitaire, and provides detailed rituals and explanations that should be useful to anyone who has an interest in Witchcraft but either has to work alone or prefers to. Get over the fact that Silver has been a successful writer about the religion she loves. That's not a crime, you know. Cover up her name if you must and open your mind long enough to take an objective look at what a wonderful resource she has created. I believe this book will still be being used when all of us are dead and gone. ""Hi Ho, Silver!!!"""
positive,"The next Steve Perry: When I first heard this album with my headphones I went straight to ""This is the Night"" then ""Measure of a Man"". I love both of them. I played them a couple of times at a level I don't think alot of people would prefer. But it sounds outstanding with the music INIDE your head. I then played the rest of the album and was not surprised to hear that ALL of the performances were just as great. I'm telling you, Clay Aiken knows just when to deliver the knockout punch in any song he sings. I believe his vocal strength matches up with former Journey lead singer Steve Perry. I can hear Clay singing the songs, ""Still They Ride"", ""Lights"" or ""Too Late"". The man definately knows his craft. It's no wonder his album is already ""DOUBLE PLATINUM""."
positive,"The best novel of 2004 (in my opinion): This book was very good. It told you all about the passion and rivalry between Mary and Anne Boleyn as they fought to bed the king and become queen. This book doesn't have a lot of grusome events described in it, considering its subject. If you like history, you'll want to read this book.But,it has lots of English Lituature, which can take a while to read. It has a lot of passionate and sexy scenes, so it might confuse young readers. I give it 4 out of 5 stars."
positive,"good information, but...: A great video for the information it provides, though some of the sections do seem brief. You do have to get past her humor, which can be annoying at times (would be better to have more info and less joking around)"
negative,"worked well, but now driver issues: This scanner worked fine for me for a year, and now with later windows 2000 service patches, it has what appears to be USB problems. I've tried the latest driver available on several machines, and if they have windows 2000 with the newest patches, it will only work once or twice, then there is a driver error. I can do the normal windows recovery technicques of uninstalling & reinstalling, rebooting, trying different USB ports, etc. but short of re-imaging the machine, it won't recover. I am using this scanner with Adobe Acrobat 6 Pro with the latest service patches. I've researched and not found a new driver for this device for quite some time. Going to try to hack on a visioneer driver after reading some of the other reviews here."
positive,"Good, easy read...: This was a cute story, although not too original. Easy read. I would read this author again.Classic feel good love story."
positive,"A simple tool - but a real help!: Learning arabic on your own is a challenge. I chose to supplement the Kitaab fi tacallum al-arabiya series with MSA Vocab Clinic to get up to speed a little faster. It gives good pronounciation help, and the word lists makes bus rides a lot more fun..."
negative,"No Vista support!: I agree with the reviewer who said it was inexcusable that HP still has no Vista driver for this printer.It worked great when I had XP, but then I was forced to upgrade to Vista due to other issues and of course the printer has been sitting like a lump under my desk for two months now!I'm quite unhappy with HP's timetable of releasing a driver by JULY. Come on guys, Vista was in beta for how long? It's not as if you didn't know it was coming.And I tried using the original CD that came with the printer to install on Vista, the way another reviewer suggested. I couldn't get it to work no matter what.For that one week between getting the printer and installing Vista, it was great. I would have given it 4 stars out of 5."
negative,Cruel and Depressing Novel: Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.
positive,"Great control racquet: A great racquet for anyone, although it is better suited for the more advanced player. For years, I played with the OS version of this racquet which is noticeably more powerful and is a little more forgiving than the MS version. At this point, I prefer the MS version more just because of the better control and feel.Even now, the Prince Graphite (OS or MS) is still a great racquet, and IMO, one of the best control racquets ever made."
negative,"Cheap Plastic Parts, Poor Quality: This machine does a decent job of cleaning when it works, but it breaks way to easily for the price, and its not built well enough to justify fixing. Too many cheap plastic parts. Consider it to be disposable if you buy it."
positive,"What a GREAT CD!: Mest's newest CD, Destination Unknown, is one of the greatest CDs out there! The songs on this CD have great beats and awesome lyrics! Its a fun CD from one of the greatest bands out there! If you dont already have it...GO BUY IT!! It is well worth the money!"
negative,Magic Wand: I can't say much yet. I purchased this as a beginning maguc trick for a friend's daughter. It did arrive very promptly though.
negative,Software doesn't work!: I am very computer literate. The software provided is not for use with the product. I tried to download drivers so my computer could recognize the camera but had no luck. There are other identical mini cameras like this one packaged under different names. Don't buy this one.
positive,"A MUST FOR ANYONE TRYING TO BREAK INTO THE BUSINESS: For so long the shelves of any given bookstore have been crammed with books claiming to be ""the book that every actor needs"", but yet they read like a foreign language and don't give the information an actor really needs for his or her big break. Ms. McGregor has broken through that barrier and released a book that spells out many of the details actors need to know about acting and the audition process. Intelligent and informative, the book is packed with everything an actor/actress could possibley need! A must for anyone trying to break into the business."
positive,"Review of Purchase: Enya is my favorite. Her music for me is better than Prosac, it's very calming. I listen to it all the time."
negative,"Not Very Faithful: A film adaption of H.P. Lovecraft's short story ""From Beyond"", there is little in this movie that will attract Lovecraft's readers. The scientist is portrayed as a man who was into kinky sex (and as anyone who has ever read Lovecraft knows, he would NEVER have included such details in his stories), and uses the addition of a police officer and a lady who seems to become possessed by the spirit of the dead man to eat up the majority of the plot. Great if you're into gory movies or Lovecraft, but this is really a throwaway."
positive,Hinge Pins Are Great: These are great for fixing your door easy to install they don't come with directions however. I recommend you check on line in the Chevy Blazer forum there you will find detailed instructions for installation they even have tips on how to make a simple tool to heip with the inserting the bushings. I found the info very helpful and saved me a lot of time and grief.
positive,AWESOME: This CD was well worth the wait. Clay has one of the best voices I have ever heard and it comes through loud and clear with every song on this CD. Buy it...you'll be happy you did.
negative,"Deceptive: This book professes to be for all people, but is in fact, just for the devoutly religious. I could not finish it because it was so faith based, it made me sick to my stomach. Maybe some people can just give over control of their lives to God, but I cannot. I don't think that the reason for anger is our sins, as the previous reviewer has written, but I do think this book is deceptive. Nowhere on the cover does it mention that this book will try to get you to give your anger over to God and let him take care of you, but that is exactly what this book tells you. It is a total waste of money."
negative,"Don't bother: Sentimental, shallow book about WWII vets. I agree with his assessment of the generation, however. Read Stephen Ambrose if you want good WWII books. This book is only selling because the author is a celebrity. Duh."
positive,"Clever and smart children's flick: I'm in my thirties and hooked on Disney films and just loved the way ""Stuart Little"" was a flawlessly drawn character and acted so well with the live actors. This is great family entertainment and is a must for your video collection."
negative,"Whatever you do, don't buy this book: Unfortunately, I have been forced to read this novel for my English class. It is extremely difficult due to the fact that the main characters haven't mastered a little thing we like to call language yet. Because Golding refuses to help the reader along with proper narration, the outcome is nothing short of a migrane. Just wanted to give all of you presently sane people out there a little warning before throwing all of that sanity away attempting to decipher meaning in this book."
negative,The Worst Vacuum Ever: this vacuum only picks up dirt when using the detached pieces. going over carpet it only pushes the dust and dirt. the proof s in the bagless container...there is nothing in it after vacuuming 15 minutes. you get what you pay for. dont expect much for sub $100. returning it at amazon is a pain...otherwise i would have done it already...dont buy it
positive,Saucepan: Very satisfied with the saucepan. Good quality materials. Farberware is a name you can trust.
positive,"Hilarious: Anyone who likes southpark will enjoy this movie. The creators of southpark have made another humorous production, starring themselves this time. True fans will note that Trey Parker does 2 of the voices from their animated series (Mr. Garrison and Cartman). This movie is always good for a laugh."
positive,Very Good Pickup: One of the move powerful vacuums that I have had in the past and I love the rewind of the cord. Great Price. Would recommend to anyone to buy this brand.
positive,"good value: this was my first ink purchase, for my first fountain pen.shopped around and realized this bottle had the best value for the buck.i'm pleased with the ink's performance, but don't really have enough experience to tell you that it's great. you can read other people's review for that one."
positive,"If you can't get past page 60...: I am a working screenwriter, and this is the only screenwriting book I recommend. Why? Most of the screenwriting books out there are very useful - for rewriting. This book actually gets you to complete the first draft - a huge hurdle for beginning writers. You probably won't finish in 21 days, and the draft you write probably won't be very good. But that doesn't matter, because you will finish a draft, and then you can rewrite it and make it good.I still use this book to clarify my thinking, or if I'm on a tight deadline."
positive,"Shoo Goo: My son, who is a skater, needed something to repair his favorite skate shoes, duct tape just didn't look good! He saw a video recommending Shoo Goo, it sounded like just the thing we needed to fix his shoes, so we tried it. It worked great, but I wish that I had chosen the clear, as I chose black and the result was less than I expected. I will definitely buy this product again, but I will choose clear instead of black!"
negative,excellent movie - poor quality: this movie with its magnificant cast and its thrilling story could be recommended like all films made by master-director Damiani - but I suffered when watching the story because they sent me a copy with a rather poor image-quality (like a view through strong softening lenses)...a pity..
negative,sucks: i just got one word this movie blows one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time the first part of the movie put my wife to sleep. any body who reads this it is not even take the time our the money to by this movie

negative,Horrible: Wow .. this is the worst book I've ever read!! I would NEVER ever tell anyone to read this! It's just so weird and BORING. Don't waste your money! AHH .. I hated this book with a passion!
negative,"Wiccan or not?: I'm not a fan of these films. I just don't ""get"" them. I suppose the writing is wonderful. The novels are as popular as air, I can't seem to get through those either. It seems these films render one in a trance, an unescapable one. I've never been drawn in. I WANT to be entertained by these films. I truly do. But this film does NOT! It's horrible. It's just too infantile. This film droned on for near to three hours. Even William Friedkin and Blatty edited ""Exorcist"" for the screen. A novel this long? Lord, I can't seem to find an escape from this boredom. The young adult love is nauseating at best. The ONLY good point to this film is it's set design. To compare this film to ""Wizard Of Oz"" is absurd. ""Oz"" cannot be compared to ""Hogbore""."
negative,"A bit dull.: ""Message From Home"" was the first of (so far) three albums by Pharoah Sanders produced by Bill Laswell and the first album by Sanders in quite a long time (I think since the '70s) to consist of all originals. It is not, unfortunately, very good.The album consists largely of synthesizer driven mid-tempo grooves well informed with percussion washes and fiery playing from Sanders. At its best, it proves pleasant enough (vocal chant-and-flute piece ""Kumba""), at worst it finds Sanders in drastic opposition to the music (ballad ""Nozipho"" finds Sanders overblowing and screeching against a soporific backdrop). It's not unlistenable, but its not the kind of record you'll be reaching for.Sanders and Laswell would succeed much more on their future efforts, this one is really pretty far from essential."
negative,"Very real, but VERY depressing!: Yes, this book was good in that it seemed to accurately portray the breakdown of a family when one of its members actually ""breaks down"".However, it is an extremely depressing book in that no one seems to get any better. Angie floats around, mostly in a paranoid state, in and out of hospitals, group homes and her own home. Luke leaves college, leaves his girlfriend, drifts around for a while, then gets back with his girlfriend and goes back home (doing what, I'm not sure - the book wasn't clear on that). Pieter keeps playing his cello and wallowing in self pity. And Jordana never fully copes or even comes to term with Angie's illness. She is also drifting.This may be reality, but it is an extremely depressing reality. I have read ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and loved it. This book is NOTHING like ""Cuckoo Nest""."
positive,"Nothing to write home about, but fun and zany.: Ok, the premise of the movie is pretty canned, and some ideas/montages downright dumb or silly, but the overallpresentation is a bit out of the box and humorous. The moviemoves at a brisk pace, and uses and lambasts a lot of cliches about marriage. One would think the comedy would be predictable, but it manages to create an off-beat edge that tickles. Supporting characters, including the older actors,keep things diverse or outright wacky. Zellweger brings a pouting charm while O'Donnell is pure naivety and his fat side-kick delivers some good laughs. Again, the movie is a success on it's own terms because of the brisk pace that stays consistently outrageous and doesn't get stuck in any plodding emotional exposition, sentimentality, or melodrama. Fun flick."
positive,"Great Love Story: This is the ultimate movie experience; they just don't make love stories like this anymore. I feel that William Shakespeare himself would have given the screen play five stars if he were alive today. This is not the original version of this movie but I feel that it is the most entertaining of the bunch. The costumes, the music, the surroundings all fit perfectly to accomplish a work of art. This would be the ideal movie to watch on a rainy night right in front of the fire place. I recommend it highly for those of you looking for the ultimate love Story."
positive,Great Resource: Eyewitness books always are a great resource when learning about a culture. This book has wonderful pictures and descriptions of the cultures found in Africa.
negative,"limitations of color printing: This printer works great for almost any application, but do not expect to print on special paper. On even the soft gloss paper, the ink blobs and gives poor quality printing. The color photos print better on regular paper than on photo or special finish paper. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING, you will be disappointed."
positive,"Not what I ordered, but I'll keep it!!!: I actually ordered the stand for the flute/piccolo, but got this one instead. Has extra pegs for the clarinet. I already have this one for my other daughter who plays flute/piccolo/clarinet. Wanted one for my daughter who plays oboe. Don't need the other pegs, but I'll keep it anyway. Gave it 4 stars only because they sent me the wrong one, but the actual product is superb!"
positive,"Good for its value: I bought the bed with the idea of using it during one week while my father was visiting. It fulfilled its purpose perfectly. It's comfortable, it inflates and deflates very quickly and it's pretty high. There are two reasons why I am not giving it a 5-star score: a) I used sheets and still, when I woke up, my back was sweating. I guess that it is a problem with all these beds that are made of plastic, but... that is a drawback. b) I haven't been able to fold it and fit it in the bag again, it's almost impossible.Anyway, overall, it's a great deal for its price. I would absolutely recommend it and the problems I pointed out are probably a problem in all air beds."
negative,"Not a good source for the NCE: I only studied with this book, and I passed, but I don't really attribute it to this study guide. Perhaps it was the version of the test I took, but out of the 200 questions, maybe 30 were covered in this study guide. This guide is chock full of names that you don't need to know (for the test) and it covers none of the DSM. The career section and the appraisal and research sections are not enough to be prepared for what's on the NCE. The other sections were fine though."""
negative,"Zero Stars.: Read the book. Robert Penn Warren's novelization of Great Depression-era Louisiana state politics has yet to be thoroughly, and now so much later cannot be, filmed.The Broderick Crawford film version could not incorporate the gratuitous and excessive profanity of the disastrous Sean Penn version.If viewing an All the King's Men is a personal compulsion, view the Broderick Crawford film, which, closer to the era and produced by staunch Hollywood professionals, does well.Read the book.Clint WilliamsOakland, Michigan USA"
positive,"Classic Peter Gabriel: This is a great CD with songs like Sledgehammer and Big Time, it is almost a classic now and you can't go wrong with this disc."
negative,"Do not buy REMANUFACTURED from this outlet!: I received a broken waffle maker. Sent it back, received another broken waffle maker. Both were broken due to poor packing. They both were broke in a place that could not be fixed to be operational.Save the headache and buy the newer Waring Pro PROFESSIONAL waffle maker with the fold down handle. If you shop around you can find one for about ten buck more than the remanufactured cleaper line for a much better waffle maker, and brand new! Would NOT recommend rebuilt on this item. Would give ZERO stars not one! Also bad customer service."
negative,"Patti Page attempts to sing jazz...: Unfortionately Miss Patti Page doesn't have the talent or chops to pull off a jazz session. Backed here by June Christy's regular orchestra, only shows how bad a singer Page is in comparison to the gifted Miss Christy. Miss Page doesn't have the syncopation, rhythm, or phrasing to attempt a project like this. Doris Day, Roseamry Clooney, and Tony Bennett are pop singers who can easily make the cross-over from pop to jazz, but talentless hacks like Patti Page, Teresa Brewer, and Johnny Mathis only make fools of them selves when trying. Stay awa yfrom this and just go out and buy any CD by Anita O'Day or June Christy, but for Heaven Sake's don't buy this."
positive,"Mom of lead singer and foster mom to band members!: Dynamite Album. This isn't even my kind of music, but It is great work. I can assure you that a lot of blood, sweat and tears went into making the album, writing the lyrics, and hours and hours went into the practice. These kids have been working for a few years to succeed, and I know they will. Maybe you think there is some prejudice here, but there isn't at all. Buy this album, you will really enjoy it."
positive,"A classic!: I first saw this when I was a kid. I still enjoy all of the fantastic actor portrails of so many historical figures as well as the not so famous. It's a little cleaner than the more modern ww2 movies, doesn't show all the blood & guts. Historically accurate."
negative,"My thoughts exactly!!: I, too, have the iPAQ (since August 1) and suffer from the misfortune of using NT at work. Compaq customer service has done a terrific job of skirting the issue whenever I call as to when the serial cradles will be available. I have orders in with several e-tailers for the serial cradle, and their delivery dates keep getting pushed out. What's going on? I'm seriously thinking about selling my iPAQ on eBay, I've heard it commands top dollar there. In the meantime, it makes for a sharp looking paperweight!"
negative,"Great swaddle for small babies but NOT a size large: This swaddle is wonderful-- when you purchase it in a size small/medium. However, after ordering the size large after my baby grew I received this swaddle in what was marked as size large. It is definitely not a large. The ""large"" is actually identical in size to the small/medium. I eventually spoke with the manufacturer about this and I was told that they are having production problems and currently are unable to produce a true size large of this swaddle. So don't order the size ""large"". This swaddle is wonderful though for a smaller baby (less than 15 pounds)"
positive,"enlightening: The broad scope of Phillips' latest work is stunning. The manner in which he draws on historical parallels of earlier global hegemons to the contemporary US is enlightening and even a bit disturbing. The same can be said of his extensive description of the role religion, especially protestant fundamentalism in the South, has played and continues to play ever more so in American politics. This is the sort of book which will keep you awake at night thinking."
positive,"FICTION? I THINK NOT: I HAVE READ ALL MEDIA EXPOSED IDEAS OF THE STORY OF MANSON AND HIS SO CALLED FAMILY.I JUDGE ALL AS HUMAN FIRST AND ALL OTHER THINGS ON CHARACTER.I NEVER BELIEVED THAT HE WAS A HIPPIE CULT LEADER,NOT THAT HE FORMED THIS FAMILY, AND BELIEVE HE KILLED NO ONE.THIS WAS JEERED BY MANSON HIMSELF BUT I BELIEVE THIS IS THE CLOSEST REVELATION TO EXPOSE THE WAY IT CAME ABOUT OUT OF THE MEDIA.1967, MANSON ASKED NOT TO GO TO SOCIETY.HE MET FEW INSTRUMENTAL PEOPLE HE HUNG OUT WITH. HE WAS SHY OF SEX. HE WAS IGNORANT AS TO HOW THINGS WERE. HE WAS INTO BING CROSBY, NOT BEATLES AND HELTER SKELTER.ONE OF THE GIRLS CREATED THAT BY HERSELF.IF IT HAD STAYED IN WHAT WAS HIS RELEASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN O.K. BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE JOINED THEM AND THE LOVE AND PEACE ERA, REVOLVED TO BIKERS, WEAPONS ,THEFTS. THAT WAS NOT THE PLAN. TRYING TO KEEP UP EXSISTANCE, SOME PEOPLE DID NOT WANT TO STAY IN THE VALLEY. THEY BRANCHED OUT, BROUGHT OTHERS IN AND CHAOS EVOLVED."
positive,Beautiful microwave: This was a great deal and I rec'd it in 3 days even though it said it would take longer because of the super saver shipping. It is very classy looking and I especially love that the buttons are hidden. It goes great with my stainless steel refrigerator. I gave it 4 stars [...]
positive,"Worth the extra cost.: Get the Luxe...it is worth the extra money. Great product. I got it as a shower gift and didn't think that I would want it, so I keeped it in it's bag for a possible return. I had my baby and decided to give it a try first. He loves it. The fleece makes it that much more warm and inviting. Tried the standard boppy...it's fine but for a few dollars more it will make a impact in comfort. Good Luck."
positive,"A great start for Miss Hill: As her first solo album, I think that Lauryn Hill did an excellent job of catching the audience. I prefer the first songs on the album to the later ones, but that is because they are more upbeat and danceable."
negative,"Overpriced for basic information: This book is really full of common sense, but if you are new to web businesses, it may be of help but not worth the price tag.Mr. Rudl's website has several ""ANNOYING"" pop-ups that made me want to leave immediately.There are a lot of common sense themes in the book that can be found on any web-based business site, and a lot of the information is out-dated in my opinion.There is one good thing about the book though, and that's that it puts a lot of information together that would take a while to get on your own.In my opinion, Mr. Rudl is a good salesperson with good marketing skills. He makes his money by hawking his wares on his site, and it looks like he makes money by being an associate for other websites with ""featured"" products on his website.I don't recommend this ""book""."
positive,"Give the guy his props!: These reviewers are way off-base......if you are people who only like Rod's rock albums, then don't even bother reviewing this one because you can't be objective......I find this album to be a joy in reminding me why those songs were such big hits in their time! He picked a nice range of tracks and he delivers all very well and stays true to the originals while still adding his own spin! I do hope that after this release, he does need an album of all new material and no more cover albums.....that is my only gripe!"
positive,"Perfect for what I got it for!: I purchased this to place 2 paintball guns in. A tippman 98 custom & a tippman a5. They both fit on the bottom level just perfectly. Placed the Removable foam layer on top of that then placed the hoppers for both in the middle & 1 20oz. co2 cannister on each side of the hoppers. When I close the lid it's a little tight but the foam depresses after a few moments & releives a bit of the pressure & settles in quite nicely. Absoloutely perfect for this purpose. Can't really comment on durability at this point seeing as I still have it in storage in my basement now, but for $[...] with shipping included even if it lasts a few years to and from the paintball course & storage I would be glad to get another. It seems very sturdy, I haven't tried to test it much but when I got it & tried squishing it together with my hands from a few different angles, not really much movement so I'm happy as can be with the purchase. Would definitely reccomend this product."
positive,"dude's cool !: this guy is outstanding to say the least. Favorite actor , would be cool to meet him. His acting skills are second to none."
positive,"Comfortable, but needs insulation from cold: We purchased 2 of these for guests' use and they are quite comfortable. The pumps work relatively quickly and quietly, and allow for good firmness in the mattress. They also held air well and needed little additions over 2 weeks' time.Our only drawback was that the air doesn't provide insulation from cooler ambient air. We keep our home cooler at night, and a guest found it necessary to cover the mattress with a heavy blanket to insulate properly from the coolness. I would recommend a mattress pad or foam topper when using this to provide some extra warmth."
positive,"Holmes Fan Created: This is the book that got me interested in reading mystery novels. It's suspenseful, thought provoking, and totally unpredictable. I have yet to find another mystery that really adds up to what Doyle has created in these few pages. I want to read all his novels now, and I can't wait!"
negative,"Very Poor: I've been a fan for 25 years. I had a ticket to his Roseland cocnert, but I wasn't motivated to make the 5 hour trip. Today I listened again to Outside. Bowie, when he's good is so very good! When he's mundane, as on Hours, its passe to the max."
positive,"Cheap backup: There are fancier, lighter, more comfortable, more adjustable headlamps but this one puts out enough ligh to find your way in the dark and sooooo cheap"
positive,"Right, right.... Right, right: This was the best movie ever. people how say it was disterbing, and sick. They don't know what there talking about, I admit there was a couple nude scence but if you read the book it has it all. Kubrick was just tying to make it like the book. so people who say it was a bad movie they better watch it and get it this time. Just remember all that he did leads up to the end and how everything is so.....WATCH THE MOVIE TILL YOU GET IT AND IF YOU DONT GET WATCH WITH SOME ONE THAT WILL SO THEY CAN TELL YOU WHATS ABOUT!!!!"
negative,Cannot import to I-tunes-Screws up computer: Have been a Santana fan for 35 years. Buy all that Santana has to offer on the release date. But no more. This is trojan horse. Do your self a favor and avoid.
positive,"Squeeeeeze into your clothes: I really liked the Squeem. I'm a petite person, but have some love handles that I need to hide when I'm wearing tight clothes. The only problem is that it has boning which you feel in your ribs when it's tight."
positive,"Awesome Knife: This knife was everything i expected and more. This is one of the greatest all around knives i have ever seen. It is super strong, has a great wieght and balance, and of course it keeps a great edge... it is a benchmade. I highly recommend this knife to any outdoorsman, hunter, even our beloved soldiers in all of our armed forces. This knife will withstand most anything, and stay sharp with just a little TLC."
positive,"reviews from ""Gramophone"" and ""American Record Guide"": &#65279;1. Review by Timothy Lovelace, American Record Guide, March-April 1997""This disc is notable for the gorgeous voice of Marjorie Patterson and the charming songs of the young Spohr...Patterson is an impressive advocate. She varies strophes imaginatively, her diction is clear, and her voice is opulent...I recommend this release to all singers looking for neglected gems.""2. Review by &#65279;John Warrack, Gramophone, February 1997""With one of Goethe's most famous lyrics, Mignon's ""Kennst du das Land"", genius was not burning at its brightest with eitherBeethoven, Schubert or Schumann, and though the dramatic power of Wolf's great song was hardly at Spohr's command, he did make a fine, strong, perceptive setting that deserves much wider currency. Marjorie Patterson and Daniel Sarge perform it with the conviction it deserves; they are an excellent Lieder duo, with the intelligence to sense the expressive weightof each song."""
positive,"Deeper: Go Deliriou5?!!!! This album is definitely for those who want to go deeper. I never tire of listening to this album or the ""Cutting Edge"" CDs! They are so anointed and powerful! I love Deliriou5?"
negative,"Stopped playing cd-r/rw: After reading the other reviews all I need to put down is:First week it played my mp3 cd-r just fine.2nd week noticed it took longer to load up directory.3rd week it won't play any cd-r/rw disks ( mp3 or cd-da ) and it has problems with store bought cd's.Someone said you get what you pay for, actually a $20 mp3 player hooked up to speakers would be alot better than this...and it would show you the name of the track your playing.This is junk, dont buy it. On top of that they don't say what the limits are on the media your trying to play ( memory size, max # of tracks, etc ),"
positive,ROTC cadet rates top book: I am an Army ROTC cadet and will soon be an officer. This is absolutely the best book I have read concerning the science of warfare and the art of leadership. I highly recommend it to anyone charged with the responsibility of the nation and the populace.
positive,"....all can enjoy: ""Down a black hole"" if it's for Britney Spears or 'N Sync;still slightly crazy but mollifying and understandable if it's Ella Fitzgerald. Like Billie Holiday, another great musician, Ella overcame her harsh childhood to become the ""First Lady of Song,"" her tender and buoyant voice a celebration of soul and the frailities and losses that life inevitably tosses. With classics such as ""Lady Be Good,"" ""Miss Otis Regrets,"" and ""How High the Moon,"" as well as my personal favorite, ""Love Is Here to Stay,"" this box set is the ultimate Ella Fitzgerald collection. While Spears and etc. won't be remembered beyond the next five years, Fitzgerald will still be singing for every color and class, and continue well into the next millenium."
negative,"For older kids: I got this for my son and he had such a hard time getting the 4 wheels on the floor at the same time that I had to make a hole on the dogs body to place the stick handle directly there. This helped him a lot.The toy is very durable and cute... don't know, have mixed emotions about it"
negative,"Fiction and reality blurred: The movie was not the best effort by Robert Englund or Wes Craven. They did a good job at blurring fiction and reality, but all in all a disappointment. As I watched this movie I thought to myself, why is Wes Craven so famous for? Sure he's made two classic movies- Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream but thats about all. I love Wishmaster, but im sure people dont even remember it. Last House on the Left was bad or at least I thought so. The last three or four movies he's done has been flops. So why is Wes Craven so popular? He really hasnt done much. Come on, I know there is a reviewer out there dying to answer this."
negative,battery missing!!!!!!: The main reason I ordered this kit was for the battery. When I received it ....NO BATTERY included. I contacted Amazon and all they could do was give me a number for Sony customer service. Thanks Amazon!!!
negative,"Falls Apart Constantly: This item is horrible. It falls apart constantly. We tried hot gluing and superglue, however, NOTHING works. Even our 4-1/2 YR son has told us to throw this out he is so frustrated. The tower on this item is so high it continuously falls off.Part of appeal was you can take Imaginext items & reconfigure them, great concept. However, no matter how you configure them, they ALL fall apart.During assembly notice they do not ""click"" as you would expect. Pieces never lock together, even with the bottom ""base"" pieces.We resorted to putting all the Imaginext on a table for him to play, however, flat surface, bumpy surface, any surface, it falls apart.(...)When a 4-1/2 YR wants you to throw out his toys, somethings wrong!"
negative,"pretentious garbage: i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages. i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign. i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something. the impression i instantly got was ""BEEP BEEP! PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."" guess what, mr. sedaris? i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood. millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card. check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style."
positive,"TIMELESS CLASSIC: This is a perfect novel written in a unique way to appeal to youngsters and adults alike. I recall reading it many many years ago as a young teenager and being totally enthralled with the plot and the action. Re-read again as a young adult and recall being struck by the outmoded science, but very appreciative of the characters and humorous aspects. Now, having read this a third time, I can realize that its a great blend of plot, action, humor, with a satisfying ending. I will get my young son, a teenager, to try it and hope to take great satisfaction if he enjoys it as much as me..."
positive,"Rememberances: I knew Richard Bradford when he was just out of Tulane University and I was married to one of his best friends. He claims this book not to be autobiographical but there are some similarities and I cannot help but believe that some of the adventures of he and Steenie are based on his friendship with my husband. The book is a masterpiece and I have read it often since it was first published in 1968. His second book ""So Far from Heaven"" is just as clever and regrettably impossible to find. ""Red Sky at Morning"" remains a classic."
negative,"It was good while it lasted...: The device worked wonderfully when it worked. Unfortunately for myself, it died after only two weeks of light use. Your mileage may vary."
positive,"Fun and simple game.: This is a great game, for four or five people. Moves along and is simple to understand."
positive,"Fulfillment!: Having just finished book 6 ""The Sorcerer"" I feel totally sated as though I've eaten a very rich chocolate mousse to finish off a banquet of many courses. Jack Whytes very plausible explanations of the""sword in the stone"" tale and other of his rounding off of characters is brilliant.I've still got book 7 to get but maybe a short pause to digest the previous books will be in order and I'll save ""Uther"" for another day."
negative,"Worst Alternate Idea: This is the latest in the stargate movies, the plot is that the stargate has captured their most dangerous enemy and they are preparing the trial for the crimes committed, however he tells things will change, somehow he manages to change the time when the stargate was not found and the team was not formed as we all know.While the idea is very good, I'm sorry to say the movie was profoundly very tedious, not as exciting as I hoped. So if you want alternate universes please check Star Trek Deep Space Nine or the books in which the idea is used.As this movie Sorry Stargate fans it is not worth it."
positive,"one of the best war movies ever made: darryl f. zanack spent years of his life and his own money to bring this tale of the biggest invasion ever mounted, the operation overlord,d-day. with an all star cast and the best battle scenes ever put on film this is one that is a must for war film buffs and good movie buffs everywhere.while grand in scope it never loses sight of the little personal moments that happen during war. just one of the finest examples of film making you will find,a must for every collection of good movies."
negative,"Shelters, Shmelters: Call this Stone Soup: This book is MADE of stone--and prehistoric conversation. Endless and infuriating recapitulations, a lethargic pace, non-plot, characters with not a whit of life to them, useless, tedious, drawn-out descriptions of rocks and topography, and worst of all, dialogue that would disgrace one of those softcover books that fifth-graders buy in school. Have I left anything out? I wonder if Jean Auel ever did have anything to offer besides earnestness and a certain tempo. ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" has been blown up with helium four times, each time with less and less content and more and more pages. I have read every page she's written up to now and I feel foolish for having done so."
negative,NO Help: This book did not help me with my economics class. Even though I passed the course with a B. This book reads more like a novel and really does not simplify economics at all. I work better with definitions and examples and this book gives none.
positive,"Addicting: The more I listen to music by Matthew West, the more I want to see and hear everything he's putting out. Undecided? Look for his videos on YouTube. Especially ""Motions."" I think you'll want to own everything he's putting out. What a refreshing change from Christian music that just wants to sound hip. Matthew makes you think."
positive,Actually 4.5: A Japanese-born duo relocated to New York and christened with an Italian band name. Their surreal narratives sung in a combination of French and broken English may not be for those fans of J-Pop groups. I have seen this group emerge since 1994 since their first release Viva! La Woman in 1996 ... this is when I immediately started to buy their releasing albums. We should be thankful we have an imported talent from Japan signed to Warner Bros.
positive,"Gladiator ROCKS: One of the greatest movies ever produced. Excellent Cinematography, Directing, Editing, and last but not least, acting! A subpurb performance by Crowe. Epic in every way. Watch this movie!! Buy it for your library. This movie is not for children!! It has brutal violence. Sgt Bob rates this as a FIVE STAR movie!!"
negative,I wouldn't buy it.: Length:: 1:13 MinsIn this video you can hear the First Act MG409 being played followed by a review.
positive,great quality: Nice drill set. We like the fact that the register locks closed and we don't have to worry about them falling out and getting lost.
negative,Not funny at all..it's awful jsut awful: Bad as bad gets. The film is not funny at all not one bit funny not at all. The film iss o bad you wanna shut it off from the first bad joke to the next. I dont know how I made it through the whole film. The jokes are lame and not funny there so bad your laughing becosue the movie is terrable. Overall one of 2006 worse movies.
positive,Not a pool toy: I got this for the kids and they have a great time throwing it at each other and the pets. They put it in the pool and now I have to deal with some angry things from the center of the earth. Oh well the kids did have fun.
negative,"They really don't hold a charge very well: I have a lot of different NiMH batteries. Some from major battery companies, others from the off brands. Some are five years old. These are maybe six months old. These loose their charge (resting discharge) faster than any of the other batteries that I have. They are almost unusable because of this. If I take them from the charger they are good for a couple of hours of use in my Powershot camera. If I wait two weeks, the camera says change batteries immediately. I have done the discharge/recharge cycle, but it hasn't helped.As an alternative, I have recently gotten several of the ready to use (R2U) slow discharge NiMH. These seem to be much better than all of the rest of my NiMH batteries."
positive,Great value!: This caliper works great! Love that it comes with a hard case and extra battery. It has been very accurate for me and so much easier than trying to read a standard caliper. You will not be disappointed!
negative,"Not Sleeping Beauty: I bought this book because I thought it would be similar to her ""Sleeping Beauty"" series. It isn't even close. This is more romance novel than BDSM, and even then the romance is a little cheesy.If you want a romance novel, go ahead and get this book. If you are looking for good BDSM, look elsewhere."
positive,"This one is a keeper: My daughter received this last year for Christmas when she was 7 months old. She loved it!! She would stick her face down in the bowl to see the lights and ""fish"" rolling around. Now at 17 months she still enjoys the music, and loves to dance to it."
negative,"Where is the widescreen?: It's September 2006, and they *still* have not released a widescreen version. I got through the first 20 minutes of this pan-and-scan version before I couldn't stand it anymore. There are so many beautiful shots; I just can't watch them butchered like this.Roxanne is a great movie, and it deserves more than this poorly rendered DVD version."
positive,Works as advertised: The Apricorn EZ-Up-Universal worked just as advertised. I was able to copy the contents of a netbook's hard drive and upgrade it to a 500GB hard drive with no problem. And now the old hard drive stays in the external case for use as a portable backup drive. Excellent solution!
negative,"Could have been better: This is definitely not Murdock's best. Some of his books are excellent (eg., 7 Laws You must Honor to Have Uncommon Success) and some of them appear to be just pamphlets taken out of the Biblical text designed more to raise funds than to inspire with original insight into the scriptures. This book is typical of that type. One would be better off just reading the original source than reading Murdock's rehash in this one."
negative,Daughter of time: the book is very boring for my taste but its essential for what you may have to study for the class.
negative,"worst book i have ever read in my life(and i read lots!!!): i thought this was the most boring uninteresting book i was ever fourced to read in enlish class, if it were up to me it wouldnt even get one star!!!!!!! If you are lucky enugh to have to option of not reading this book, u should take advantage of it"
negative,Not comfortable and dangerous for a toddler!: I bought this bed an year ago but after the second night he slept on it I decided it was not safe for him.The bed is way too small for a toddler specially if he moves a lot during sleep.The sides of the bed are very hard and he can hurt his arms on even his head if he bangs on either side of the bed.I am wondering if this bed even follow Association's standards for safety.My advise: spend some more money and buy a safer bed!
negative,"The memory lives on.: This novel revives memories of an excellent BBC radio play in the early 1960's and long had I searched for the book. After reading this work my impression, even after many years, is that the radio play was far superior, and I am left disappointed."
negative,A nightmare!: I rented this poor excuse for a movie and couldn't help falling asleep the whole time. It's pretty predictable and not very entertaining. It's not really worth buying.
negative,"Zoo Tycoon: Loaded fine but then couldn't get it to run. Couldn't even get back to a spot where I could get the unique product number. As it turned out, MS doesn't tell you that if you are running a newer version of XP (post Sep 2002, SP1) you have to buy a codec, online, from a thrid party company. For $14.95 additional you can get the game to work on your XP system. MS support was no help. I was very upset and will return to the store I bought it from, Staples."
negative,"A waste of time: I loved ""Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas"" and was hoping that Mr. Patterson would again engage me in a really good story, even if it brought me to tears. That didn't happen here. Instead, I found this book filled with every possible cliche and circumstance, as tho he'd created a list of every imaginable sad scenario, and checked them off as he worked them into this novel. Young, beautiful woman widowed....then a miscarriage...now a beloved grandmother in a coma, with her own life's story to tell via letters....and then a new boyfriend dying of cancer. C'mon! It is so far beneath his talents for a good story, that I can't imagine why he would take the time to write it......unless he simply enjoys laughing all the way to the bank. I read it in less than 2 hours...hoping that he would redeem himself and make it worth my while. Didn't happen."
positive,Gods and Kinga: We are currently studying 1&2 Kings in our Bible Study. I bought this book for a friend for Christmas and she has already finished it and passed it on to me. I started it and have trouble putting it down. It gives an added dimension to what we are studying.
negative,"Stereotypical Witches: This is the worst example of stereotyping of witches I've ever seen. It should be renamed ""4 Hours of ads for BAD Witch Movies."" All the depictions of witches in this video are so negative that it definitely leads one to believe that all the bad publicity given to witches is justified."
positive,"Captures a certain amount of Zeitgeist: Disclaimer: this is not my usual genre of music, inasmuch as I prefer rock and adult contemporary. After hearing the appetizer ""Cobrastyle"" as a current staple of the alternative radio realm, I was anxious to see the full menu. I also heard an interview of the three core band members from Stockholm about 3 weeks ago.The album is an eclectic mix of techno pop, shining brightest when showcasing the irresistible thumping dance rhythms. The overall experience brought back a certain frenetic dance energy I haven't felt in over 10 years. Overall, I am very glad I bought it. I expect it will be a hit at any party. Turn the volume up and let loose!The highlights for me are ""Cobrastyle"", ""Different Sound"", and ""Little Stereo."""
positive,Best Pop Album - Best Male Vocalist: Ignore the people who say that he should have sung more adult songs. These are ADULT songs. I appreciate the tone of the album. I'm glad that the CD is filled with new material. IT'S GREAT!!! I think the album has the ability to appeal to all ages if you have an open mind. It's not bubblegum music. IT'S THE REAL DEAL!THIS CD SHOWCASES CLAY'S VOICE IN WAYS THAT I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED. His voice is so flexible and it's evident with the song selection.Don't listen to the people who complain and whine about the song selection. It's terrific.BUY CLAY'S CD. YOU'LL LOVE IT.
positive,"Rivetting, yet the ""happy ending"" must come next book: In typical O'Brian fashion, the current state of our heroes is reversed in this book. Here we find Aubrey on the downgrade, while Maturin is repairing the damage done him in the previous episode. Certainly a rivetting story that is a pleasure to read, yet the real ""happy ending"" is left 'til the next installment (we hope!) For those looking solely for naval action, this book is not the best of series. Most of the plot involves Aubrey's difficulties on land and admiralty politics. Personally, I couldn't put it down and am yearning for the next installment"
positive,"Classic Hollywood, I do agree: I saw some of the other (negative) reviews on this movie, and I think they're missing the point. I wasn't very interested in the individual acting performances, as much as I was in the story itself. I haven't been able to find many movies that were done in the WWII setting as this one was, so that was a unique, refreshing perspective in and of itself.The ""Romance"" element is essential to any war story, so putting it up front in the movie set the tone for everything else, to me. Even the conflict caused by Liam Neeson's character, which showed some humanity within the borders of 1940's Germany, was a nice change from the expected ruthlessness that's typical in these settings.I'm obviously not a professional critic. Not even close. I'm a typical guy that likes good movies and good stories. I didn't even know that this movie was based on a novel. I don't wanna know. All I know is that the movie works for me."
positive,"Pretty good at OOP and NN: This book does give a good introduction to programming neural networks in C++. The author has a good grasp of object oriented design and he shows how to exploit this in the construction of certain kinds of neural networks. The code in the book is flexable and fairly well laid out. I was able to port it to Java with relatively few alterations.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in starting to program neural nets. It probably requires a little background in C++, but the primer in the beginning of the book actually taught me something (I read this book a year ago when I was fairly new to OOP)!"
negative,Problem with my order: I really like the movie because of the music--I have seen it before--the picture on this tape was ok--though it has a couple of skips in it--the big problem is the audio--it is really low--I have to have my tv on full volume to almost hear it. I did not complain because I'm sure it is not your fault--you just sell the merchandise that is provided to you. The ordering went smooth and I received it promptly.
negative,Wrong: As an ex-protestant seminarian and now a Catholic priest I know how wrong Boettner is first hand. This kind of pseudo-intellectual tripe never impressed me. Read the Catechism to find out what we really believe.
positive,"""A World Within a World"": ""A World Within a World"" says it all. This is probably the best CD I own. I absolutly LOVE silverchair, I have been a fan since they first came out with ""Tomorrow"". This CD just proves how diverse and talented they are. Daniel Johns (lead singer) has such a beautiful and magestic voice.It definitely makes all troubles go away by just listening to it. It is soooo great to hear these bright and happy lyrics. I am looking forward to hearing much more from them."
positive,"Still a Classic!: Pinocchio was great back when I was a kid in the Bronx, NY and it's still a classic when I'm 64!"
negative,"Really, how is a movie like this sold to anyone?: It's a blatant ripoff of Predators and not even a good one at that. It has the feel of a movie made in someone's backyard. I feel bad for Sorbo and Woodbine. They once had careers, but now they're doing homemade movies for some Garcia kid down the street."
positive,"One woman's story - a quick, fun read: All of the 1 star people need to take a BREAK! This book hasn't changed my life, but it was an interesting take on someone setting a goal and meeting it - however arbitrary and supposedly trivial. The book is one woman's perspective, and if you don't like it, you won't like this book - just as with any book. She talks about being strongly opinionated politically, flipping out on her loving husband, and having a grubby kitchen - things many of us have done in one way or another. She describes how setting a goal related to something in life that she loves, rather than the job she is compensated for, frustrates and fulfills her. She finds her interests and talents later in life. Yes, she drinks, curses, and mocks strange and delusional suggestions related to the events of 9/11. She is not an insensitive, evil bitch - she is funny, irreverent, and has written a very funny book that is a quick and enjoyable summer read. Loved it!"
negative,"does NOT attach to a wall: I wanted to put some sort of full spectrum light over or beside my african grey parrot's cage. I bought this particular Ott light because it mentioned in the product description( in fact, in three places) that the lamp could be attached to a wall.It cannot be attached to a wall unless you want the light to face straight up. There is a keyhole type hole in the base of the light for a screw to attach it to the wall, but it is in the wrong place, and there is no way to change it. Wish I had known that, I would have bought some other type of light. Customer Service got back to my query right away, but said that they did not advertise using the light by attaching it to a wall. Hope they remove that part of their manufacturer's description. Otherwise, the light is bright and the fixture is good looking, it just can't be attached to a wall."
negative,"I waited *how* long for THIS??: What a disappointment. As an avid ""Earth's Children"" series reader, I waited with breathless anticipation for this next book. Basically ""The Shelters of Stone"" can be summed up as a rehash of previous books, absolutely no plot and no lead-in to the next book. Haven't been this disappointed since ""Star Wars: Episode One."" Nuff said!"
positive,"A wild ride: This movie blew me away the first time I seen this movie. I wish it were 20-30 mins longer to for more story.I have wanted part 2 for years now but sadly I am still waiting. I purchased this movie on DVD then HD-DVD. When HD-DVD was put to rest, I was upset because I knew I would not be using that player for long. I broke down and purchase the Bluray for another high def version.I am glad to say I am not disappointed."
negative,"Terrible: Its just another hormonal teen movie centured around sex and drugs. This movie lacks intelligence, and the plot doesn't flow well.Two friends are dating, and one day on the date of the twins girlfriends birthday, they lose thier car. Thinking that the twin have some sex in store for them, they go on an adventure to find their car. Memories are lost because of the'r wild night before. While on the way, they get thrown into another stupid plot, to find a machine for a group of women who plan to give them erotic plasure if they bring it to them.My best advice is to stay away from this ignorant picture."
negative,"Keyboard - Great ; Mouse - Bad: They keyboard is great. After successfully installing and connecting it to the computer, it works like a champ. However, I would do something about the icons on the keyboard. They aren't always easy to interpret quickly.The mouse is another story. I could never get it to install via PS/2. Plus, even if I had, the shape is not comfortable, as in the center front of the mouse, the shape rises to a high peak. Really high, and forcing my fingers to feel like they're curling down."
positive,"Wonderful Movie: If you love the original Night of the Living Dead, get this. The dawn of the dead remake recently made was fantastic, and this movie is just as good as that. Basically, this movie has the same plot and characters as the original. The cast is wonderful. Tony Todd is perfect. He is like Duane Jones, just with a deeper voice to make things sound cooler.There are some things changed in the plot which, in my opinion, improve upon the original. The ending, for example, is different. It is perfectly done though.If you like zombie movies, get this. You won't be dissapointed."
positive,"Backgammon Attache: This backgammon set is beautiful and if you like backgammon, then it is a great addition to your game repitoire and worth the value."
negative,"If all you want is yoga positions this video is for you...: I was disappointed in this video. I was looking forward to doing a routine with my 5+ year old and trying to start her on self-regulatory techniques. The video merely did a well-paced run through of various poses, but gave no structure or routine to follow. Most disappointing."
positive,"Creative and Inspiring: I loved this book, but when I got ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand"" I was surprised to find ""Making Journals by Hand"" is actually included in that text in full: word for word, page for page, project for project .Instead of buying ""Making Journals by Hand"" and ""Making Memory Boxes"", save some money and buy one book: ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand"". This book combines all of the projects above and then some.All of these books have great projects and instructions."
negative,"So Corny.: First, I want to say I watched the entire season and have seen the entire series. This season was pitiful There were points that you laugh out loud from it being so stupid and corny. Nobody acts like they do and Jamie's character which was good in the 5th and 6th seasons has become stupid. The show isn't the same without Lucas and Peyton, it's just dumb. The writing is just terrible, worst show of the year. I've never seen anything so corny. The new characters are ok, but this show shouldn't be surviving without Lucas and Peyton because it is so pointless and stupid without them. Even without them, it's too bad the writers and producers couldn't make it interesting and dramatic. Instead it's full of games, messes, snowball fights, and stupidity. Don't waste your time or money. Try some of the shows like 90210, Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, and others which would be way more worth your time and money."
positive,"Better than swiffer: I have had no problems with swiveling the mop head, as another review had suggested. It does a fantastic job of dry mopping the kitchen floors, and wet mopping worked extremely well. Just some generic pine-scented cleaner, hot water, and the mop pad. When I'm done, I just toss the mop pad in the wash with the towels and it's ready to use again. Great for the environment and great for your wallet."
negative,ARE YOU PEOPLE ALL DEAF OR ON DRUGS?????: The only song that sounds decent on here is Heart of Glass but the guys should sing on it like on the album. Call Me is a mess. Clem Burke is still an awesome drummer- one of the best- but even he can't always save this ensemble. I have seen them twice live and both times I was disappointed. They should make more of an effort to sound like the albums. I was a kid in the 70's and 80's and never saw them back then... but Deborah Harry's voice just isn't strong anymore. I like the fact that they got back together but if I'm being honest they just aren't that great anymore. And they would be more interesting to watch if they really reunited and brought back Nigel Harrison and Frank Infante and not have these stand-ins. Jimmy Destri seems to have suddenly stopped touring with them too.
negative,"Cant get A Real Dog: Sorry - I just dont get it and apparently neither does my nephew.When did building fake amusement parks, fake neighborhoods, fake families and scratching the head of a digital pet - become a substitute for real life interaction.My nephew wanted it and I bought it for Christmas. What a waste (even he thinks so).The upside, there's no hair to clean up, no walking when its cold and oh yeah - there's also no real love either - and isnt that why we have pets for our children?!This is about as stupid as Viva Pinata - a game where you somehow lure pinatas to live in your fake digital world. So that they can grow up to be big and strong?Here's an idea - let the kids outside to play once in awhile - and get them a real Pet! Maybe the people inside the house are more crazy than the crazy people you think you are sheltering your children from by not letting them play outside..."
negative,Didn't work for me: I bought this because I heard tea tree oil may be effective at stopping dandruff and scalp itch. It did not work for me. It actually made my itching worse and my scalp flake more. Perhaps it was the carrier oil in this solution or that there was not a high enough concentration of tea tree oil.I have found that Kera Care scalp conditioner with salicylic acid is working better for me to control flakes although unfortunately the itchiness is about the same.
positive,First rate movie and HD treatment: Awesome HD makeover for a top notch action flick = placement on my HD DVD library shelf at home.
negative,"Terrible read. I do not recommend it.: I wanted to start reading this because of all the good reviews, but it was terrible. The name of the author is not put there. One dimensional characters, no plot, contradicts itself over, and over. This god character makes no sense. Contradicts modern science. It's just terrible, it promotes genocide, slavery, killing, killing, and more killing, hate, and bigotry. It's a waste of 10 dollars that you could otherwise be buying a better book."
negative,"It was boring: This book was so boring that I couldn't even get past the third chapter. Like many people before me, I was drawn in by the cover art, but the book itself isn't worth reading. I couldn't connect with the hero of the story at all, and...well, I couldn't really connect with any of the characters. I don't want to sound rude, but the author himself seems a bit egocentric....If he wants to create the next 'big' fantasy series, then he could at least come up with some original ideas. A story's charm lies in its content, not in however old the author was when he wrote the thing. Paolini may use his age as a selling tool, but I know of 13-year-old authors who have written better books than this."
negative,NOT HIS BEST: I JUST FINISH READING THIS BOOK AND I HAVE READ BETTER BUT I GUESS IT IS OKAY SINCE IT CAME OUT IN THE 50'S BUT I EXPECT BETTER FROM GOLDING THE BEGINING OF THE BOOK WAS SLOW AND NOT TO THE POINT SOME OF THE CHARATER WERE GREAT AND OTHER NOT SO GREAT THE ENDING WAS THE BEST PART OF THE BOOK BUT TILL YOU GOT TO IT IT WAS NOT WORTH READING I HAVE READ SOME OF HIS OTHER BOOK AND THEY WERE GREAT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPEN TO THIS ONE CAUSE THIS WAS NOT HIS BEST WORK THE PART ABOUT sIMON DIEING I DID NOT GET AND I READ IT FIVEW TIME AND STILL GET IT AND NEVER WILL GET THERE WAS OTHER PART I DIDN'T GET BUT IT WOULD TAKE ALDAY TO TELL THBEM I HOPE YOU READ OTHER HE WROTE BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT HIS BEST
negative,"Only read it if it's assigned schoolwork: I didn't know it at the time this was assigned to me, but I was bound to hate this book. Correctly called an existentialist masterpiece, the book runs in circles. You cannot identify with this character because he is so detached from his existence. The only 'moral lesson' to be had seems to say that existence has no objective meaning, only that which you give it (an existentialist tenet) and if you give it no meaning, it doesn't matter any way (point of the book).As an Objectivist, I just can't identify with or support that in any way. The book gets 2 stars because Camus' use of language is wonderful, but it is a talent wasted on a pointless book. If you want to read a book with purpose instead, pick up Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Although her use of language is not as fluid, the themes of her books make much more sense."
positive,"Awesome headphones: Clear, crisp sound. Superior base. Sound not distorted when you use the noise-reduction feature. Works great on the plane as well as kicking back in the living room. I did a lot of research before buying these for my husband who was ready to graduate to something high end. I tend to agree with others that the Bose have a great ad campaign, but the headphones themselves don't compare to these. Also, they're lightweight and not clunky to carry around. Comes with a travel case that fits snugly into his messenger bag."
negative,"I've been through 3!: Officially done with these machines. Despite descaling as recommended, I've had 3 machines fail in the last two years. I love the coffee, but Im over it!"
negative,Stupid: I bought these because I read a bunch of positive reviews but they really suck! They look like little pieces of tape and they barely remove any hair. I don't recommend this product to anyone.
positive,"Moonstruck: Fabulous movie, can watch it over and over. Received quickly and as described. Love it love it love it"
positive,Fahrenheit 451 was a good book but hard to follow: I give Fahrenheit 451 41/2 stars because the ook keeps the reader on edge. I had a very hard time putting the book down. Fahrenheit 451 was a lot like our socity today. Instead of putting out fires firemen started them. That strange twist was what I liked most about the book. I deducted a half star because it was a little hard to follow.
negative,"Mediocre: I have been reading Moorcock's work ever since I encountered his creations while playing RPGs in the early Nineties. Suffice it to say, Moorcock seems to have nothing more to add to his Chaos-spawned mythology other than an obviously mediocre book. Old hands will probably notice the allusions to the Eternal Champion, a concept which in all the circumlocutions ,Alas! almost put him at par with those lame ""formula writers"". His Blood just fails to churn mine."
positive,"Another gem in my collection: This album was quirky enough for me to pick up and love to listen to!How would I compare this....hmmmm....I would probably say she is more like Tracy Bonham than anything. But PowerPop? I wouldn't go that far. She is NOT Aqua (or is that quirky powerpop?) or the spice girls.This is rather laid back kind of music, good stuff. It's the kind of stuff you'd listen to in a coffee shop. Good music, and a wonderful singer. The guitars are very good in this album as well, and I am looking forward to another release.My favorite tracks on this album have to be ""You Are the One"", ""People In This World"" and ""Big Three Wheeler"". ""People in this World"" has to be one of the heavier songs, along with ""Flyer"".If you like Tracy Bonham....(if you even know who she is, she did that amazing song, ""Behind Every Good Woman""), you'll probably like this album as well."
positive,"Funny: I'm surprised this movie was rated so recently, it was out in 1993 and rated 1999 and 2000, anyway. I saw this when it came out and saw it later, 7 years later to be exact. It was halarious, mostly the goombas, those tiny heads are so funny! It might have been better if things could be more like the game, but if it were it would probably lose alot in the translation, and like a contapositive of a statement means the same thing, the translation to movie and the translation of things like goombas, they even out for a pretty good movie. I now have a great urge to play Mario games, i saw it 1/2 hour ago. Too bad I won't be able to watch it again, I remember so little from the begining."
negative,"Garbage is exactly that......: I dont know what many people saw in this album, but i feel a rethink is due for. Appaling melodies, pathetic excuses for a beat. And the whining of some over privlaged rock stars who obviously feel as though they deserve more. Any attempt to throw in the odd tune is discarded for some strange attempt at ""art rock"" BORING"
negative,"waste of money!!!!!: Oh man, this is horrible! I'm a Lara junkie, and I'm completely embarassed by this horrid game. The PC controls are a joke, you just seem to spin in circles when you're just trying to make a simple turn. I feel completely ripped off by the folks at Eidos for releasing such a bug filled game. Game locks up at the worst possible moments, cut screnes are too long and dull, just let us play the game without the need to watch a movie every level...put all that energy into fixing the movement controls and lock up issues. Please, don't waste your hard earned cash on this!!! Maybe Eidos will get the message."
positive,These are great: I looked everywhere for this type of drapery ring that didn't cost a ton of money. I was thrilled when I found these. They are perfect!
negative,"WORST SPEAKERS EVER MADE: I Very disappointed whith this speakers I blowup all croosover, tweeters,do yourself a favor DON'T SPENT A DIME ON THIS CRAP, LOOK FOR A GOOD PAIR YAMAHA NS-1000M AND YOULL BE HAPPY FOREVER"
positive,"Excellent Compilation: This compilation of early (31-34) Calloway features excellent sound quality and a first-rate band backing up the King of Jive. At a great bargain price, this set is recommended for those who like their 30s swing served hot."
positive,"A Poetic Masterpiece: Jules Verne is one of the most captivating and poetic writers ever in existence. All of his novels are complete masterpieces, but this novel is the best one I have ever read. Its intricate plot line and complicated writing style make the novel seem both romantic and adventerous. Although for some the writing style may be too round-a-bout, I find it completely matches the story-line. The unusual adventure needs a writing syle to complement its exciting subtleness, and Jules Verne does just that. Read this from cover to cover and don't skip a word, because each and every one is of significance."
positive,"A well-lived life- Benjamin Franklin: The ""Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin"" is a story of one of the most fascinating and accomplished person who ever lived. Not only was he an accomplished politician (sounds like an oxymoron- accomplished politician, anyways I digress), he was a scientist, inventor, philanthrophist, etc.One important aspect of his autobiography we can benefit from is how he was able to become a better person despite being temperamental and foolish in his youthful years. He concentrated on overcoming one character flaw such as his temper and worked on it for a month. Then, he moved on to overcome another character flaw. He made minute but measurable progress to become an accomplished and fine individual.His autobiography should be read by all. It gives a glimpse at one of our great Americans.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, ""Nanay: Lessons From a Mother"""
positive,Simple Installation: I received and installed this last night on my kids 4 year old HP desktop. It is a replacement for the Buffalo wireless USB adapter the kids broke a couple of weeks ago. I wanted to get a replacement Buffalo product but found that a court injunction now bars Buffalo from selling many of their products in the US.I installed the Super G and it interfaced with the Buffalo router in 30 seconds. No problem at all. It even receives pretty good signals from 5 other wireless networks in my neighborhood. I am no computer geek but will say this product works like a charm with no dropped signals so far.
positive,"Excellant value: If you have to buy this individually at the auto parts store, it would cost much more. Mequiars is a good middle of the road car care product, cant go wrong."
negative,Mystery to Me: There is a maximum of 3 or 4 good songs on this album and it is generally recognized as being one of the Beatles' weakest. Anyone who thinks that all of the tracks are good needs to listen to some more music!
negative,"Warning - badly dubbed dvd: Prospective purchasers should note that this dvd is the dubbed version where American actors replace the Australian actors on the soundtrack. I understand that the decision to overdub the part was done when the movie was first released in the US (an Australian friend recalled his shock at the dubbing when he saw it in a US cinema at the time) but I would have thought that the studio could have dug up the original Australian version and released that instead. Because of this irritating and pointless feature of an otherwise fine movie (the best of the Mad Max series), I can only rate the dvd 2 stars."
negative,"Less then one year, Issues already: I purchased this less then one year ago, already the buttons are less responsive. The biggest problem that I have is that it does not play the songs correctly any more. I can hear the music and sometimes the back round singing but not the main singing. This started out as a periodic problem as I was running but now is almost all the time.I am very disappointed in this player."
positive,"Very good album: This is definitely worth coppin. Got some bumpin tracks. It contains a variety of songs, she is NOT one of them artist where all tracks sound the same. 15 tracks, and at least 10 of them are worth bumpin all the time. She has a music video for ""Still Buck"" too. You can download it from her labels website. HoodooLabs.com"
negative,"Waste of time: This book is advocating an elitist and pointless view of education. Bennett, has missed the core issues of what it means to be an educated person, especially in our every widening (global) society. Bennett advocates a people who are full of facts and ""trivia"" knowledge rather than pushing students to be critical thinkers who can solve problems, read with intelligence, and interact with the world from a stance of tolerance and intelligence. There is no ""yard stick"" that can measure intelligence. What rubbish. This book is designed to shame parents rather then educate anyone. Don't waste your time."
negative,"The worst movie ever made: Yeah, it sounds like a cheery holiday movie for the kids, but it isn't.It's mean-spirited movie that goes nowhere. It's crude and rude as you would expect from Sandler, but not even in a funny way. Imagine Sandler pushing a little old man in a port-a-potty down a hill so that he becomes a frozen sh*tsicle...then imagine reindeer coming to lick it off him and getting sh*t stuck in their teeth. Yup, that was in there and was about the extent of the humor therein.Please don't buy this. And if you do, BE SURE to watch this before giving it as a gift or letting your children watch it."
positive,"Good to add to the collection: This is a good book to read for beginners into Astrology. I was a little disappointed, because I've read most of the material on Astrodienst.com and from Liz Greene's Sun Signs book, which I highly recommend!!! Anywho, it's a good book to have, and I love Liz Greene, she's the best!"
positive,Satisfies through & through: WOW - WOW - WOW - WHOA... Hands down - GET THIS. Never did I expect the twist in this season. - Buy it.
negative,"Poor quality and inferior workmanship!: I purchased this pencil sharpener for my classroom, and have had problems with it from the first day. When you try to empty it, the back wall of the compartment falls off and is always a problem to put back together. It's also difficult to tell when it is full. Most of the electric pencil sharpeners I've gotten over the years at this price have lasted at least two years, and this one is now shot after only 5 months. I will never get this type again!"
positive,"Towering Characters in Exquisite Prose: Reading Walter Scott is a bittersweet experience, as we admire his adroit and nimble use of our English language, even as we mourn our modern-day loss of appreciation for such skill. His characters, as always, are credible and rich. His vivid depiction of the stormy King Richard stands among his best. Richard's Muslim healing sage ever speaks with quiet, fiery wisdom. Predictably, Kenneth the Scot is the true hero -- humble, strong, and bravehearted. Considering that the story is burdened with battles that almost happen, love affairs that never quite consummate, and mystical scenes that never truly resolve, this classic book nevertheless holds the reader captive throughout, and delivers a satisfying ending."
positive,LOVE IT!: This is going to be a quick and to the point review. Goregeous ring and flawless band. Very well made. It is the exact size as shown in the photo and is even prettier in natural light. Clear stone.
negative,"This is product is not a tutor: I purchased this product after all the wonderful reviews. This product is not a tutor. It ask questions and gives a short explanation of the answer, if you click on 'Explanation'. This product offers no tutoring at all."
positive,"Excellent Movie!: When you saw the previews for this movie, you probably did think it was a bunch of pretty woman dancing on a bar. It's NOT. It's a sweet story about a girl trying to seek her dream of being a songwriter. She needs to move to a new place to try to have her songs be heard, and ends up working as a coyote. Also with this tale is lots of fun and enjoyment. At the end, you can't forget when LeAnn Rimes comes in as a country music sensation (herself) and performs Violet's song she recorded. I highly suggest anyone should by this, and don't forget to pick up the soundtrack too!"
positive,"One of my favorites: I've always loved this movie. I watched Tora, Tora, Tora around December 7th and anytime I watch that I have to follow with Midway. Wish they left the Coral Sea part in. Could do without the son and his girlfriend drama. I'm glad they took out the girlfriend of Matt."
negative,"Initially interesting, eventually saw through him . . .: It was recommended to me by someone whom I think beleives in the interdimensional and non-ET aspect of it all. I kept an open mind, but finally came to the conclusion that John Keel wrote a fradualent and contrived story, with an underlying ""distracted"" attitude that in reality is quite insulting to the reader. The book is probably pure fiction, and if you seek more than fiction, then it is bordering on pure trash. As an ""investigator"" he poorly documents his findings. Don't buy it, check it out from the library, please."
negative,"Still have not received this after a month: I ordered this on Dec. 10th, 2011 and as of Jan. 11th, 2012 it still has not arrived. I wish someone would look into this and let me know what is going on."
positive,An abyss of special features!: All DVDs should be made as this one. James Cameron has brought us so many great films and this is one of them. This movie has one of the best punches captured on film when The Hammer knocks Michael Bein on his [rear] when he is attempting to choke Ed Harris with a chain.Definately get this DVD over all other versions!
positive,Drowning the sorrow in sweet song: All the world Ive seen before me passing by. wow. May i take a moment to say thanks for these words you sing. Today was my first time to have the pleasure of hearing song #9. I havent stopped since. Is it bad to listen to the same song over and over. i dont care. i could just get lost in my rage and pain thinking of all we lose each and every day. we may all be helpless in what happens in this world so accept it and let go of everything holding you back. peace
negative,"Haste makes waste: This was the first book I bought when I was learning how to write screenplays. I have a finished screenplay now, but this book was not at all helpful. In my opinion this book adds to the difficulty of writing a screenplay when there is a time factor. I would suggest a period of at least 2 months, most of the time going into planning. Who really cares about how quick you can write a screenplay, isn't the real goal to see how good you can write one? By the way of all the seminars by professional screenwriters that I've been to, I've brought this book up. None of them cared for it. Suggested instead was WRITING SCREENPLAYS THAT SELL by Michael Hauge, and after that Syd Field's books which go more into detail."
negative,"Of Mice and Men: This book is about two hobos named George and Lennie. In the beginning of the story they are on their way to a ranch to earn a stake. When they get to the ranch they meet Candy, the one handed man, Slim the team leader, Curly the bosses son, and Curly's wife. Curly is always loosen his wife and can't find her. She tries to flurred with all the guy at the ranch. Lennie is in the barn petting his dead puppy when she comes to flurred and then something happens! You'll have to read the book to find out what happens."
negative,"McMillan: Series was great but the disk, I believe disk 2 with the episode with Barbara McNair skips on both sides. Haven't had time to return the set. Hopefully the whole lot wasn't bad."
positive,"Excellent Book: It's unbelievable that this book has only received a four-starrating on Amazon. It makes me wonder if people Really know that thebook is very deep and so full of symbolism. At first glance, it may appear that this book is about a group of boys on an island, but if one truly analyzes it, they will notice more about it; the theme, characters, and plot are completely symbolic. I highly recommend this book because it has helped me to relate to life better."
positive,"One of the first Christian non-glam Metal bands: This album is pretty good, but as for Roger's new direction, he is now an atheist with a severe hatred for the Christianity he once preached. Which brings up the question of was he ever truly saved at all. And if he wasn't can this album truly be considered Christian? Some thoughts to wrestle with... On a strictly musical review this and Once Dead are great albums but after Roger kicked out, or had a falling out with the other band members the music suffered. If the pauses were taken out between the songs on Destruction Comes, (In which Roger plays all of the guitars as well as sings) you would seriously think it is all one long song. pretty sad."
positive,"Virile fusions: Before Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley songwriters picked up on Cuban and Puerto Rican styles in the pursuit of disposable novelty hits, these styles were being honestly fused with the emerging modern jazz of bebop and cool. Of course, this took place in New York City, as Machito and other emigres were welcomed by Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, and by dancers who no doubt wanted something hotter than intellectual bebop. The result is in these raw recordings, which are compositionally astute, blending Ellingtonian orchestrations with bop heads and the clave, while retaining and even magnifying the rhythmic intensity. Such a virile fusion of Latin and New York styles would not be heard again until the Nu Yorican movement of the 1970s."
positive,"A must for new puppy/dog owners!!!!!: I used to raise/sell Golden Retriever puppies, and this book I gave to my new owners for their own good. It's an easy read,and easy to understand. Margery West leaves out all the fluff, and gets to the meat of what you need to do, and what NOT to do to raise the model dog."
positive,"exquisite character development within an outrageous plot: I laughed so hard at the vivid descriptions that I had tears coming out of my eyes. All of the characters, their names, their qualities, what they said made perfect the hilarity of this wonderful story and all its eccentric charm. A tragedy it's out of print."
positive,"Lovely Stuff: If you like hard and fast punk rock, 3 simple chords, loads of energy, catchy lyrics and plenty of hatred, get into this. Classic punk rock/Oi. Not the best punk band ever, but very high up there. Grab it. Its full on. My only beef is that I am not into live recordings."
positive,"Amazing Book !: I was 16 when I came across this book. The title and Cover was the first thing that cought my eye. I have read this book many times and it is absolutly without a doubt amazing. I loved every single page of it. It is one of my all time favorite books and I have never found anything that I have liked as much. I have read alot of reviews on this book that were negative, and can not understand why readers bash it. After reading this wonderful book, I am left with two new bestfriends, that left the book and are with me. There are not enough words to describe how great this book is. I hope more people decided to read it and pass it along to someone else, who has enjoyed it as much as I have."
positive,"Antigone: Anoulih's version of Antigone was adapted for the time in which he lived. It contains hidden symbols to, at the time, both get the book past the censors and give the french audience moral and courage to stand up to the Nazi's and follow their beliefs. The characters are adapted slightly to fit his version, ie Tieresas is left out and a nurse is introduced. He also had to adapt the personalities of the characters, for instance Antigone develops a whiny habit, and Creon is seen as a ""good guy"". This was also done in order to get the play by the sensors. It is a well-written play with rounder characters than the original. This version would be better read after reading the original."
positive,hilarious: anyone who loves michael j fox will enjoy this collection. it is michael j fox at his best and its well worth having
positive,"Kids enjoy it.: Merlin keeps resurfacing over hte years and the kids enjoy playing it, as did I when I was younger."
positive,Very Action packed and cool: I like this movie. I like the part when Moby Dick attacks. I think the captain is weird.
negative,"Ugly Video, Missing Sound Effects and Skips: A Rip-off!: I hope this review gets posted in time to warn fans of the original release to AVOID this copy. My college-age sons and I have been Hobbit fans since their toddler days when watched our original VHS tape until they had it memorized (dialog, songs and sound effects) and our tape disintegrated.Seeing Peter Jackson's version made us remember the simple joys of watching the Rankin & Bass production together in our younger days.I purchased this VHS thinking that it was going to be like our tape of old, you know, with a watchable picture, clear sound, wonderful sound effects.This version is a mess. The picture was dark and murky. Several skips interrupted what could be seen. Worst of all, the wonderful sound effects that enriched the key scenes in the story are missing from this VHS tape.Pleas, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this miserable copy!"
positive,Etc is a fun game: Etc is a fun game and easy for the whole family to play. Questions aren't terribly difficult so the game moves quickly.
negative,"A waste of your time: Considered such a masterpiece - I HAD to read it. What a waste of time...First - the language: extremely difficult and archaic. Even for English speaking people. Can one enjoy a book if one needs a dictionary every couple of lines ?Then the allegedly 'cultural' riddles Joyce planted in the book for the sole purpose of torturing generations of English literature students and their teachers. Ask yourself - are you going to enjoy a book that neccesitates your literature teacher lie next to you and explain its 'sophistication' to you ? Every other page ?Then the foreign languages quotes in latin, german, irish, italian and who knows what else...Did Joyce expect his readers to be THAT fluent in other dialects ?Personally - I think Joyce wrote the book being completely drunk. Or worse.Last but not least - the story, the time frame and the main characters - boring, boring and then boring again.Your reading time could be used on much more pleasant, interesting books. Really."
positive,"ULTIMATE CHAKA: I was browsing through all the CK albums available and enjoyed the other two reviews of this album. This is just a quick and spontaneous shout out. I just want to say I own over 1,000 CD's from many genres and this is simply, I think, the best one I own...definitely a ""desert-island disc"" if there ever was one. You know, the music you would take if your were stranded forever on a desert island.I Love Everything About This Album. Songs, production AND CHAKA! The initial single was ""Got to be There"" and it is just a gem and a half. For a real throwdown, however, there is the opening track ""Tearin' It Up"" and it really does tear it up.If you can find this album JUMP ON IT...believe it or not I got mine in a little used CD shop for $4.99 and it's the Japanese Import version. It's the same as the US release but it's kinda fun to see the liner notes in 2 languages."
negative,powernutra: I saw no results from this product.I dont really like trying to take something an hour before a meal .Busy people dont have time to watch the clock before eating.
positive,"Satin A-Line Dress fit for curves: I bought this dress in white for my informal shotgun wedding ceremony at City Hall. I am typically a 16/18W and I bought a 2X in this dress.(I have more of an hourglass figure with wider hips and a smaller waist). The dress fits true to size and looks very flattering. Also, I am 5'9 and the dress hits just below my knee. I love the satin finish and matching shawl that comes with it. I do have to get the top tailored slightly because it's too big for my 38C size. Other than that it's perfect for my event!"
positive,"A music fan from Ca. U.S.A.: This album is truly a masterpiece. Immortal has goneback to their heavy-metal roots. The songs are long and not complex as their previousalbums were. Different direction, not as fast as their older albums, but stillunmistakable Immortal. I trulyrecommend this album."
positive,"Good: I had never heard Garbage before I listened to Version 2.0 at a listening kiosk at Tower Records, but I was immediately hooked. It's like a modernized Pretenders on steroids. I'd definitely recommend it. END"
negative,"Feels like duct tape: The baby dry diapers are terrible! I'm so glad I didn't buy them. I received them as a shower gift. They have a plastic duct tape feel to the top portion and they left my son's skin very moist. He literally had urine sitting on his skin when I opened his diaper. NOT my idea of a good diaper. I stick to Pampers Swaddlers or Pampers Cruisers, depending on which size you are using."
positive,A Very Pleasant Story: Diane Lane gives a great performance in this romantic/fantasy driven movie. I know many people dream of going to another place to escape the pressures of daily life and this movie does that for you. If you like romantic movies in a far away land then this movie is for you.
negative,"This story smells like Hollywood..: This movie is an insult to the real spies, the men and women who parachuted into Germany and risked their lives to scrape some information.The real spies were NOT charming little secretaries serving under charming handsome officers.They WERE everything from prostitutes to clever liars. They usually lasted from 0.5-2 months before they were caught. And when they were caught they were 1. Tortured 2. Interrogated 3. either sent to concentration camps/shot/or made to work for the germans.In all this movie is everything but real."
positive,"Far and away the BEST Christmas CD!: I adore this CD! I am giving it out as Christmas gifts. It's wonderful music, and peaceful too. Great for parties and get-togethers where you want soft music that won't annoy or be overbearing. This is a must have for any music collection."
positive,Roger Rabbit: When I was little I really loved this movie I used to have the roger rabbit doll where you pull the string in the back and the doll talked. I still have the movie on VHS and watch it occasionally every now and then I just don't have the doll anymore but excellent movie very good. 2 thumbs up. If you like Roger Rabbit then get this movie in dvd better quality of the picture I think but if your old school then go for VHS.
negative,"TOTAL DISAPOINTMENT: I don't know what I was expecting, but this CD blows. I wishI could take it back and get my money back. The songs I felt were just boring and we've already heard them a million times. Nothing new here."
negative,"This toy should be recalled!: My son likes this toy, but the back wheels keep falling off! Every time he runs into an object with it, one of the back wheels falls off, and the thing falls over on him, and he ends up under it. No matter what we do, we can't push them in so that they stay on, even when we hear them ""click"" into place. Also, when we try to put the sides together to let him ride on it, the latch that keeps it open is so tight that it takes two of us to switch it. It was a gift, so we can't take it back to the store, but I am going to contact Fisher Price about the wheel problem."
negative,"only 1 in the bag: >:I assumed that the 3 items in the picture was what I was buying, not 1, what am gonna do with one?"
positive,"I am disabled and a photographer, this makes my life easier: This camera is the best for me. I am disabled and have trouble with heavy items, see it's my hands and wrists that are disabled, so this camera REALLY helps! I have had three other Minoltas and love them. This one helps me because it is lite in weight, and offers both manual and automatic, which is great. Comes with a Zoom 28 - 80 lenz, which is so easy to use! Don't be scared to buy this one, it's a gem!"
negative,"Hard to get into: This book was very hard to get into. I didn't like the way the story jumped from one character to another. It was like the author's mind was all over the place when she wrote it. I really didn't understand the point in the story.It took me forever to finish this book,I just had a hard time picking it up again.I eventually did finish it, but was very disappointed in it."
positive,"The Tale of a Decade: This DVD is in my library of Great films because it was entertaining but at the same time had a moral I'd like my son to understand.It was comedic in its dealing with the theme of the decades of the 60's and the 70's ( and even today) yet at the same time dealt seriously and respectfully with the topic.There was one theme, of a group's search for recognition of humanity and inalienable rights in the story of a young woman who kills her husband for her freedom and a younger Black man who gives his life in a similar cause. The two ongoing stories were handled in a unique and entertaining manner.I will watch this DVD over again and enjoy it many times in the future. I will watch for other films directed by Antonio Banderas."
positive,The Hobbit: I liked this very much. A good version of the classic book. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to my friends.
positive,okay: The biggest problem with this movie in blu ray is that the monsters look more fake the clearer the movie is.
positive,"Wonderful!!!!!!: My 2-year old son absolutely, positively loves these tapes. When he wakes up in the morning he stretches and asks for the ""dancing lady."" He tries to say some of the African worlds. And boy does he try to dance along. He can't twist his hips like the little children in the tape but he shakes his head in time to the music. My care provider enjoys the stories and music also. I love them too. This video series is a must for any child, regardless of ethnicity. It is a must for any parent who realizes that his/her child will grow up the ""global village."" Thank you, Nandi"
positive,"Best of the Lot: I'm in the middle of reading The Diary of Mattie Spenser, which makes 3 Sandra Dallas books in a row. I enjoyed ""Buster"" the best --- hands down. Ms. Dallas' art of finding and expressing the voice of an ordinary woman is at her finest in this book. Like several other reviewers, The Persian Pickle Club (her most famous?) was the least rewarding for me. But, she really has the voice perfectly with Effa Commander in this novel."
negative,Good ONLY for total beginner: I came away with literally nothing new from this book. If you have read many web forums or other books- this is aimed at complete newbies.I also didn't like the writing style or editing. If you know the very basics and don't want to be 'spoken' to like a 5yr old get Andy Stanford's excellent Surgical Speed Shooting.I am just not the target audience for this material.
positive,Action Pack Series Going To Extreme!: The package came inmediately and in good conditions. Series have becomes more action pack that before. Showed lots of new superheroes and how they'll be attach to Superman. AWESOME!!
negative,"Not a good read: boring, self centered, Amazing what she thinks about her job and her bosses and ...just not a good read. also NARRY A RECIPE but then just a book to ride coat tails and make some fast $$$ As far as the swear words she defends so much, without them there would really be absolutely no spice. But even they become boring and trite after awhile."
negative,"Nonsense!: This movie could have been more than it was. The evolution of robots into laborers appears to be within the grasp of modern technology, and robots beginning to take control of the humans who made them is already here . . like in space travel or microsurgery where people are unable to take manual control of the process . . . This concept goes back to RUR, the Czech play of decades ago, but, in any case, this version dissolved into a juvenile shoot-em-up. Instead of a thoughtful presentation of robots and their potential dangerous side effects, an examination of the advantages and disadvantages of these mechanical workers, it becomes a trivialized and stereotypical piece of nonsense, with the nasty corporate leader, the pretty but skeptical female scientist, the crusty and unbelieving police captain, and the hero, who survives in spite of himself."
positive,"A light you can ""Will"" to your children...: I am a retired Trooper. I still have my orginal streamlight (still in use) from 1988. It smashed out windshields, and was used as a self defense tool and is still in perfect working order. I have replaced a few batteries and bulbs, that is to be expected.I bought the Stinger Ultra after retirement and use it everyday. Just as good as the old light from my cruiser, but a bit smaller and lighter. Just as tough and I expect to have to ""will"" these lights to my son when I die.People always say, I wish they made things like they used to. This company does just that.The best money I ever spent. I have given them as gifts and get eternal thanks for them from the recipients.Wives and children, If you have the husband or Dad that has everything and he doesn't have one of these (Streamlight Ultra Stinger 78002), he doesn't have it all yet.Oh, and get the vehicle and house charger, it is worth it."
negative,"Starts Out Good but Declines Throughout the Book: During the first chapter of the book. It hooks you right away. From the moment the characters arrive at the barn it declines. If you have ever seen ""Pinky and the Brain"" these are the characters. Except Lennie is more stupid than Pinky! My two year old cousin has more common sense than Lennie. The book is highly illogical."
positive,"Love this history text!: Interesting and readable. The author gives enough information for a great overview of world history, yet it's condensed enough to be a relatively quick and easy read. He has a balanced perspective and is good at hitting the most important themes."
negative,"Skip it: Three ladies who make sure to have a meeting of the minds every month. The general theme of the book smells of Sex in the City, but for me that was an okay thing to go into as I loved the show (and plan to read the book). So I had some good hopes going into the book. I also was excited because so far I have enjoyed the Shopaholic series, and this is the same Author, different name.Sadly the book did not live up to my hopes. While I love Sophie Kinsella but under the name Madeline Wickham she just falls flat. The book is not nearly as funny as the shopaholic series, and there just seems to be something else missing as well. The women in this book come off as just plain shallow to me. Where while our lovely Shopaholic has issues, she also shows she can be a good human. I just don't see that in Three Cocktails, so in my humble opinion this is a big pass."
positive,one of my favorites: This is a CD that I can put in the player at any time during the day regardless of the mood that I'm in. It's swing music so it will always put you in a good mood and the songs have enough variety that they don't sound the same.This is a very good CD especially if you're new to swing music.
positive,"Very Easy to Set Up!: Although this item took a little longer than I would have liked to arrive it was very easy to set up. It only took me about 10 minutes to go through the wireless setup on my tivo after plugging in this USB. I HIGHLY reccomend using this instead of telephone lines, you get many more features on your tivo if your wireless!"
positive,"An excellent book: An amazing story and very well-written. This book will take you through Van Gogh's life, inform you about this amazing but troubled artist, and leave you with your mouth open. Good for all ages and types of people. The only tough thing about the book is that it is sort of a slow journey... you might find yourself wandering a bit in the early chapters, but it is immensely satisfying if you can forge through them and take an amazing ride through this guy's life (don't skip any chapters)."
positive,"Great shoe- lots of compliments: These shoes are my favorite in my closet right now. I have them in chocolate. They are so pretty and look great on- I have big feet (size 10) and they make them look much smaller than usual. The one minus is that they are a bit weird to walk in. I just don't feel completely steady in them b/c they have a different and heavy wooden heel, but it just takes some getting used to. I'd highly recommend them."
positive,"My Review for Lord of the Flies: The author's message in this book was to open the eyes, and reveal how evil can appear in anyone. I agree with his message because it's true: evil can appear where ever it wants to. Just look at those school shootings, they unfortunately prove my point. I think he did the characters very descriptively. He is psychoanalyzing every main character in the entire book. It was very believable. I could imagine a news report saying about a couple of boys found on a burning island. About changing the book, I think it should stay the way it is. Some parts are very confusing, but it should stay the way it is. Some parts are important and confusing, but they need to stay because they are important and changing them could change the entire ""lot."""
positive,"It is a book about hobbits and other things.: I think it is a really interesting book about a hobbit that goes on an adventure to the Lonely Mountain with his dwarf friends. They get into lots of weird problems, like when they get strung up by some spiders. My favorite character is Gandalf the Wizard. He helps them sometimes. It was a very good book."
negative,"Draco would not approve of this.: I am not someone who hates sequals. I absolutly hate the first Dragonheart it is a masterpiece. Great effects, great story, sad ending. It is a five star movie all the way. This is horible. First of all the effects are awful. Many dragon films form the 1960s looked better. Drake looks like a cartoon. The plot is worse then the effects. It involves finding a dragon egg. Where did he come from. The first said draco was the last one. Now this movie said he wasn't. THIS RUINS THE FIRST MOVIE. The acting stinks. I can't believe anyone over the age of 5 would like this... Watch the first Dragonheart."
negative,"Fallaceous Method: A central methodological thinking error of Sarfati's book, typical of the creationist genre, is the mistaken belief that large, intricately complex structures necessarily imply a creator. Rather than speculate about distant subjects such as ancient species origin, let's look at something clearly knowable and only 2,000 years old. My Ph.D. is in linguistics and I have taught or directly supervised instruction in over two dozen languages. Each language is an extremely, elaborately complex, multi-systemic structure. Two thousand years ago, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, etc., didn't exist. They exist today, each as a highly complex structure, but none was created, nor was its direction of development directed by anyone. Each simply evolved from spoken Latin; the evolution of each is known and documented. It is manifestly unnecessary to postulate the existence of a creator to account for multi-layered, highly organized structures."
positive,"Right on the Money!: I heard a short segment on Stu Epperson's radio show as he discussed investments with Steven Selengut. I heard enough to prompt me to search for his book on the internet. As a securities rep. myself, Steve appears to be ""right on the money"". I didn't want to put the book down until I was through. Steve's trading strategy is refreshing information that should make a lot of people a lot of money with less risk. I have even contacted him with a couple of questions and was pleased with his prompt and courteous response. Thank you Steve for sharing your success with everyone. In your next book, please remember that all ""advisors"" are not ""sharks"", some of us do put our clients first."
negative,"This ""New Transfer"" ""Special Edition"" Is Neither!!: Buyer beware. This release of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the same identical Pioneer Special Edition that was released several years ago, just with a new packaging on it. There are no new extras, no new transfer. The only difference is the price tag: this release is about $10.00 cheaper. This is one of the most dishonest pieces of marketing I have ever seen.Make no mistake, the film is a fine and important movie, well worth owning and watching over and over.But if you already own it: beware of buying a duplicate copy."
positive,"Almost Worth Waiting For......: Having read all of the Leaphorn and Chee stories, I eagerly awaited this one. It is not as good a read as other Leaphorn and/or Chee books but I enjoyed it all the same. I strongly recommend that anyone planning to read this book as their first adventure into solving a mystery the Navaho way, start with one or more of the earlier books in this series. I do enjoy the way this author describes landscapes, people, Native American traditions, and Indian folklore to solve crimes. I have never been to Navaho country but somehow (thanks to the author) it seems very familiar."
negative,"Molly Myers: Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme."
positive,"Peter at his best: I could not think of a better live album. The sound is great, the musicians are very good and the songs.... you'd better look by yourself. Tony Levin makes bass and stick sound tough and clear. Manu Katche is clockwork and Jean Claude Naimro creates sound ceiling in the concert. But the best is Paula Cole I think. Peter's voice has no changes: the same as always. The compositions are the same as always. The difference is the musicians and their buen rollo. El mejor disco en muchos años. Lo que venga después será peor."
positive,"The best movie on Earth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: My name is Dimple Permaul and I think that this movie is extremely enjoyable.There is nothing wrong with this movie.It's Fantastic!I have not seen anything like it.It may be Rated PG 13,but I do not care.I love the books.My favorite so far is,The Half Blood Prince.I finished it in 2 days at exactly 3:48 in the morning.I'm writing a book myself.I'm turning it into a 7-book series.The first book is called The Underwater Adventure.i HOPE IT GETS PUBLISHED!"
positive,Great concert!: This concert features Ringo playing Beatles classics that he rarely performs live (if ever)... Don't Pass Me By and Octopuses Garden! Ive seen Ringo live several time and these great songs are left out. Considering how great they sound on this concert i hope he considers including them as concert staples. This show lacks the usual greatest hits night of the supporting band (although it has Who Can It Be Now by the Men At Work guy). Wish it included more songs from the band....their contribution is half the show! Instead you get Ringos new material which some songs are surprisingly catchy..others the usual B-side at best type songs. Sound quality and picture on this blu-ray are awesome! Loved it!
negative,"Read it only for school: I had to read this book for school, and I really didn't like it. There were good parts, but there was a lot of wasted words in other parts. I was very surprised that some of the bad events were in great detail and the ok parts were not. I hated the bad parts because they were so disgusting to read. I am only 12 and I think this book is better for mature readers. This book had a great theme, but a lot of the not so important events could have been taken out. If you are a mature reader and like science fiction, you will probably like this book."
negative,"451 review by Jessica C.: when i read Farenheit 451, my first impression was that this book is so screwed up. i mean like who would want to not read a book. thats just so wrong. the one thing i did like about the book was Guy's wife, Mildred. i liked her alot because she said that the t.v was her family. she was a little crazy though. i also liked the part where she called the firemen and told them that Guy had books. then she walked out on him. i also liked the mechanical dog. that was something very original. i gave the book 2 stars because i really thought that it was a waste of time to read it. but you know, that is only my impression of the book.Writen By:Jessica C."
negative,"Uncomfortable: This life vest is fine except for one very serious flaw - even if you are a pencil neck geek the cut out for your neck is still going to squeeze you uncomfortably. When they fix this it will be a winner, but in the meantime look at the Stearns instead."
positive,"The cooked rice smells good to heaven: It's really my pleasure to cook with this rice cooker. I always set the cook time as 6:30AM, the tasty smell just sweetened my dream, I love it.I rank it as the best rice cooker ever in the world, I marketed this product to all my friends, it worth of the money if they knew how beautiful the rice is cooked.I am very critical on food, but this rice cooker just broke me down, I don't have any negative words on it. O...hold on....there IS ONE - the price.I can use it forever, and will buy a bigger one when I got married.Jessica Liu"
positive,A compact and well written book.: The proofs are well structured and easy to follow. The techniques used in the proofs lend themselves for use in other situations. A lot of information is embeded in the exercises which keep the students alert and focused and at the same time saves time and space. A good book for undergraduates in mathematical analysis.
positive,"Excellent Wooden Blocks, Exactly as Described: These blocks are a perfect size for my 1 year old's hands. These blocks have grooves, similar to a tongue and groove, on two opposing sides. The grooves allow for different stacking options and more stable stacking. Quality product."
positive,"if you're angry, get it now !: This album is the very definition of metalcore.Very heavy songs, filled with anger and pain.I give it 4 stars because I think some lyrics could 've been improved, and some songs sound the same, But It's suerely a good album. Worlds apart is my favourite song."
positive,"Love is stronger than showbizz: Young, she arrives in Hollywood to become a star and she becomes a star by falling in love with another star who falls in love too. But this love affair is tragic because the man is at the end of his charm and can only regress, whereas she represents the new style, the new era that is opening at this moment and she goes up so fast she crushes her husband into oblivion and non-existence. But she remains faithful to her love, and he does not want to block her in her career. So he commits suicide to free her road and she nearly cracks up and goes away. But she can stick to her career by assuming his name as hers. A very sad film about the film industry and its law of the jungle.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
positive,"A Rediscovered Childhood Favorite: I was thrilled to find this in a used bookstore a few years ago and promptly bought it for my own kids. All three have loved it. They identify with universal themes of lonliness, thrill of doing something forbidden, fear of getting in trouble and happiness at being forgiven.Plus, it's so free of the baggage of today's silliness, which makes me happy. People who object to the dolls frilly underwear showing are probably the same folks who object to the boy's exuberant nakedness in Sendak's book (The Night Kitchen"" I think)."
negative,"They will send you the wrong size cap!: I specified the year, make, and model of my vehicle to purchase a locking gas cap and this is what was suggested that would fit my 3/4 ton gas Silverado. It arrived and it didn't fit. I ended up giving it to a friend because the cost to ship it back would have almost equaled the price of this gas cap. It seemed very cheaply made so it was probably for the best as I ended up going to O'Reilly Auto Parts where they sold me the correct gas cap. It was less than $20 out the door, but it is a much better than what this gas cap is.Skip this and go to an auto parts store."
positive,"Great Book for any Age: I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. All I have to say is that I found this book extremely interesting and thrilling. When my teacher recommended this book to me, I was skeptical, however, Foundation turned out to be one of the best books I ever read and I can't wait to read the other ones. Psychohistory and Hari Seldon rock! Whoever doesn't read this book is missing out on one of the best ever."
negative,"here we go again!: holy crap once again this faggot NElly comes out with a horrible album, omg dont get this, paul wall song is whack, the only good song to listen to is Nasty Girl. Nelly is still whack and always will be, listen to true rappers like NWA, Nas, Eminem, Dre, not these bubble gum rappers like Mike Jones, slim thug etc.Seems to me like hip hop is getting worse and worse every year, where the days where people would talk about important things rather then cars and girls.This nelly guy collaborated with NSync WTF!! and Tim Mcgraw also WTF! XTINA, Fat Joe, Lil Flip all horrible people and yet he does it. I dont think he cares about what his fans think, wish he wouldve stuck with something like Country Grammer only thing but this CD is just horrible dont get it!(...)"
positive,"Very entertaining: A very good read. This book really takes you into the hearts and minds of Mexico and its people. It is not your typical travel book. Time is not spent on hotel and restaurant ratings but on surviving your trip. I have read it twice now as I prepare for a visit to Mexico and for retirement there in 4 years.The stories are entertaining and fun to read. In many cases you can imagine yourself in those very same situations. You will laugh out loud on many occassions. This is definately a great book and comes highly recommended.Now, if they would only write one on retiring in Mexico....."
positive,"Big conviction in a small package: This is a hard hitting little book. I can not pick it up without saying, ""Ouch."" It is filled with ""If - Then"" statements, all ending in ""Then I know nothing of Calvary love."" It is a small book, and ""if"" is a small word, but it has a big impact. It is filled with wise and profound statements covering many areas of life. Every time I pick it up it shows me how little I know of Calvary love, and how much God has yet to change me. This is not a book to read once and then put down. It is one to open up at random on a daily basis. It isn't a book shelf book, but one to be kept by the bedside, coffeepot, kitchen table, or any where else that will remind you to pick it up again. It is a convicting reminder of how God loves each of us, and how He expects each of us to pass His love along."
negative,"Why did I see this piece of trash?*: ""I Spit on Your Grave"" may well be the kind of film that might be given a four star rating by people with sick minds.Last I checked,I'm the complete opposite.Sure,I love horror films.Horror films with good taste.After viewing this movie,there are no doubts in my mind that I should have had my head checked.I should have been locked up in a loony ward for buying this ... A young woman is raped a few times by a group of men who later get their just desserts.Everything in this film is really bad.The acting.The castration scene is one example of bad acting.My question is why did this girl just leave when they were harrasing her?This is not a horror movie.This is not a movie at all.I know a great horror film when I see one.I Spit on Your Grave may have been the kind of film I would have rush to rented on video fifteen years ago.Guess I smartened up."
negative,"CURVED, NOT STRAIGHT: I bought these Trim Toenail Clippers because of ""NJMOM's Review"" above. NJMOM stated these clippers are ""STRAIGHT"" not ""CURVED"", WRONG, these clippers are CURVED! I emailed Farm & Home Supply Center for a ""RGA Number"" to return these clippers and never got one. I'll keep them but I'm not happy.If you want a straight cutting blade toenail clipper, these are not the ones. Get the Tweeezerman ones."
negative,HORRIBLE! Too easy and vague: DO NOT USE THIS TOOL IF YOU ARE STUDYING FOR THE COMPS! I used this book and felt INCREDIBLY unprepared for the comprehensive exam (the CPCE). Get ANYTHING different!
positive,"Nice little appliance.: Pros:It keeps my mom's coffee warm while she reads her news paper, and it made a awesome gift. It makes candles smell really good too.Cons:Dont spill your coffee on it or its ruined._."
negative,"Poor durability and hard to fill: Never satisfied with traditional mills, I bought these because they had a unique design. I liked that they stick to the fridge but have found that means I occasionally have to wipe off pepper flakes. The small, rectangular holes make funneling refills difficult and messy. About a month into light use, the pepper mill gummed up and cleaning was a real chore. After about a year of moderate use, the pepper mill just wasn't grinding properly anymore. Cute but not very durable."
positive,"How to Get Laid Today! The System by Roy Valentine: Every page of this book outlines the secrets that separates the men from the boys. After reading this book and about a month of practice I have opened my on modeling agency and I have had sex with everyone of my models. Before I was blessed with the knowledge from the sex God, Roy Valentine, i had no self-confidence. Now, no women is untouchable. I owe every happy moment of my last two months to this book and I would recommend it to anyone who is ready to really start living life."
negative,"This movie doesn't even deserve a star...: OK, I knew it would be bad. But, I love yoga and have heard a lot about Madonna's ability as a yogini. I sat through this entire agonizing movie to see one 45 second second scene of her doing yoga. {SIGH} Don't bother."
negative,"Thought I'd love it...I thought wrong.: Boy was I disapointed. This film had no character developement, no real ""set up"", and the stunts were ridiculous. This seemed more of a 007 ""wanna be"", and 007 Vin Diesel is not. I watched the enitire film waiting for it to get better, it didn't. I would rent this before buying it, if I were you."
positive,"Still the Favorite Incognito album of mine!: With no bad tracks from Step into my Life to Keep the Fires Burning, this is Bluey and the Cogs signature project, hands down. Deep Waters alone is worth the whole purchase, but this is one of the best jazz funk albums ever pressed on disc. A MUST-HAVE!"
negative,"Ineffective for promoting vivid dreams: I bought this product because I heard from my Native American friends that it promotes vivid dreams. I have used it under my pillow for three weeks and no luck so far, though most of my hair has fallen out and my teeth are loose."
negative,"NOT a graphic novel: This listing came up for me when looking for a graphic adaptation of the Hobbit for my school age boys. Unfortunately what I received was a trade paperback. when I contacted the seller, I was told that was what I ordered. they are issuing a return, but this listing is WRONG. I am sorry I didn't take the advice of an earlier reviewer."
positive,"The Descent: This movie was really great, I wasn't expecting much, but this movie has more blood than any horror movie I've seen so far. Good story, very scary at times, and I don't scare easily, enjoyed this movie very much."
negative,"DO NOT BUY, A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!: My daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her. She was so excited. We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen. The game was so so boring. You get to choose music, outfits, and which of the three skaters to skate. That is IT. Everything else is controlled automatically by the game. Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not. My daughter hasn't played it since and is so disapointed in it. The store I bought it from won't let me return it because it has been opened. They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem. This game was a waste of time and money."
negative,"Shallow little girl: Carlton thinks she is so damn profound, oooooo you came up with one of the most self important pseudo intellectual album names ever in ""Be Not Nobody"" Be Not Nobody? Try ""Be not educated."" This girl is a shallow child, and it shows in her daft music. Just because you drop a name like Steinbeck in a song doesn't make you smart, or worldly. Here's a cookie, now shut up and go play with your even more narcissistic pseudo-intellectual boyfriend Johnny Third Eye Blind. These two are cut from the same lame ass hipster mold that you can find in any of the coffee shop of Berkeley, pontificating on their own genius and never realizing that they are not special no matter what people tell them. You want real ""intelligent"" music; try John Lennon or Tori Amos. Listening to Carlton's lyrical drivel is like grading a freshmen Philosophy paper, it's trite and irrelevant."
negative,"Boring and not fun at all: I found this book at Goodwill and thought the movie was interesting so I thought the book would be as well. It wasn't. It was boring, had nothing to do with cooking, and I don't get a good impression of the author. The swear words were offensive, and I only got through the first couple chapters when I realized I had no interest in reading the rest of it. This book will be going back to Goodwill."
positive,"INTRIGUING!: We are introduced to the infamous Reverend Curtis Black, his family, their church family and all of the drama that comes along with it. I enjoyed this book, because it proves that Christians should keep their eyes on God,not on man, because man is human, too."
negative,"For what it's worth....: If you're out to collect all of Brandon Lee's work, this is an essential. If not, you may want to pass. While the martial arts work is slick, and the dialog is peppered with some good humor, the plot is rather lacking. To top it off, Stephen Glantz (writer) has apparently never actually spoken to a woman, because he certainly can't write for them. Tia Carrere is utterly wasted (yes, even for her skills, this is a waste) in the most unrealistic female character in film. Even her nude scenes are a body double.If your looking for martial arts action you haven't already seen, you could get this one. Just don't get your hopes up."
negative,"How to sell garbage to hippies: Castaneda's books are garbage designed to make money from gullible hippies, and there are plenty of them still around. Caveat emptor, to say the very least."
negative,Slow going: Hardly anything past exotic stepcercise playing at your local gym save the oft-cited and featured-elsewhere PNG.
negative,"Industrial Pressure, Level and Density Measurement: This book covers the basics of the subject material however it is repleat with errors. Equations are sometimes incorrect (page 9). The author mixes tense in the same sentence. From an academic standpoint it is probably O.K.. It is obvious that the author has little practical (or field) experience. Considering the price I cannot reccomend this book as there are many other titles that contain a better treatment of the subject matter."
positive,Itsy Bitsy Spider: I love having board books that are different to use and share with the parents I work with as an infant teacher. This book fits the bill as it is a common song. Great idea!
negative,"Nothing like the book.: This adaptation of George Orwell's brilliant satire has lost all the meaning. If you've read the book, don't see the movie. If you haven't read the book, still don't see the movie."
positive,"Wow! Can you do that?: I liked this movie. But, only after a lot of thinking. This is a mucked up movie whichleaves you with a strange feeling in your stomach. But it is still very good for being so different. A break from the norm. The DVD is especially good with all the extras."
positive,The 6 Inch LCD Digital Caliper: This is a handy item. It came in a protective case and works well. The extra batterys are a nice touch.
positive,Good stuff: This is the real deal AC Delco brand that GM uses. It went on my Trailblazer and is working just fine. Coming back for another one when the time is due
positive,"Once into it, a wonderful and uplifting read.: Betsy Howie's Snow took me a few pages to get into -- she starts without providing the context upon which we readers tend to depend. I also feared that the book would be an angst-filled and self-absorbed ramble...it starts out feeling that way. After 20 pages, I was hooked. With creativity, humor, and heart, Howie takes us through a woman's self-discovery and her meeting of herself. There were moments when I felt I had lost the storyline, but that was due to my concrete thinking rather than any fault of the author. She asks the reader to stretch reality, break out of the dictates of linear time and one-dimensional experience, and imagine an inner world as real and tangible as the one we usually think of as ""reality."" I loved the cat, Vinny, who gently encourages the narrator on her journey of self-discovery. I loved that Vinny, himself, ended up learning about self-acceptance, truth, and happiness. I recommend this book highly!"
negative,"Dissappointing. Started great but the paper feed is a problem.: I bought this printer from Staples back in January. It was terrific and I really was hoping to take advantage of the scanner, the printer, and the network port. Seemed like a great package. But the paper feed issue is real.I'm using standard printer paper from Staples, nothing fancy. But the printer simply isn't picking the paper up. If I don't do anything the ""Out of Paper"" message appears. I literally have to push the paper in when i'm printing (of course that sometimes causes the printer to jam known as a lose-lose)Also, the software the comes with the printer is dreadful. Scanning is good, but forget about it if you want to copy pictures off a memory card you stuck in the printer.It's too bad, i've never had such a bad HP printer experience either with an inkjet or laser at work. I'm dissappointed."
positive,Takes A Good Attention Span: I love the Warriors series. I have every book in my personal library. but the books take patience. Its mostly the same thing over and over agin. They eat hunt and sleep. everyonce and a while they will throw something incredible that you wouldnt expect though. It makes up for all the boring chapters they normaly have. by they i mean the the Erin Hunters. Four peple write these books.
positive,This is it: If you read only one peice of American literature this should be it. Whitman is a true Amercian. He feels the way we feel and he has seen the things we see. No matter who you are you will you think that he has read your mind...only in no so modern english.
negative,"Too basic: This DVD talks about the names of the pool table and rules for 8-ball and 9-ball. Its is very basic, with nothing about how to make a hand grip, stroke, english, bank shoots, and not even some pointers on aiming. Seems like this could be presented in 15 min followed by 45 min of SOMETHING, but there is no meat in there."
positive,"A Classic.: Many thanks to Collector's Choice for reissuing this magnificent album on CD, previously only available on disc in the fine but expensive and rare Japanese pressing.""Smoke From A Distant Fire"" is one of a few dozen tunes that instantly, for those of us in our late 30s/early 40s, takes you back to the great days of AM gold. And, the good part, it's not the only catchy, likeable tune on the record.In a time when almost anything seems to qualify as ""a classic"", this duo and these tunes really are."
positive,"Take the time to actually read a great book, read A Christmas Carol!: A Christmas Carol is one of the great works of English literature, and it is well known throughout the world. However, have you actually read it, or only seen it on television? I decided I wanted to read the original and find out what really was part of the story.This is an excellent story, with a great lesson. There's a reason why it's still so popular some 170 years after its original publication. Do yourself a favor, and take the time to actually read a great book, read A Christmas Carol!"
positive,"Gods & Kings: I loved this book. It accomplished the most important 3 things I look for when I read any book. 1. I didn't want to put it down and stop reading. 2. It made me ""feel"" a range of emotions, (I felt Hezekiah's fear, Abijah's pain and Zechariah's shame). 3. I felt like I learned or gained something new or valuable from reading it. Plus it made me want to actually pick up my bible, which I did afterwards to see how close or far from the source was the fiction. Can't wait to read the next book in the series."
negative,"Don't bother.: Have had mine for 1 1/2 years, 2-3 cups per week. Stopped brewing. I only used filtered water. Now, Keurig will give me a discount on a new one. What a rip off!!"
negative,"It really could have been more realistic.: This is sweet family fare, but that is what it is -- sweet. Where is the dirt of the 18th century? Where are the stinks and the vile smell -- even from the Roman curia?Unfortunately this all reeks of one of Kate Mulgrew's ""Irish Spring"" commercials.Saints aren't usually this nice. They are rebels who seek not only to serve God, but to upturn the status-quo. Mother Seton seems to work with the status-quo quite well. Where is the persecution? Where is the burning anger a saint often feels?Isn't there more?Just too sweet for my taste."
negative,"I Couldn't Finish It: It wasn't well-written, it wasn't well-organized, the narrator's personality didn't appeal to me. I just couldn't read more about her ungrateful whining about how bad her job is (without her government job there would be no sticks of butter to cook with--that's how life is) and her too-intimate details about how her crazy her friends are. Just sounded like a blog I'd probably never read, and a whole lot less recipes than I expected.But the movie was super-good. Amy Adams, and otherwise beautiful actress, reduced herself to a homely tomboy yet still made the character likeable (unlike in the book) and Meryl Streep, of course, made an excellent Julia. This is a credit to their acting skills.Don't read the book, not even if you get it for free. Just watch the movie."
negative,Good film but Amazon DVD not the SE as advertised or marked: The DVD I bought directly from Amazon was advertised as the Special Edition and was marked as such on the case and on the disc. However it actually seems to be the full-screen regular-length edition with no text commentary or SE extras. Do not buy.
negative,"The most violent generation: Here is a book that was hailed as a best seller before it was even released. One that was fed to the public by one of America's leading talking heads, Tom Brokaw. My grandfather was at Normandy and later helped liberate several concentration camps throughout Germany. What these experiences cost him, was ultimately his life. He rarely smiled after witnessing the horrific brutality, and inhumanity that was set loose on the world in WWII and after. This book is an attempt to rewrite, an already severely inaccurate history of this period of time. Brokaw tries to take the attention from the mass slaughter that was perpetrated by BOTH sides, and instead focus on the heartwarming yet tragic human interest stories so common to todays evening news. Living through the ""greatest generation"", killed my grandfather's spirit, along with millions of others like him, who instead saw in it a living hell, and a disgrace to humanity."
negative,not happy: I do not believe that the site showed this movie to only play in the UK. I believe the information was added after the fact.
positive,"Just terrific: This is an exceptionally well made film, very credible, with a great story to tell and lots of entertainment value.I highly recommend it."
negative,Have not received it as yet: It has been a month since this order was placed I have not received it as yet
negative,"Pardon me while I indulge in a moment of shallowness...: This book really, really sucks.It doesn't even DESERVE a more in-depth review. UGH."
positive,OUTSTANDING: This is a great CD if you love piano music. Emile Pandolfi has such a wonderful style and it is so relaxing to have his music as a background. A friend got me acquainted with Emile's CD's and I have been hooked every since!
negative,"Lord of the Flies is about the animalistic side of everyone: This is not a book that is for somebody who plans on being a dedicated reader. It is not a book that is easily accessable. It was hard to understand the symbolism and hidden features. It was hard to grasp some of the themes. However the message in the book is and important one to learn. It shows us that no matter how young, or old you may be you still have that seed of evil hidden inside of you."
negative,...: I purchased this book and attempted to use it as a resource for a trip to Cambodia in July 1999. The only current information in the entire country section was that Pol Pot has died. Cambodia is a fascinating place to visit...Too much has changed for this book to be of any use
positive,Love them: I always was a fan of Angie and Debbie Winans way back. I agree with the other review before Mary Mary it was Angie and Debbie Winans. I heard every song they sang on the radio and I will forever love their music and their style of fashion in their music videos. Angie and Debbie Winans you rock!!!!!
positive,"Great series: This purchase was made to replace the VHS version I made from cable twenty years ago.It offers all I was looking for, i.e. a great series on a friendlier format."
negative,"Not a practitioner's guide: For me, the book was verbose, repetitive, poorly organized. Not inspiring and not recommended."
negative,Don't buy it!: We were intially looking for something like the peaceful planet fish tank we had with our oldest. Couldn't find it so we got this thinking it would be as soothing. The motor is too loud to hear the music if you choose to have the lights and movement on. The lights don't give out enough light to show the fish moving and the fish don't move the way you would think.
negative,Not at all what I expected!: This book seems just a vehicle to vent the author's bitterness and is a very poor representation of the experience of Catholic schooling and upbringing. I am saddened to think readers may think it is. It is neither humorous nor entertaining. I read it cover to cover looking for merit and found none. I have to give it a poor rating.
positive,Good Value: It was much cheaper than what I was buying from my chiropractor. It seems to be working fine. I will purchase again.
negative,"Horrible...: I used this camera for a year untill during a period of a couple weeks of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one."
negative,"Discontinued by SONY: eMarker has been discontinued by Sony, here's the noticeThis is to inform you that we will be permanently closing down the eMarker.com service on 9/30/01. You will not be able to access your eMarker.com account after 9/30/01. If you have eMarks that you would like to save, simply print the screens from your eMarks pages. You will only be able to save hard copies of your eMarks information."
negative,"A horrible textbook!: This text is a nightmare. Terms are poorly defined, if defined at all, and examples are few and far between. The illustrations are laughable. I've seen better graphics in nursery books written 30 years ago. If your professor assigns this text, and you're new to Java, be prepared to shell out more bucks for better sources or cruise the Internet to get the answers you need. This book won't provide them."
positive,"A betles album, it must be good: The beatles are the best thing in music. By any cd and you will know that to"
negative,Go home Smith: This is a terrible missues of one of Asimovs greatest novels. The relevance to the novel is only marginal.Will Smith is (as usual) doing a terrible job at being an action hero. He should have stayed with the sit-coms.
positive,"Enchanting trip through Christianity: This is really one of the best Christians books of all time. The intention of Jack was to write about Christianity taking out the typical religious sting. This is not a small fit given the exclusive nature of religion. And Jack achieves his task marvelously.When Jack writes is like an old loved friend explaining to us things that until this moment where elusive to our understanding. He led us in a journey describing the enchanting building of Christianity and leave us marveled at the splendor of our discovery. This is a MUST have for any library (buy it hard copy, when you read it you will know why)."
negative,"Terrible: This album was a huge disappointment for me. Buy diary. The songs on 'this is how it feels...' make me think that sunny day has lost it for good. i cant't remember hearing such a bad album from such a good band. try listening to ""Mogwai"" if you like sunny day."
negative,"Barely any smell: I bought this candle after I was told that these were the best smelling and stronger than yankee candles. I have to say, I can barely smell this candle at all. I am VERY disappointed in this purchase. I got the Pumpkin Pie scented one."
negative,"Great printer, but HP refuses to support Vista (or XP 64-bit): I love this printer. But it transformed from a great little printer into a useless piece of plastic when I upgraded to Vista (on one machine) and XP 64-bit (on my other machine).HP's customer support was useless. The worst thing is that they actually have the drivers available on the website, but you have to purchase them for $20 and wait for a CD to arrive. They might be available for download sometime in 2008, but I'm not holding my breath.C'mon HP, you're dropping the ball. I just recommended that our office manager buy a fancy, big, expensive Lexmark for our new network printer because I was annoyed with your customer support. So this little decision to ask me for $20 for the drivers just cost you about $1000 in a lost sale."
positive,Good stuff: This stuff is a little smelly but it works. I use it pretty often on my shoulders and back. I would recommend it with no doubt.
positive,"awesome kit...: I was very much satisfied with this product.Pros:1. Good quality chips2. impressive Dyes3. awesome metal casecons:The base which carries the chips and cards is a bit damaged at couple of places.Over all, its a good bye."
positive,"System Does It Again...: System Of A Down, the greatest band EVER, have yet another great album. Their songs cover issues such as the prison system, the brutality of riot police and many others. It's interesting to just sit back with them blasting on your Discman, while you read the lyrics. You'll probably start making up your own song meanings (I know a lot of people that have done that), and you might actually look at current issues in a different way."
positive,Very good read: The majority of people may th think it a simple book I find it most interesting and entertaining for all ages .
negative,"Pissed Off!!!!!: When I ordered this item, I first checked the customer reviews and they were positive...so I ordered it. What I ordered and what actually came via mail were different! I ordered an OLIVE GREEN poncho and I received a BROWN poncho!!! When I attempted to contact to company (SPAGHETTI WESSTERN COLLECTIBLES), there was no number, no address, no e-mail!!! This company (SPAGHETTI WESTERN COLLECTIBLES) is NOT reliable!!! I wished to exchange this product but I got nothing but unavailability!!!DON'T BUY FROM SPAGETTI WESTERN COLLECTIBLES!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"Best book on the subject: (...) this is by far the best book on Jakarta-Tomcat. I learned more in the few hours spent reading this book, then I did in the days(weeks?) spent reading existing documentation and newsgroups. The book covers all of the newest features, and provides practical examples. All in all, a very useful resource."
positive,"Very Educational and Informative: My husband and I purchased this DVD after attempting to attend an in-person childbirthing class....they just weren't for us. We loved being able to watch this DVD at our leisure in the privacy of our own home. This was one of two DVD's that we purchased and this one was by far the best. Sheri's sense of humor was perfect for the subject matter in my opinion. It really put my mind at ease (a lot of the other courses really scared me) and I feel extremely prepared for labor and delivery. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants the benefit of being knowledgeable of labor and delivery, yet is hesitant to join an in-person class. I'll certainly keep this one and watch it for subsequent pregnancies."
negative,"Thank God I only rented it!: Well for me this movie had only one saving factor to it. And that is the special effects and the cool Mummy. I think the best way for me to describe the acting is it reminded me of a sitcom in it's first few shows. The actors didn't seem to be comfortable with there characters and it just seemed flat. The one liners where pretty cheesy.All I can say is rent it, if you like it buy it. But don't buy it without seeing it first."
negative,"A work of fiction: It is extremely important to realize that essentially all evidence of Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) comes from memories created during Recovered Memory Therapy (RMT). RMT has been shown to generate mostly false images: images that feel like real memories, but which are of events that never happened. It is also important to realize that Multiple Personality Disorder has now been rejected by almost all therapists. This book feeds into the victim culture of the 1980s and 1990s. It is thus dangerous to victims of recovered memory therapy and will probably delay their recovery. There are many books available that contain a realistic assessment of ritual abuse: K. Letcham & E. Loftus, ""The Myth of Repressed Memory.""R. Ofshe & E. Watters, ""Making Monsters.""M. Pendergrast, ""Victims of Memory."""
positive,"Sensible economic prognostications for a change!: Lingle has again written a book far more valuable than its price.For those interested in Asia,and the econo-politics of the region, this is a must for any library, private or public. It is easily readable even for those not initiated in the arcane language of economics. His initial beliefs were manifested in the last year and a half."
negative,"Poodle still can't talk: I bought this a few days ago as I read a canine training book that said Uranium Ore heightened canine intelligence. Since my family doesn't have a Geiger counter, we figured we'd just be safe if we kept the uranium in an airtight tupperware container with some used pencil lead. I placed the uranium ore under my standard poodle's makeshift bed and left it there for about six months. Lo and behold, our poodle figured out barking at nothing was illogical! Hence, since I saw the success and always wanted to have long, in-depth discussions with my poodle on American policy, I left the ore there for another six months. She now has six arms and still doesn't talk.I would give this .00000000001 star, but that's not possible. What a useless item."
negative,"Man Kzin IX: After a long hiatus from the Man-Kzin wars, I purchased the Man-Kzin Wars IX. The stories in M-K Wars IX were average at best. Of the 4 stories, the murder mystery was my favorite. The story about the crippled Kzin's last stand started well but deteriorated into a long-winded mutual admiration fest between the antagonists during the battle for Wunderland's liberation. It made as much sense as the Russians negotiating with and praising the positive qualities of the bunkered Germans during the battle for Berlin. The last story needed a good editor to clean it up, especially the beginning, and make it more coherent. IMO, this book is not worth buying and inferior to its predecessors."
negative,Worst phone ever: Bought this phone right when 2.4 GHz phones came out. I thought it would be an upgrade over 900 MHz phones. Boy was I wrong. The static on this thing is ridiculous. You will be talking with someone and all of a sudden its 95% static. Completely annoying...recommendation: AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
negative,"Buzzing renders it useless: It's light, it's convenient, it's easy to use. But what does it matter? In the end, the unit produces so much buzzing that it renders itself useless. It's just too annoying, and I would not ever want to watch the footage. I've been working with this for a year, sending it back and forth to Canon, and they tell me there is some ""allowable buzzing."" They actually replaced mine, hoping it would appease me, but the second unit was exactly the same.I've now missed filming the first 19 months of my daughter's life because of this. Canon doesn't seem to care much. Time to sell it on ...."
positive,They need more stars...: We can only hope more classics as precious and timeless as this are in our future. A must see every Christmas.
negative,"What is the big deal: What is the big deal? I read this book because a college age acquaintance had mentioned it was on a required reading list for one of his classes. In researching the book I found it is high on the list of existential writings. I got nothing out of it other than perhaps how empty existentialism is. No wonder students drop out of college and feel they are wasting their money. America is producing some fabulous literature yet there is an old guard that clings to all that is bleak in life. May I recommend Victor Frankle’s Man’s Search for Meaning? This is a much better and true account of the human spirit and what it can accomplish. If you have to read this to in class to placate the instructor do so but do not hesitate to counter with truth, hope and optimism and do not accept this as real life."
positive,"I'm reading it again and again!: I am reading this book again and again. My gosh--to finally have someone sit down and explain it is like--thank you!!!! I never had a mother or a sister to teach me this stuff and now I understand things that confused me.I understand the nonverbal behaviors of men--why they pull back--why I give myself up, what I do that sends the message I am insecure, etc. I believe this relationship book has changed the way I approach relationships permanently.I also understand what attracts a man so much more--I think we think it's all looks or sex. It really is dignity. Most importantly, it felt empowering. I felt good about myself after reading it, and I felt that I have much, much more to bring to my next relationship!"
positive,"Fantastic: I saw K.D. Lang in person in May of 2005. She was great, & has the most beautiful voice. Very energetic. She had the crowd in her hands. Also got her autograph & some pictures. The DVD is awesome.When she sings Crying, you shiver."
negative,"Inferior to other train tables: This train table is poorly designed in many ways. First of all, the storage area under the table for the buckets is set up so that you have to pull out at least one of them to access the others. Second, the track pieces aren't completely flush and cause the trains to catch. That would be ok if the magnets were stronger, but even on straight sections the cars often separate, and definitely around curves and up hills. Overall, I wish I had shopped around a lot more."
positive,Clay Is The Best!!!: There are very few CDs I've purchased that I have loved every song on and listened to over and over again and not tire of hearing. This is definitely one. How could you tire of this man's voice? It is absolutely amazing. Can hardly wait for the next CD to come out and the tours to start!
positive,"My experience: It was delivered in record time, well under the stipulated period for overseas delivery and in excellent condition. The dvd's were too tightly fitted which made removing them a task, but nothing a bit of patience couldn't fix. Good buy, great service."
negative,"I had to read it for school , what could I say: It draged a bit and was a bit boring . I liked the history in it about the early colonies . But still not my type of genre"
positive,"Solid Addition to the Series: Like the ones before, this book is a solid forensic and police procedural. A death row inmate is executed and his fingerprint later shows up in a current crime scene. How could that have happened? I particularly enjoyed seeing Kay's niece, Lucy, again, as she is 17 now and her own person, no longer a child. Lucy's computer skills continue to amaze. I look forward to reading the next in the series!(Note: There is a continuing bad guy introduced in this book who appears in the next two installments as well. I'd recommend reading this book before The Body Farm and From Potter's Field)"
positive,"Fantastic Advanced Course!: Many parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user. It is an informative, advanced reference; the only one needed for an experienced website creator. There are no color examples of what the HTML language produces, making some of it difficult to piece together if you are not experienced."
positive,Good replacement part: This was a good replacement brake pedal pad for my 98' Toyota Tacoma.A little tough to get on but it does need to fit tight and does after you get it on.Thanks AMAZON for having parts like this.
negative,"Watch out!: I bought some pills for myself and some of my friends to try out. They felt fine but I couldn't even take two (out of three) doses of the pill in one day. This stuff made me feel really nauseas, queezy, and a bit disoriented and restless - which I attribute to the caffeine in this product because I can barely drink one cup of coffee without feeling kind of weird.I never thought diet pills were the solution, and this product just confirms that. I strongly recommend working on the internal issues as to why you can't loose the weight instead of searching for shortcuts."
positive,BRAND NEW USED BOOK: I still can't believe that this is a used book. I was practically untouched. What an unbelievable product for an amazing price. Thanks again.Eddie O
positive,"Simply GREAT: This is exactly what I needed. I bought 2 and couldn't be happier. Keeps my shoes up off the ground, visible and neat. Love the use of space vertically. This is a well-made, sturdy, space saving shoe-a-holic's friend!"
negative,"Wrong, very wrong!: I started to read just the introduction and I started to sense that something was wrong, very wrong. Besides the assumption of eco-feminism as compatible with Orthodoxy, he discusses the occult he was deeply involved with in terms that made me more than uncomfortable: admiration, an ambassador's tone in describing occult matters, almost reminiscent of patriotism. This is the sort of thing one should speak of out of deep humility spurred by repentance from serious sin.This is the first time I have purchased a book that I thought was Orthodox theology and didn't get past the introduction before regretting I'd made the purchase.If you wonder, ""Does this critic have anything better to say?"" then <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/author/cjshayward"">I invite you to visit my own author's section.</a>"
negative,Crossing Over: If you liked Karen Clark's other CDs and the style of those CDs you should not purchase this CD. 2nd Chance is not for those of us who enjoyed her more traditional style.
positive,"One of my all time favorite movies.: This is an absolutely hilarous movie, from beginning to end. Aside from being a dead-on parody of the Robin Hood movies, it's packed with classic comedy and song bits. Basil Rathbone is the perfect evil villian, and Kaye is perfect as a bumbling peasant pressed into service to overthrow the villainous King. If you don't buy this because you mistakenly expect an old comedy to be boring, tiresome, or dated, then you'll be missing out on a lot of laughs."
positive,"Good sports bra for the price: I've used this bra for several years. They are well constructed for the price point and I find them well supportive for high impact activities. Because I am bigger now after having kids ( went from a 36C to 38C/D), I find a little bit of a ""uniboob"" problem than before kids."
positive,"A whimsical and humorous adventure with memorable characters: I read this book as a child, and recently succeeded in finding it again (having forgotten the title.) Good Luck Arizona Man is the story of a white boy raised by Apaches, trying to discover the secrets of his own past and heritage while keeping his Apache identity. He goes on a search for the lost gold of the Apaches, which is tied up with his own mystery. Unfortunately, the mountains are filled with bizarre and dangerous white men also searching for the gold: and the Apache chief has sent men to ensure that the prophesy (he who finds the gold must die) comes trueThe book is humorous and whimsical, with many surprising plot twists. I doubt that the portrait of Apache life and customs is very accurate, but the white men are equally ridiculous. In any case, the characters (and their names--Head Toter, Tied-Up, Miss Utter Delight, Fantail and Poop, Old Wickiup, Missing Toe) are hilarious and unforgettable."
negative,i dont like this at all: My friend daughters loves this and she said i had to have it when i was pregnanat with my daughter.i really do not like it. its not an intresting toy. she never paid an attention to it. also it eats batteries which i hated too. but i really hated the most that it had no remote system at all. the music only plays for ten minutes and it has no remote so just as she was starting to quiet down it would go turn off and you have to go in there and turn it back on which would make her cry again. i stopped turning at all. nows she is 21 months and she turns it on by her self but the batteries go so fast i had to take it out and i dont use it any more. glo worm has same type of product but it plays up to 20 mins and she likes that one.
positive,"Get the 3.0 limited edition: I looked all over for a CD set that would have darn near every hit of Elvis', and this seems to be it (better than the ""official"" ""Elvis #1 Hits"", as that one for some reason doesn't have ""Viva Las Vegas"" (!?)).But, get the 3.0 edition of this (golden cover, eco-friendly cardboard packaging), because that has a third disc with ""Let Me Be Your Teddy Bear"", among others."
negative,"look cheaper than i thought: it is a good product, but it looks like very cheap transparent plastic, i just got one to try them befor getting the whole set of sizes, but kept only the one."
positive,"Keeps my baby nice and dry!: These are a great price. Keep my son dry. Could not be happier! I also highly rec joining the ""Mom's Club"" and you save a lot of money :)"
negative,"better choice out there: Try Barrons Math Workbook, it's much more organized and comprehensive. There is a lot of empty space with this Kaplan book."
negative,"why would they even sell VHS?!: I clicked on DVD, it brought me here, I was tired didn't pay attention and got the VHS, no one watches VHS why would they put gladiator on VHS? best movie ever but craziest thing ever."
positive,"Convenient spout lid, superior contruction: I have been using this product for a couple years now, and have been pleased with its performance. The innovative spout lid may take some people a bit of time to get used to (opening by lifting the handle), but it is convenient and well-made. The spout lid can remain open on its own if you want to stop the whistling.The contruction is solid and superior, like for many of the other OXO products. The handle is solidly attached to the body, unlike some other brands I have used where there were screws that came loose."
positive,"Practical, enjoyable and worth it.: This was well worth the investment. While based in simple principles stated succinctly it allows you to motivate yourself in the car on the way to work, at night before bed... anywhere ... any time. That repition and ease of listening starts making the ""100 ways to motivate yourself"" become ingrained at you start living them without making a consciencious effort."
positive,"Amazing details, feel like you're on board: I can watch this over and over. The blu-ray transfer is very good. The music doesn't get in the way, love the crew's personal tapes, the spoken comments make me feel like I'm there in all the scenes. The comments are not silly high-minded bragging nor sensationalism. There is humor. Above all, it is human, just technical facts and human thoughts. The presentation may be out of proper historical order of the flights now and then but it isn't a big factor.I watched moon walks on color tv, live from the moon, back in those days. I also watched people who wouldn't watch the live tv from the moon at all. Strange.Some of the lunar scenes are staggering, at least for me. Driving on the Lunar car rover is incredible.I wonder how young people today will view this blu-ray documentary. I suggest this is for them."
positive,"Great: If you're looking to give it another try, make sure to buy this book. The author has plenty of experience with getting hitched, in fact, I can't think of anyone who's been married more than Pamela Hill Nettleton, maybe Elizabeth Taylor. But since Liz hasn't written a book on the subject, I'll leave it up to Nettleton. I'm a divorced kid with parent who are both remarried. It's important to keep the kids in mind when trying it again, and Nettleton makes sure you don't look over that point. Did I mention funny? Going through marriage four times has to be difficult, but with Nettleton's humor it's just more material."
negative,"Breakage and stress: 2 out of the first 10 used broke, and I'm not even close to well endowed. Thanks for an unreliable product and unneeded stress..."
negative,"AWFUL!!!!!!!!!: It was a big disapointment! I thought it would be good, but it was boring and confusing. I consider myself a good reader, but this book took me forever to finish! Please trust me and don't waste your money on this horrible book!"
negative,"Don't Waste Your Time: Do not waste your time viewing this. The first half hour has virtually no dialogue, just images of Blake (meant to be Cobain ) wandering through the woods and his home. There is a cast of ""freeloaders"" living with Blake, none of whom add anything to the film what so ever. If you are expecting to see a biopic on Cobain, this movie offers nothing of the kind. Blake spends most of the film in a stuppor, and the only part remotely interesting is a bizarre visit from a represenative of the Yellow Pages attempting to get an add renewal for a locomotive Co. Blake was advertising. Fans of movies like The Doors and Almost Famous will certainly feel the dissapointment that I did."
positive,"Rare combination of style and substance: The Bad Sleeps Well is near-perfection: from the showy introduction of the wedding banquet to the riveting conclusion of BAD-man Iwabuchi's (Mori in an almost unrecognisable role) phonecall. The impression here is corruption knows no end --- whichever way you go on the hierarchy of the power structure.Most of the ""Kurosawa familiy"" of actors are here, but Akira Nishimura as Shirai brings a touch of humor (perhaps a perverse kind on the viewer's part) to his torture sequence. Takeshi Kato also gets to express himself more than his role in High and Low allows. Much of the film has a ""Western"" overtone - down to rich playboy Tatsuo's game of hunting, and the interior of the ruined factory that's reminiscent of dungeons in WWII films...oh boy. You won't forget Nishii's (Mifune in restrained mode) whistling - masterfully used here for characterization and musical counterpoint.""He's no man! He's an official!"""
positive,"Officially the Best Odds-And-Ends Album Ever: This isn't a real Beatles album, but it sure plays better than some of them. This is essentially the five songs from the drug-induced movie of the same name, bundled with the Beatles' three hit singles from 1967, with their B-sides. In essence, this is a hits collection, featuring some of the best singles ever written. Paul's ""Penny Lane"" and John's ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" in particular, are both sumptuously orchestrated slices of pop nirvana, but the clear winner here is ""All You Need Is Love."" A must-have for any Beatles, I also suggest this disc to casual fans."
negative,Wrong.. don't buy: It's not the same as the one the brush comes with. The top spins but you loose the up down motion from the brushes under the spin part. cheap knock off I guess. spend more get the right one. :(
positive,"Producers everywhere take note!!: From the point of view of a producer - this album is a masterpiece. The official amazon review (posted above) is right on the money! As for the next review - sure, fat boy slim is more top 40 oriented, but that's not the point here. Don't buy this album thinking you're going to hear a ton of radio hits - buy this album knowing you're taking home a truly superb work of musical art. (of course, it's fun to kick tha' jams on ""Bodyrock"" too!!)"
negative,"a sleeping pill: Like other Rhea's books, this one put me to sleep after a few pages. I tried again when I woke up, and I found that Randall's verbose style is poor and technically inaccurate, to the point that his book is confusing at times."
negative,Hinges break easily: I had my unit for a year and the plastic hinge broke.I recommend getting and using the optional leather carrying case at all times because it helps protect the hinge somewhat. My hinge broke after a day I was carrying around my gps unit but didn't have my leather case with me.However I think the hinge started getting more loose after about 9 months of use because the flip cover started falling off my pda occaisionaly after about 9 months of use.Even when using the leather case you'll still want to use the flip cover. The leather case is softer and if you don't have the flip cover on inside the case there a good chace your unit's on button will get pressed on inside your pocket and the pda battery will get drained. The flip case is more rigid and it helps prevent the on button from accidently getting turned on while you are carring the pda inside the leather case.
negative,"Looks good on blu-ray: Hmmmmmm, a few thoughts come to mind, gruesome,goulish,bloody. If you like that, then you will love this. It has a good plot, movie keeps you on your toes, but the blood and gore in the movie is apparent and graphic. Not suitable for children, period!"
negative,"How Disappointing: The first few books of the Mitford series were wonderful, but the last two have been such disappointments. I love the Mitford story line, but Light from Heaven was so dis-jointed, it felt like JK got tired of writing and just haphazardly jotted down some disconnected thoughts. I really expected more -a gread deal more - from an author who clearly can touch the hearts of her readers, but really missed the mark this time."
positive,"Some of the best writing ever: I wish I were more proficient in Spanish so as to be able to read this novel as GGM put it to paper. I can't even begin to compare the prose, the images invoked, to any other writer I've been exposed to; they just don't compare to Marquez. I'm reading it for the 4th or 5th time and can't put it down. The words just seamlessly fall into place in snyc with my thoughts and imagination. That part of this novel is a wonderous experience. As to the content, the Buendias are a family I've become familiar with and increasingly revolted by. Behind all of Marquez's dense fog of magical prose is the sick reality of this family. I understand the intent, but didn't really pay it any attention until the 2nd reading or so. It's animalistic, barbaric, incestuous, and callous; it's a fairly tale on heroin. If you enjoy the style and prose this will be one of your favorite books, but you'll only know if it clicks with you if you give it a try."
negative,"this is not the way to change things.: a friend of mine had said this book was ab-soul-lutely stunning, and i'm disappointed to say it was anything but. The vast majority of the text is spent pointing fingers at various groups who are seen by Souljah to be opressing the African-American woman, and yet she doesen't go into any real solutions to the problems. I, being a black lesbian, was extremely offended by her outright homophobic comments in the book, and had to try to get through them without throwing it away. I ended up throwing it away anyway at the end. Feel like revolution? Listen to Me'Shell Ndegeocello. Don't buy this book."
negative,"20-Questions Handheld Game - Big Disappointment: This game, although somewhat fun, is very limited in its capacity. The only way that the game is able to guess the item about which you are thinking, is if you choose something (an object, etc.) that is very simple, and that you can describe with great accuracy. Otherwise, the game guesses your thoughts incorrectly most of the time. It is not very sophisticated, and is truly not worth the money. In other words, do not buy this product."
negative,"Hopkins 46365 will not work on 2006 Mercedes E320 CDI: I ordered the Hopkins 46365 unit since it was recommended along with the hitch I purchased for my vehicle. Upon installation, the LED trailer lights worked but were very dim. The measured voltage was only 3.4 volts at the lights. I returned the unit and ordered a Curt Model 56146. (Thank you Amazon!) The Curt unit works flawlessly with bright lights with the identical installation. The Mercedes has an advanced lighting system and only the Curt Model 56146 worked on my car."
positive,"Works!: I have used this product in the past and works fine. A little effort to fill, but not too difficult and better than buying new or having someone else fill."
positive,"Couldn't finish it~: The fist few chapters didn't hold my interest so I never finished the book. I'm probably what many insecure men would consider a ""bitch"" because I say what I mean and mean what I say, so it didn't ""divulge"" anything new to me. Maybe for the timid and shy, but not for us ""strong women""! :)"
positive,Great Diapers: I love pampers diapers. I have two boys and have used pampers almost exclusively. They have fantastic leak protection and fit my boys better than other brands.
positive,kd live by request: Best video of a kd lang show I've seen. She was energetic and funny while maintaining her awesome capability to control her voice. Recorded at John Jay College in New York in Dec 2000. Outstanding show presented by A & E channel.
negative,"Not so deep: Almost every book that Denby defends so wholeheartedly in this book is worth reading. Still, his exploration of the culture debates seems superficial. He is able to attend these classes and come out with basically the same opinions with which he left, having absorbed nothing of the justifiable rage of groups left out of the ""core curriculum"", smugly sure that the books he grew up with are the best that are out there. His dismissal of the liberal students' concern as ""tragically mistaken"" seems glib and self-satisfied, and the book is tainted by the bias of its author, whose purpose (to re-educate himself, to find himself) is defeated from the start by his closed-mindedness."
negative,"It is only one of the mot boring books ever publihed: I have to read this book for school, and it is boring, dull, puts you to sleep after 2 pages.....exc.....exc....exc....... Dantes need to fugure out who he is....he must be 6 peple in his story.....but it did bite that he got arrested for that letter though..... Those guys were jerks.."
positive,"This is a terrific manager's resource.: Bill Lee has done something truly remarkable. He has written a book that while jam-packed with practical information for managers, reads like a best-seller. I couldn't put it down. The author writes in such a direct and engaging way that the experience of reading this terrific book feels almost as if you are having a conversation or consultation with him. The book has 30 chapters. Master them and you will put 30 top-notch management tools in your briefcase. This author clearly knows his stuff, and he knows how to explain it with no wasted words. The six appendices are worth the price of the book alone. If you are -- or would be -- a manager who would like to work more effectively, achieve at higher levels, and get better results on your bottom line, the first thing you should do is get yourself a copy of ""30 Ways Managers Shoot Themselves in the Foot."" You won't regret it."
positive,"material is great: love shirt goes perfect with tennis shoes the fit is comfortable ,material is soft great price would definely recommend product"
positive,It was captivating and it almost addictive.READ IT!: J.R.R. Tolkien has made his best work in The Hobbit. It was almost addictive how he sets the mood for the next chapter. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bilbo is detailed so well it is just like a movie and his description of the characters is astounding. The story just hooks you from the time of the party at Bilbo's home. I loved it and would recommend it for anyone with a sense of magination and adventure.
positive,"Do Not Drive While Listening To This!: I too almost ran off the road while listening to ""The Love Master""! In fact, just sitting down may not be safe enough--I couldn't even BREATHE for a minute. Keep the oxygen handy."
negative,"and now a delux edition ...why: What a terrible movie,Reeves is just horrible and boring in this role.Maybe a spectacle for the kids but I think this film would put most inteligent adults to sleep or just prompt them to hit the eject button.Watching this really is like a trip into hell !!"
negative,"1906 edition: This is a reprint of the 1906 edition. Linotype and monotype were recent technological innovations. The Helvetica typeface was 50 years in the future. No one had yet thought of using endnotes rather than footnotes. A hyphen is recommended in cases such as: ice-cream, wave-length, common-sense, fountain-head, and view-point.A mildly amusing antique, but not useful for anyone actually doing writing, editing, or publishing."
positive,"REICHS RULES THE MEDICAL EXAMINER COMPETITION!: Sorry Cornwell, but Temperance Brennan is a lot better of a character than Kay Scarpetta. In Kathy Reichs's novels there are no soap opera whining periods like Cornwell likes to do. Dr. Tempe is on the hunt for a killer who burned down a house in Quebec. There were four people inside the house, all burned alive. As Tempe investigates, she is greatly disturbed to discover a possible ""cult"" connection. In this fast-paced novel of thrills and murders, Reichs takes readers on a hunt from Quebec, Canada to North Carolina to try to stop this group of evil cult members before they kill again. The only part that I didn't like about this novel was that in Tempe's free time, she investigated a century year old remains of some religious member at a local church. That part could have been cut of the novel. Overall, ""Death DeJour"" is a worthwile read!"
negative,couldn't give it more stars: I haven't been able to get into it ...read only a bit and it hasn't held my attention...maybe I'll try again sometime... I know it is supposed to be like a classic so try it ....
positive,A Lot of Leverage from a small book: short powerful encouraging quotes from inspirational Christian leaders woven through many uplifting bible verses. Great to give to a friend who needs encouragement. Excellent!!
negative,"Poor quality.: I bought this shelf because it was the only one I could find that was (a) wood, (b) white, and (c) less than 20 inches long. Most wooden shelves on the market are longer.The shelf does not sit well on the wall. To install it, you first have to attach a wooden peg to the wall, and then you push/slide the shelf onto that peg. The problem is that the shelf does not fit tightly to the peg, which makes the shelf a little wobbly. It slopes down towards you instead of being perfectly straight. That is, if you put a marble in the middle it would slowly come back to you instead of sitting in the middle.Also, I bought two of these and one was defective. The peg didn't fit into the shelf because it was not cut properly. I called customer service at the company to request a new peg and they said they would ship a new shelf. That was weeks ago and I haven't received anything yet. I'm not holding my breath.So steer clear of this product."
negative,"Good Vocalist,but sleepy time music: Amel Larrieux is a Really Good Vocalist&has a nice tune,but this album makes me real Sleepy Time. the Production&arrangements don't challenge or match the vocals that she presents. Amel should be having a Alicia Keys type of Career run now as to being stuck with tired formulated tracks by the numbers."
negative,"Pretentious: ""I came to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Ministry of Education . . ."" indeed! Feiler has a very high opinion of himself. And isn't it a bit inappropriate for a teacher to kiss the hand of a junior high girl, let alone a junior high girl of another culture? I've been reading a lot of Japanese non-fiction and travel essays since a recent visit to Japan and so far this book ranks low in terms of enjoyment, educational value and insight because of its pretentious tone."
negative,"Ignore: The real Kinsey was no 'hero'; he used stats for his 'study' on the sexual response of children - the information he took from one source, a convicted paedophile's own journal.With such scientific 'backing' as this, the real Kinsey then published these derranged fantasies as fact."
positive,"Helps my baby sleep.: We used this at nap and bed time since by son was born. Now that he is 16 months, if he wakes in the night he ""fishboxes"" himself! He hits the large blue button and the music soothes him back to sleep. When he was younger we joked that we needed a remote control to start it back up when he would wake up.My only complaint is that it seems to eat the batteries pretty well."
negative,"nothing is what it seems to be: The product does not worth the price,and the texture of it is too thick.It's definitly not a day cream because the way it looks on your face, unless you don't mind going out there looking all green;and is unconfourtable to sleep with because it's also sticky.I'm sorry but that's how it is."
positive,"Amazing!: Very pleased with this book. Absolutely loved Bilbos adventures; meeting with trolls, dragons, goblins and especially Gollum. The world is all right at the moment because I have discovered how Bilbo acquired the one ring. Now time to see the movie!! I recommend this book to all those who need a break from the real world, slip into another world full of adventure. This read will enlighten and fulfill all your senses. Proving that those thought to be small and useless to be courageous, intelligent and trully heroic!"
negative,Thoughts on A Modern Magician: Sadly both A Modern Magician & it's sequel A Calculated Magic have not aged well. They both feel very 80's
negative,"Weird: I like Michael Rapaport, but this movie disappoints. The plot is flat and confusing at times, not to mention boring. I don't mind slow movies if they have a point, but this one doesn't. And he doesn't really fight evil as I expected after reading the description.. all he really ends up doing is defending himself. The part where he's locked in the bathroom all night is just plain ridiculous. I mean, obviously if someone is beat up within an inch of his life, the girl would have called 911 for him, right? And Alexandra Holden's stutter was totally unbelievable. I've liked her in other roles I've seen her in, but she does not pull this one off. Two thumbs 'WAY down on this one.Oh yes, And I agree with the reviewer who said they were glad they didn't buy this title. I feel the same way... even a penny would be too expensive for this crude film."
negative,"In war, this cd is played as torture to make prisoners talk.: This cd is the worst cd I've ever purchased... wait... I didn't even buy it... somebody lent it to me and they didn't want it back... I would NOT reccomend buying this cd to ANYONE... but if you have some money you wanna get rid of, you can buy mine..."
negative,"pretty but delicate: this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is ""rolling"" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily. Also, there are two gold bands, and one silver band, instead of three different colored bands (gold, rose and silver, etc), which would have made more sense. The two gold, one silver just looks odd. I got a lot of compliments the first few days I had the ring, but after that the gems fell out, so, I don't wear it at all."
positive,"great tent for kids: I bought this and the connecting tunnel for my 5 year old and 1 year old twins...They love it and can play in it for hours...It is a bit large for inside, but if you have the room. ..."
negative,"Headache, anyone? Thanks, but no thanks.: Well, this has to be one of the most disappointing releases of the year. Actually, I wasn't expecting much, so I wasn't that disappointed, but to fans of Clay, I will warn you that this CD is not what you would expect. Clay sounds more robot than man on this debut effort, and I do mean EFFORT. He is a good singer, but he belongs on Broadway, singing show tunes to the elderly who can revel in his youth and energetic manner. To the average listener, this CD is no more than a sad recycled mess of false emotion. It wouldn't matter so much if it were on Broadway, because the show distracts you somewhat, but I would be careful putting this disc in your CD player. I got a headache after the first song. Anyone want to buy a used copy? I might have to take the scissors to it otherwise..."
positive,"I Hope You Dance is GREAT: May 19th of 2000, my good friend died in a car accident. This song has helped me and the victim's family get through this tragic accident. I recommend this song to anyone. The words just say everything."
positive,"Gladiator: Gladiator is a movie that grips you and inspires the audience. I am not a person who goes to the movies frequently. Even a good movie I seldomly see more than twice on the big screen (Saving Private Ryan was a two-fer), but Gladiator I was draw to three times. Russell Crowe did a fantastic job establishing his charactor. He commanded respect and admiration because he was so humble and sincere, yet extremely skilled and courageous as a soldier. The cinematographing was well done and the battle scenes and story line gripping. Historically, it takes some liberties here and there. The biggest weakness of the movie is Maximus' transition from fugitive to slave, but other than that, Gladiator is a movie you'll walk away from thinking about your own moral fiber."
positive,"Very Good Read on 8th Air Force B-24 Missions: I really enjoyed this book. I have read several autobiographies and accounts of aerial combat in the ETO and this is one of the best. The author describes his experiences in details that kept me aware of what was going on and how he felt.Also, it was a great read about the ""other"" bomber in the ETO, i.e. the B-24 Liberator.Thanks Keith!"
positive,love this!: Love love love this toy! My baby loves it. I even bought another because it is hard to find. It has crinkly ears and feet. It also had a bell in its head and the bone vibrates. It has all my baby's favorite toys in one toy! Plus it is covered in tags and my son loves tags. Best baby toy ever. It is also easy for him to hold.
positive,"Magnificently compelling...: This is a wonderfully entertaining, well-written and thought provoking story. The author did a superb job of developing character and plot, leaving the reader with a lust for the story to continue."
negative,"Painful Experience: These Razors must be factory seconds. It was painful to use the blades. They were course and hurt my face. I did not get a clean Gillette Shave. Felt like old blades I would have thrown out, but they did have new green ruber indicator strips. I ended up throwing them away. Not the usual Fusion Experience. I tried to order these online because I thought I could save a few bucks. I might still try ordering them from amazon, but never again from these guys."
positive,Early Flying: I'm interested in early flight and this book gave an eyewitness account which I enjoyed.
negative,"This book was a very big disappontment: This book was a very big disappontmet. I thought this book could have had a couple minor plot changes. I also thought the way the main charictor, Pip, transfored through his expectations was shallow and padanthic. To conclude, I belive that the chapters are cycled like story line with many charictors and an entire chapter with Pip talking to himself and talking about his expectations. Thank you for reading my review."
negative,"Microsoft no longer supports this game...DON'T BUY IT!!!: Microsoft no longer provides telephone support for this game. They only provide support for Zoo Tycoon 2. Since I have a new Service Pack for XP this product won't even run on my PC, They neglected to tell customers this as well. And still they allow suppliers to sell the game to anyone..... Boo Microsoft!! Get your money back now!!!"
negative,"Disturbing: I'm a true Jane Austen fan....have read every book many times over and watched every BBC production. I was completely put off by the sight of Anne Hathaway's thong underwear showing through her cotton nightgown in the candlelight. Am I only one disturbed by this? For me, this was like reading a huge type-o in a pretty good book. It stopped me dead, I couldn't enjoy the rest of the movie and it's the only thing about the film that stands out in my mind. I'm pretty sure that's what editing is for...but maybe this movie's editors didn't know that it was extremely unlikely that ladies wore thongs in Jane Austen's day."
negative,"2 Bluesy: This album is wat too bluesy. I don't understand Eric Clapton's diabloical obsession with the blues. The blues is silly and outdated. So is this album. There are a couple of standout tracks, but most of it is just psychedelic blues. GIBBERISH! That's what most of this is! GIBBERISH! Who cares whether the blues dummy feels free or not? I for one, do not."
negative,not a legit distributor: This is in violation of herbalife website hosting requriements. Prices can only be shown to registered customers. I will be reporting this to herbalife. If you want a real herbalife distributor then go to [...]
negative,"Does not run on some DVD players: I can run the DVD on a laptop computer, but it will not run on a 2011 DVD player or a 2009 DVD player."
positive,"Great photography, good breed background, a little generic: I bought and read this book prior to acquiring my first Tibetan Terrier. You could not possibly find nicer photograph. The pictures really jump out of the book. The background on how Tibetans came to England and then America was interesting and just thorough enough not to lose a person new to the breed. The only major criticism I have is that I felt more breeders' and owners' voices should have been included. This is a wonderful breed of dog with many quirks. I would like to have read more about more people's impressions."
positive,"Perfect Rice, Quirky User Interface: I'm guessing that for Japanese, this user interface is easier to navigate. For Americans the interface is quirky and the manual is a bit hard to understand, something like all Japanese products used to be when they started to get popular. But once you learn how it works, you can get perfect rice any time and that's worth a lot.The one REALLY annoying thing about this device though is that you can't tell how many minutes are left to cook until it's nearly done. It may be because it doesn't know, but all you have is some time estimates in the manual. This can be a problem in meal planning, but it really does a good job on the rice."
positive,"Bela Goes Batty!: Dr. Paul Carruthers (Bela Lugosi) is a scientist who invents new fragrances for a successful aftershave maker. His failure to invest in the company has left him without the millions he feels he deserves. Carruthers is a bitter man who has sworn revenge. How? Does he plan to sue for his fair share of the profits? Nah, the sinister doc creates a small army of giant, mutant, killer bats to exact his vengeance! These fuzzy monsters are attracted by a new aftershave lotion he's formulated in his secret laboratory. He gets his intended targets to splash some on their faces. One by one, the victims are attacked, their throats ripped out by soaring, shrieking, stuffed devil bats! Bela is priceless as always. This movie belongs in every horror collection..."
positive,GREAT!!!: I have had a few bags in the past.. and kick one around once in a while with my friends. I have to say that the weight that the sand gives this bag is really great. It's excellent for stalls and tricks and just kicking it around to kill time.
negative,"Bought it used and part of the back of the book was torn in half: This is a great book, especially if you actually understand the symbolism. However, I bought it ""used and in good shape."" It was NOT in good shape. The last probably 25 or so pages looked like a dog had chewed it to shreds. I could read some of the pages, but others were completely confusing without the other half. I would recommend this book, but I would not recommend that you buy it used."
positive,"Dysfunctional family farce: When the father of a completely dysfunctional family dies, members of his extended family arrive to give him a dignified send off, but, with such a family, it turns into an English Drawing room farce. The oldest son,Daniel and his wife, live with the deceased and his wife and from the start, things go awry. The wrong body is in the coffin and sets the scene for all the other scenes. One of the younger family members is manufacturing and selling halucinogenic pills and unwittingly allows them to be mistaken for Valium with the expected results and one of the eldest members of the family is a cranky, bad tempered old devil who has an unfortunate episode of loss of bowel control which really made me heave! I didn't enjoy this movie as much as 4 weddings and a funeral, but the writing was excellent and the cast were first rate."
negative,"This applies only to the error-ridden Kindle version: The book is great, and the Kindle price is very low ($1.99 as I write this). However, the Kindle file is riddled with errors: typos, bad returns, sentences run together, no table of contents. There's nothing like reading a great book and having the experience marred by a terrible translation to a new medium. I would have happily paid more for a decent, readable version of the book."
positive,Behind the Eyes: A darker side of Amy. Probably written and recorded when her marriage was falling apart. Very insiteful.
negative,"Done with Dune: Like many others, I picked up DUNE based on its broadly accepted status as a SF classic. I don't read much SF, so I try to get to the Big Books (War of the Worlds, Ender's Game, Fahrenheit 451, ""The Year's Best"" anthologies, etc). This was not a good book. The dialogue is stilted, the characters are caricatures, and everyone's always ""hissing"", ""glaring"", or ""swallowing with a dry throat"". The plot is interesting enough, but not nearly as complex or Byzantine as I had expected: warring factions, religious fervor, double-crossing, nefarious rulers, ulterior motives - standard stuff, really. If anything, the plot seems complicated because we're told so little about what the Guild, the Great Houses, and CHOAM really are. Anyway, as a non-SF connoisseur I realize that I don't get to vote on which books are the classics. But from where I stand, DUNE is a poorly-written, lackluster, repetitive tale. It's not the best SF I've ever read; it's not even the best book I've read this month."
positive,It's nice: it's nice. Very nice. Good indeed. I like it. Nathaniel Hawthorne. Exciting. Yes. Do you agree? Hester. Dimmesdale. Pearl. Chillingworth.
positive,"Magnum opus: This is a lively, energetic and realistic account of life in the 1846 American West. Parkman's ""Oregon Trail"" is considered a timeless, historical masterpiece and rightfully so. Only twenty three years old, he and his friend Quincy Adams Shaw went west ""on a tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains"". Stopping off at Fort Laramie, we acquire a taste of what life was like there in those early days of overland emigrants, trappers, traders, Indians and ""ruffians"". He then spends time with the Sioux, observing and describing their behavior, culture and customs while in the Laramie Mountains and Valley, and the foothills of the Medicine Bow Mountains. From here, Parkman and Shaw travel down the front range of Colorado to Pueblo, Bent's Fort and back to St. Louis via the Arkansas River. Being a very descriptive writer, we gain an insightful and vivid look as to geographical landforms and the characters who lived in those days. Excellent."
positive,"holy crap.: This book was so incredibly scary. It could've been just me being scared easily, but they should change the name of tis book to ""Stories to Scare th Crap out of Kids""Seriously."
positive,Great business primer: The information in this book has helped me focus on what i need to know as a manager. Working with the different demands and needs of other personnel creates tension in your workplace.
positive,It was wonderful!!: This was exactly what I needed to pass the registry!! About 80-90% of the registry is in this book!! I wouldn't have made it without it!!
negative,"Disappointed in the representation of the product: I did NOT read anywhere in your write-up that this DVD was in Italian. I wrote to the seller and asked if it could be used in the U.S. and he said it could just change the regional or country code. (But you have to have an ""all regional"" player to be able to use it that I did not know at the time.) So, I opened it and it did not work so now I am stuck with a product that we cannot use. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU HAVE AN ""AND ALL REGIONAL PLAYER"" so you can change the region."
positive,"Buy it!!: I love this movie. I have seen it several times, and it is a great addition to any home library. (That's my criteria - no point in buying a movie if seeing it once is enough<G>)The love story is genuine, the music is great, and the dancing is out of this world!Also captures the times of the 'Borscht Circuit' hotels in the Catskills much as 'Marjorie Morningstar' did."
positive,"An Ageless Film: I first saw this amazing movie about seven years ago on TV and had to have it. Through the years I have grown, matured, and have moved off to colllege, but still find this to be one of the best stories I have had the pleasure to watch. The morals presented along with the well developed story line make even a student of theatre appreciate the basic root of entertainment that The Last Unicorn has to offer. If you ever need to just sit back, unwind, and let go of reality for a world of fantasy for a little while, The Last Unicorn will indeed make you smile."
positive,Fantastic book: Eragon is the book I say is Fantastic. Its by a kid that was therteen years old.His name is Cristopher Paolinis. The book is about a boy Fifteen years old. who was poor and lived with his uncle and cusin. One day he whent to the Spine to hunt. In the Spine he finds a blue stone. he brings it home and falls asleep. The rock starts shaking and a dragon cracks out of the rock.further in the book he becomes a rider and fights the king so every body can be free. If he survives and the war you have to read this owsome book
positive,Works well!: I was hoping for something a little thicker (hard to shop online) but it has been protecting my face very well in this below 20 weather in Philadelphia when I bike several miles to work. I definitely would recommend this product!
positive,"A great guide to Christianity: I always like books by C.S. Lewis. He has a grasp of the Grace of God and Christian doctrine like not too many others have in our day and age anymore. Every reader of this book can get valuable insight and learn a lot. I think I also discovered the next 'C.S. Lewis' as I read a very inspirational book, which has helped me tremendously in my spiritual understanding and growth, as well as in my personal relationship with Jesus Christ, which is Diemtar Scherf's 'I Love Me: Avoiding & Overcoming Depression'--also available at Amazon."
positive,"Unique and Captivating China: High quality, light weight and uniquely interesting pattern. Adds fun to the dining experience and cleans up like a dream in the dishwasher. Arrived in absolutely perfect condition and was packaged exceptionally well."
negative,"Never quite worked for me: I was really excited about adding these to my cardio workout, just to add a bit of weight without feeling it too much. That was the idea anyway. The issue is they didn't fit well, and there was no way to adjust them. I'm a 6'1"" tall woman with the proportions to go with the height, so I'm not dainty. These were tight on my wrists from the start. I wore them a few times thinking with use the material would stretch a bit, but the material just came apart at the seams and the sand inside started to spill out. Even then it wasn't THAT tight, I wouldn't have thought it would just fall apart. Even if they did fit I imagine they wouldn't last very long.For smaller people these will work out fine, but for people who are more robust, including most men, these simply won't work out very well. I wish the adjustable kind came in lighter weights."
positive,"Very Cool!: Okay, some of the long time fans of QOFTSA are not sold on this becase Oliveri is gone. While Oliveri is a great bass player I can honestly say I do not miss his ""death metal"" vocals. Granted this CD is different from ""Songs..."" but still great. It took me a couple of times through before this CD really struck a note with me. Now I really love it. Lullabies"" is not as heavy overall as ""Songs.."" but I feel as a whole these songs in a lot of ways are stronger. Check out ""Burn The Witch"". Listen to this tune a couple of times and you want be able to get it out of your head. Totally cool groove on this song. As I said it is different from ""Songs..."" but still very good. Check it out."
negative,"Loved the style, but the content....not so much: To read the plot summary off the cover, you would have thought that this was a lovely poignant classic, along the lines of ""Little House"" or something. Just sounded so sweet. It wasn't. I got tired of the over the top, bizarre sexual scenarios, they were perverted and so unnecessary to the otherwise compelling story. It seemed so forced as if the author thought it vital to the selling of the book to throw in various gratuitous sex scenes. Nothing like the style of story you would think you were getting from the paragraph descriptions above on this book. I got half way through the book and gave up....wasted time. Very disappointed."
positive,"Fun Game: I got this game used at GameStop. I would get to a certain part of the map and it would freeze on me every time. The game had minor scratches of course. So I ordered one from Amazon. I'm more into Gears of War, Call of Duty, and Halo than anything else. But the first time I played this game it was fun. I love the fact you can make your car bounce and crash into other cars. It's alot of fun with the different types of ways to play this game. The only thing I don't like is you don't get chased by cops. Which would make it more fun."
positive,"fun for the whole family: This video representation of the hobbit is excellent. I am playing Gollum in my school play, and the move keeps up wonderfully with the original diologue. The whole family can enjoy this movie whether they are familiar with the book or not."
negative,"Sends a bad message: I read all the business and management books that I can find and this is by far the worst I have ever seen. The main character spends the entire book devoting his life to improving at his job after he makes a mediocre presentation to a client. In the end he finally presents the results of all his hard work to his supervisor. When she reacts positively, he stammers ""you mean you are not going to fire me?"" Are you kidding me? He showed he is as dedicated an employee as there ever was and worked like crazy to get better at his job. After all his dedication he ends up with very little self confidence. And even worse, his boss replies, ""I can't afford to fire you."" She jokes about how much they have invested in his training. Unbelievably bad book, the writing is very sophmoric, and the overall message is one of self doubt, groveling, and low self confidence. Save your money and avoid this book!"
negative,"Heed The Warnings: One of the reasons I like buying on Amazon is because of these reviews. Usually I can get a feeling about a movie by the reviews it receives....Unfortunately I bought this on sale as a ""Previously Viewed"" before I ever checked out the reviews. The fact that they list on the cover that 2 of the writers worked on Scary Movie naturally made me think this had to be good because all of the Scary Movies have been roll on the floor funny. This movies does have some funny parts to it, but not enough to really want spend much money or time on it.The JayLo bit has been over done for some time before the movie came out so the giagantic rear end bit just comes across as silly nonsense....As with much of the movie...."
negative,"Gross: Ironside themes do not a great album make. Even worse are the puerile child singers - the themes are ghastly and the singing OMG!If you are high on crack this might be cool. Me, I love Archie's music from 62 to 70, this music is CRAP. Strangely, Things Have Go to Change was amazing - Archie you had it in you to be greatImpulse wanted a hit LP this was never going to be it!!!! Archie was misled or not up to say NO!!!!!!"
positive,"Cloud Of Death is a winner all the way!: Mack Bolan is back,tough and cool,in the second book of the Four Horsemen Trilogy. Bolan takes on a cult,bikers and terrorists. The Millennium angle, adds a fresh and current depth to the book.The ending is exciting and intense. Mike Newton writes another atmospheric Bolan novel, that works. Check it out."
positive,Climbing Block: I use this climbing block in combination with my tech trainer for my indoor winter biking workout. I like this block for positioning and stablility during my workout.
negative,"Will NOT work on an iPOD: I am very disappointed with this CD's inability to download effectively to my iPOD for my listening pleasure. This is a political issue between Sony and Apple and nothing to do with technology. This is a major upswelling of displeasure over this issue. Search the internet for ""Sony DRM Software"" and you will get tons of articles covering this issue. If you live with your iPOD than this is NOT the CD for you."
negative,"Astonishing Mistake!: Darwin never wrote a book titled 'The origin of the species'. His bookwas published under two titles: 'The origin of species', and 'On the origin ofspecies'. Both also had subtitles. The term `the species' has sometimes beenused by creationists as a synonym for `human beings', and they incorrectlyrefer to Darwin's book as `The origin of the species', implying that it isabout the origin of humans. Of course, it is not. It is about the origin ofspecies - duh. Publishing a book with this incorrect title helps support the creationists' misrepresentation of Darwin. Amazon should not sell this book unless thetitle is corrected."
negative,"a big disappointment: I was a HUGE Clay fanatic after all the AI hype. I watched the show religiously and was completely in love with Clay and his voice. And I was very excited when his full length CD came out.But, I was rather disappointed with it. It is a bunch of cheesy ""love"" songs. I can honestly say that the young Clay fans will probably love it, but I am thouroughly disappointed with it. I like the song Measure of a Man, and Invisible is kinda catchy (but kind of creepy, like a stalker song). I just expected more from Clay. I still think that he has an amazing ""live"" voice, but I don't like his ""studio"" voice."
negative,"WHY???????????????????????????????????????????????????: WHY are poor, innocent school kids forced to read this intensly dull text? It is enough to put anyone off English Lit for LIFE. If anyone in authority is reading this, PLEASE take this piece of junk OFF the sylabus...PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"Casting The First Stone: ""Casting The First Stone"" was very realistic and also entertaining. I can certainly relate to the church situations addressed in this book. I found myself picking out parts of the story that coincided with real life incidents that we have experienced or others in the community. Ms. Roby really brought out the truth in this one. In my opinion, its one of the best book I have ever read and I highly recommend it."
positive,"Beyond Glory: This is the story of men who won the Congressional Medal of Honor. If you ever wondered what kind of men they were, this is the book for you. Each man's life is profiled, up to and beyond the event that defined their military life. The book ends with the actual words used when they were presented with the Medal. If you don't shed a few tears while reading this book, you don't have an ounce of patriotism.I thought it couldn't get better than the Medic who wouldn't bear arms, yet saved over 100 men single handedly in WWII, then I read the stories of ordinary men and real foul ups, who showed moments of profound bravery in the frozen Chosin Reservoir in Korea. I read the story of the longest held prisoner of war in Vietnam, horribly tortured, and of his wife, who led the crusade to finally get the men released. This is just an awesome book. You owe it to yourself and to your children, to read about the kind of people who have upheld this country against those who would destroy us."
negative,"A bit of a letdown: I guess I am in the minority. I thought the film was entertaining but I certainly don't think it deserves all the hoopla that's been going around. Visually, it didn't offer anything that was new. The plot was very different from the first but what I liked about the first one was the character development.....getting to know who these people are. In Spider 2, it seemed that there were so many maudlin moments that were unnecessary. Constantly telling the audience that things are bad. Alrgiht. I got the point. Move on. I thought the acting was very forced also. Too many tears for a comic book character. In fact, every character had some tears to shed at various points, even the bad guys, the supporting actors and the EXTRAS!!! C'mon. This is NOT heavy drama and could NEVER be construed as such so why throw it in so many times?"
positive,I love this book!: Great for family time with your sons and/or daughters. It offers scripture with a real-life application that can be shared with your children. It is perfect for that quiet time with your children and with your Lord.
negative,"little to much cussing for young listeners: Checked this out in my local library and funny enough it was in the children's section. We had listen to it before but our old radio would fade in and out while we listen to it painting. So, later when we had the chance again (now it was found in the adult section) so this time we would listen to it in the car, I was a bit shocked at the language on it. Even my 11 year old stated there was a *allot of cussing* on this tape. The stories are funny enough without the hard language. This tape/cd has no rating on it. It should be at least PG-13 to give parents a heads up for a younger listeners."
negative,"Offensive To Just ABout Everybody: Once again hollywood has created a film that denigrates Jews and African Americans. The film is full of stereotypes; happy guythat love to sing and rejoice, a big bad nigger that loves to fight. Of course, we don't really know his name because he constantly referred to as ""T-Bone."" Let's see what else, materialistic jews that lack spirituality and the good white christian who is real and feeling. I'm sorry but I do not find Stepinfetchit characterizations of black people funny, no matter how minor or superfluous the roles are in the films."
positive,"Thank you! Dr Rosenthal!: I purchased this cd's to pass my comprehensive examn during grad school and used it for my NCE test, I passed and I can't thank enough to this cd's and Dr. Rosenthal!!!"
positive,The Secret Door: This is a terrific version of the old-fashioned memory game with the bonus of being a co-operative game in which the players work together to find matches before time runs out. My children and I return to this game again and again! Makes a great gift game since everyone can enjoy the play! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
positive,"Don't Buy Your Wife One Or You'll Listen To All Day: The quality is good and the sound is very good. I don't use this thing, but my wife has really enjoyed it. We've had it for a long time and have not had any problems."
negative,"Black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...?: I honestly don't get the appeal of these books. Why bother making (or reading) black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...? I mean, yeah, the stories are still great and the original comics are hard to find, but a huge part of what made these comics great was the eye-popping artwork, including the bright primary colors: reading them in dull B&W; is just plain wrong. Sure, the printing costs are lower, so you can get more pages for your money, but it's more pages of boring, not more pages of fun. It's really a travesty.On the other hand, it recently occurred to me that these could be used as coloring books... Maybe you could buy a box of crayons to go along with all the artwork that the publishers ruined in this format. (Axton)"
negative,rip off waste of money.: Nothing in this joke of a book that did not come with my juicer. They should be ashamed of themselves. Ripping people off who are looking for help.
positive,Great CD: I love love love this CD. I dont speak french but its still great. I would recommend this CD to everyone.
positive,"""Excellent reference"": the item was shipped on time...received as what has promised...i bought this for my niece who is a nursing student...it's a very good reference book for nursing...brand new and received in good condition...thank you"
positive,"Fascinating but not an all-time great: The first 45 minutes of this movie are utterly compelling, quite shocking in many respects. But it proves difficult for the director and actors to sustain the pace and elements of surprise that galvanize the film at the start. Wonderful music, extraordinary performance by McDowell, and remarkably faithful to Burgess's book."
negative,"THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!: As a Detroit Red Wings fan, I must say that I loved this version of the Odyssey! This special effects were absolutly wonderful, and I must say I love the acting, some of the best i've ever seen in my life, almost better than sergey federov acting to get hit to draw a high sticking call! There was more action than Chelios misses checks! Oh, and there were more holes in this movie than Curtis Joseph leaves in his net. This movie was wodderful"
negative,"Absoulutely Horrible: Being an English AP student, I was given this book to read over the summer. I was hoping for a book with at least something enlightening or interesting in it, but I found this book to be nothing more than useless. Nothing can save this book from being what it is: overdramatic and overpraised. Jude is a pathetic loser, Sue has no control over her emotions, and they are both idiots. I was glad when the children hung themselves, as it was the single most entertaining part of the book. Who the hell names a kid ""Father Time"" anyway???? A tale of incest and stupidity..... forget it. read this book if you want to punish yourself. This book made me angry and will do so for any reasonable person that picks it up and makes it all the way through."
negative,"Characters are stagnant and boring. Not fun.: I cannot believe that this book has won awards. I like certain passages; Ms. Scott's imagery is often good and the ""mood"" is earthy and dark. However, overall it was disappointing. I just finished it and I could hardly wait to put it down and move onto something more interesting. Ms. Scott desperately tries to make her characters more than cardboard cutouts, but she never manages to succeed. I found myself not caring about the fate of any of these people or the house they lived in (which is really the main ""character"" of the book).The author has mastery of language but the story, like the mounted animals in the book, is merely the pretty arrangement of skin with no guts inside. No life."
positive,"Best one: Maybe I'm not sophisticated or something, but I like Batman Begins so much better than the more critically acclaimed ""The Dark Night."" Dark and exciting, but still fun. Fantastic movie."
negative,"It sucked!: This book was pretty bad. Shame on all of the people who gave it 5 stars and encouraged me to read it. It was boring. There was no character development outside of Bilbo, and I despised his character. It was filled with stupid songs, and had the most unimaginitive monsters I have ever read about in a fantasy novel. This book has turned me off from reading any of Tolkien's other books."
positive,"A must read for San Diegans...: The other reviews sum it up... it's a great book, especially if you live in the area. It's really fun to read about places you've actually been to. Also, it's quite an eye opener to see how badly the natives of California were treated by wave after wave of immigrants."
positive,"Just Great Instead of Excellent: Perhaps it's the thrill of discovery wearing off, or perhaps this album is a half-step below their debut. Nothing horribly new on here - the electronic effects are turned up a tad, and I found there to be fewer catchy songs. There's no real bum track on here (in itself an amazing job) but fewer songs jumped out and grabbed me. ""Special"" (displaying the band's amazing pop sense), ""Push It"" and ""The Trick Is to Keep Breathing"" are the ones I turn the volume up for. I'd slightly suggest the first album over this one, but this one's no slouch - if you want it, get it."
negative,very bad: i've never thought much of Tom Cruise's acting and this film does nothing to change my view.this is a waste of Money&film.a bad joke to the TV SHow.i respect Brian DE Palma but this is a stinker.no story line at all.
positive,"Cheesy deliciousness for VEGANS!!: I love KAL yeast flakes add this to your favorite vegetable dish, favorite snack like organic popcorn or whatever your cheesy heart desires. Yeast flakes is rich, nutritious and delicious. You must have this on you at all times it is great, you're a sprinkle away from deliciousness just click and add to your cart!! You can thank me later :)"
negative,"Disturbed: While this book was well written and created vivid pictures, I was disturbed by the the theme of this story. It was extremely odd and disgusting. After hearing that this book has recieved high ratings, I was very dissapointed with the warped ideas Golding used to express ""human nature"". I do not reccomend this book."
positive,family favorite: My busy family with three kids needs quick meal options. Red Beans and Rice with some veggies and shrimp thrown right in is a great fast meal.
negative,"Just can't get into it, a drag: I loved the earlier Anne movies in childhood and I still do today. Unfortunately this third film is wrecked by the very unimaginative storytelling. The whole thing is full of cliches. It feels like the story was written in desparation in about a night. I literallly cringed when images from the previous two movies were shown as Anne's recollections, i suppose to make us feel sentimental or something. Just one of the unsuccessful aspects of this ""film."" The film itself deserves zero stars. The one star is entirely for the sake of the cast members, who are not to blame for the abysmal results of this film, the ""plot"" is worthless. An utter failure, a waste of money and talent and time. Why bother?"
negative,"Camera controls make life miserable: I like platformers, which is why I got this game. I've played it off and on for a week now, only because I hate not finishing something I start. If it weren't for that fact, I'd never touch this game again. The graphics are good, but the camera controls are [bad]. I've died more than once because the game decided to adjust the camera angle while I was in the middle of crossing some tiny bridge or climbing a narrow ledge."
negative,"OMG this is so awful: how can you people listen to this? this is so awful. i can't stand this... abomination. the pace is so gruelingly slow. i dont mind slow songs every now and then, but jesus, this is slower than slow. these guys give a new meaning to the word slow. it may be a little bit more listenable if they picked up the pace just a little bit. but its so slow, how can they even play that slow, its so mindnumbing, i cant stand it, it drives me insane. its so dark, and its also frightening. i just cannot listen to it. the only reason i checked this horrific disc out is because it got such rave reviews. call me what you will, but i would not recomend this to anybody. i cannot see how anybody could like this. its so awful."
negative,"Absolutely terrible DVD!: This is a terrible DVD. The sound and picture quality are both terrible. The first couple of songs we watched all of showed more or Rod's butt in those gold shiny pants than it did his face. Prancing around and shaking his butt with the two big red veil type scarfs he wore it looked really weird. My wife was laughing her own rearend off it was so funny. I should return it but I will sacrife the money and warn others do not buy this DVD as it is absolutely terrible. We have purchased Rod Stewart ""One Night Only Live at Royal Albert Hall"" and ""It had to be You"" and both of these DVD's I would rate 5 stars for sound and picture. We actually enjoy these two DVD's so much we exercise to them. They are so enjoyable we have 30 minutes of exercise done before we realize it. The actually gives us a bit of incentive to exercise."
negative,way over rated: It really puzzles me how this book could have so many five stars. How a slow book like this could achieve a rating close to Ender's Game is indeed quite incomprehensible. Are there many fans from the 1960s editions rating it?
negative,"The greatest fantasy RIPOFF OF ALL-TIME!: Experience real fantasy and talent and pick up Tolkien, Rowling, Lewis, or even Jordan.Psst! If you want a really good reason why this book needs to be shamed, watch Star Wars: A New Hope and toss in a few Fellowship ripoffs too, and you will see Mr. Paolini's entire plot structure and even devices:Voila! You get Aragorn....er Eragon. The greatest fantasy RIPOFF OF ALL-TIME!But hey, the masses don't know the difference (heck they love it) and Mr. Paolini is laughing all the way to the bank."
positive,"""Ye-aahh,we're going to have to ask you to move your desk.."": I trust you've all read your memos concerning the new TPS cover sheets! Sure to acheive cult status - like ""The Big Lebowski"" - this is a pleasantly funny film whose skewering of all things office-related just seems to get better with each viewing. Too many great bits -you'll be repeating many of them amongst yourselves- to list. Let down only by a rather abrupt and all too pat ending, it's good-natured satire nevertheless projects an underlying bleakness that underscores its relevance.I mean who can't relate to the scene where the sublimely hypnotically indiferent Livingston is promoted to management!"
negative,"New Design: As another reviewer has mentioned, Pampers has changed the design. We also hate the new design, but Amazon has the old design in stock. There's unfortunately no difference at all in the box or product labeling, so I suppose what you get is open to chance."
negative,"THIS MUSIC SUCKS: THE WORST CD I'VE EVER BOUGHT.I BOUGHT THIS CD BASED ON ALL OF THESE RAVING REVIEWS THAT YOU'LL READ BELOW.I TRIED TO DOWNLOAD THE MP3 SAMPLES, BUT PROBLEMS WITH HARDWARE/SOFTWARE/AMAZON/AOL OR ALL OF THE ABOVE KEPT ME FROM FROM SAMPLING THIS PURCHASE.IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING.SOUNDS LIKE MY SONS GARAGE BAND TRYING TO PLAY BUFFETT SONGS."
negative,"I love this movie, but the streaming was unsuccessful.: Had a big problem streaming the video. The video would get stuck every few minutes. We didn't even get to finish watching the movie, which stinks, because I paid $1.99 to watch it. :-("
negative,"Roots of heaven: Beware!I bough the film in blu ray format edited by Twilight Time at a rather hefty price . Unfortunately it does not play. the menu shows up but I cannot activate the start bouton on my all zones LG blu ray player. I own more than 500 blu rays old and new, all playing well,so I do not think its a software update issue, but rather a production defect. Has someone else experienced the same?The Roots of Heaven (1958) [Blu-ray]"
positive,"The HTML book that will stay with you: As a web designer used to using WYSIWYG editors and knowing very little HTML I wanted a book that would teach me how to use it. I was not dissapointed. Although the first vouple of chapters can be a bit congusing, you het into it tight away. Because it is so comprehensive and is designed as a reference book it is also of great value to experienced HTML programmers as well"
positive,"Simple, easy, fun to read, and uses relevant examples: Lafore does a great job of holding your hand while learning C++. This is definitely a book for beginners who are interested in learning C++. Also does not assume you have any prior experience with C (a drawback I found for a lot of books when first getting into C++.) The really great thing about Lafore's style is that he explains the topic, gives a parabolic example, shows you the code, and then goes back and dissects the code line by line explaining what each statement does. Again, this is great for learning C++, even if it is your first language. Don't come here though if you're looking for windows programming. Great Job!"
positive,"an old favorite: I first came across this book in the Portland Public Library in almost the same fashion Nita finds the book that opens the door to her beoming a wizard. I was myself a voracious reader, and the aspect of this book that most affected me was the implication that words themselves have the power to change reality. A thoroughly enjoyable read that I have returned to again and again over the years."
negative,"I would not recommen this book: I can understand that a book written by a person who is not objective can be a bit slanted. This book, however, is terribly inaccurate in its representation of Catholicism. Whatever your reason, If you are trying to get information on the Roman Catholic Church, I suggest you look somewhere else. There are too many inaccuracies and complete ""nontruths"" for this book to be taken seriously."
positive,"Do not 12(b)6 my advice.: If you remotely understood the humor in my header than this book is fine for you. The truth is Civil Procedure is not exactly the stuff that made us want to be lawyers, but when we finish law school, who is going to forget Asahi, or Erie!, or World-Wide Volkswagen, or hmm... Gibbs! Yeazell has all the cases you need in here. I do think Semtek in the Erie section is odd because preclusion has not been introduced. And I think it is the odd placement, if you read the book linearly rather than jumped around, that makes some of the reviewers here hate this book. But this is one of the better books. Couple this sucker with Glannon and presto you will be screaming ""There ain't no subject matter jurisdiction under 1331--it is all a lie!"" In no time. Also, do yourself a favor and remember Kroger v. Owens Electric--it will come to bite you in the you know what if you don't."
negative,"Pass this book up.........its almost as worse as the third.: When I picked up this book, I thought it would be about a new ship that was once again exploring the Genesis planets like in Star Trek III. However, I was MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED.It is yet ANOTHER novel that is not needed for this story. There should have been only 2 books in this storyline. Once Maltz and Carol Marcus were gone (I'm not even going to whine about Saavik not being in this story!), then it should have ended nicely.This novel seems very forced! ""Let's mix in all the characters that were introduced in the earlier books, so we can call it Genesis!"" There is NO EXCITEMENT and NO INTERESTING SUBPLOTS. I skipped through most of the story to only see how Picard's team handled this new adventure.Save your money, folks! Discover the relaunch of Deep Space Nine and Voyager instead!"
positive,"Best Product I have EVER purchased: It takes alot for me to feel the urge to write a review on anything. I have very sensitive skin (so many things irritate it) and I also have dry skin. Recently I was having skin problems with my forehead (tiny little bumps under the skin). Nothing helped - even a prescription from the derm. When I used this peel literally within an hour I noticed a difference in my skin (not kidding). The little bumps seemed to lessen and my dry skin became smooth. I was afraid to use this product every day (bc of my sensitive skin) but so far I have had no problems at all. My skin looks so much better. No longer dry, tiny bumps pretty much gone, and tone looks better.I use it at night though instead of the morning. Kind of makes the skin a tad sticky."
negative,Be careful!: I purchased these brayers in good faith. They are lousy. The rubber rollers are not round and leave gaps in the relief block.I cannot recommend these to anyone at any level of printmaking skills.
negative,What is this teaching?: I don't know why I would present my 3 year old daughter with the idea that you can trash your room when you are angry and that we should use the word HATE towards a baby sister. This book seemingly had very little thought put into the lessons it was teaching. It is also pretty despicable how the adults in the story completely ignore Angelina when the baby comes. I wouldn't want my child to get the idea we might do that to her.
positive,"A MUST HAVE: When I purchased this cd I had already listened to some songs on it and I liked them very much, so I bought the cd thinking that those were going to be the only ones on the cd that were good BUT when I bought the cd I could not belive how good each and every song was on the cd. Now I am one that likes bands like Cradle of Filth, Children of Bodom, Blind Guardian, Dark Tranquility, Iced Earth, Helloween,Iron Maiden, and let me tell you this cd is one of the best Ive heard and if you like good metal with good melody in it then this is most deffinitely a must have in your collection cd!!!!"
positive,"First Pratchett I've read and I'm very impressed.: A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk. Discworld is at once absurd and complex, yet held against the fabric of our reality, it's just as plausible. I'm hard pressed to think of a more likable character than Corporal Carrot. The modest anti-gun message was subtle enough to remain unobtrusive."
negative,"Your gonna buy this game? Ha! Ha! That's a good one!: Oh, your not kidding? Well the makers of this game must have been. It's the worst MK ever. Well if you love 2D action, impossible levels, and no multiplayer, I guess this issss the game for you..."
negative,"Piece of Junk: Worked ok at first then started randomly disconnecting. I have XP and I found out after much troubleshooting that this was the reason my computer kept freezing!!! Complete freeze no ctr+alt+del had to manually turn off my system. Spend the money for a nicer better one. Look at all the bad reviews, DO NOT BUY!!"
positive,good all the way thru: Genuinly creepy and disturbing. Good special effects make the a claustrophobics nightmare. The second one follows suit. Worth your time
positive,"A fun new series.: IRREGARDLESS OF MURDER was surprisingly fun for a mystery, and easy to read quickly. The book has wonderful characters, romance, and a few laughs. And it was fun to visit the Adirondacks again. This book promises a sequel, which will mean a good series has been born. I'm looking forward to reading the next one. I found this book through a ""favorite cozies"" list on Amazon.com, and am I glad I did!"
negative,"ALTITUDE JUST DOESN'T FLY: An intriguing premise crash lands with a tremendous thud. Is ALTITUDE a horror movie? A disaster movie? A sci-fi/Fantasy? All of the above? Possibly, but it's too disjointed to succeed on any of these levels.It becomes tedious with annoying/unlikeable characters trapped in a plane. The CGI is subpar and leading actress Jessica Lowndes (90210) overdoes it pitifully. The cop out ending is the final bomb. A good idea gone awry."
negative,"Not so good.: I couldn't even finish reading this book. I read the back of it and some reviews and got really excited to read it. When I got it though I read about half way through and then quit. It just couldn't keep my attention, I didn't see enough value in it for the size that it was, maybe if it was condensed down to around 60 pages without all the needless stories."
negative,"I will stick with the pink or blue packets...: Found this on sale and excitedly tried it this morning in my coffee and a fresh fruit and yogurt smoothie. I wasn't pleased with results in the smoothie because it didn't seem to dissolve properly, probably because of the cold. This resulted in my smoothie having a ""sandy grit"" texture but the taste was okay. It did dissolve properly in the hot coffee and tasted just fine.Maybe an hour or so later my tummy started gurgling and shortly after was my first of MANY mad dashes to the bathroom today. This started with the smoothie at about 8 AM and has continued throughout the day (it is now 4:15 PM). The info about the product states that it does not cause gastrointestinal distress but other reviews support my experience that it certainly does too AND it continues for long after the product has surely been flushed (pun intended) from your body."
positive,"Absolutely AWESOME!: Usually I write a review only if I dislike something about a book. I rarely bother to write good reviews, because every book gets so many of them. In this case, however, I have to make an exception. For any fan of hard science fiction, ""Pushing Ice"" is AWESOME! It's got everything: realistic characters, solid physics and astronomy, believable near-future society (circa 2050), glimpses of far future society (circa 20,000 A.D.), some REALLY far future, aliens which are somewhat comprehensible, aliens which are completely beyond comprehension, rivalry, broken friendships, betrayal, marooning in space (on multiple levels), struggle for survival, etc. Even asteroid mining and that perennial ""stranded in space"" trick - using electric motors as generators :)"
negative,Known to crash: 6 mo. old drive works good but crashes when warmmed up. Was told they have faulty controllers that are sensitive to heat. Can't take a defragmentation with out crashing soon after in a 60 deg.f room
positive,Banana takes Pawn: From the days when music was music and not of a particular genre. The photo inside says it all: a chess game played with banana slices.
positive,"the view: This is the best film on art I have ever seen. It unfolds in near real-time for the characters and the viewers. Yes it is slow, deliberate, and calculated but it is far from predictable or boring. People who have never experienced the multiple levels of creating art in some form will be treated to the simulated experience of the characters in this film. It isn't exciting in the sense of action but rather like having something dawn on you. I have returned to this film several times over the last 14 years and it never ceases to amaze me. It will touch what creates inside of you. Enjoy the view."
negative,Mengele: The Complete Story: Was hard to stay interested in this book. I found it very boring to read.
positive,"Great Movie: This is a great movie and a visually stunning one -- so it's worth having in a Blu-ray edition. The sexual content is not as shocking as it was when the film was first released, but it's still an emotionally powerful and unnerving work."
positive,"Good Suspenseful Novel: Let me begin by saying this novel is in no way similar to the DaVinci Code as teased on the cover. However, it is a good suspenseful story that made it hard for me to put down. Although fictional, the story is built around a number of true facts. I enjoyed the author's very visual descriptions of locale and scenery. I also liked the characters. However, I did find Ambrosi a little hard to believe that he could have elevated to such a high position in the church, but this is fiction. The writing has me interested in reading other works by this author."
negative,"NOT VERY GOOD.....: I decided to read ""Island"" because i enjoyed ""Brave New World"" so much. Well the former is really horrible compared to the latter. It's pretty boring, the plot doesn't make much sense and the main character's ideas are often all over the place.While certain parts of this story are interesting, in it's entirety, i would have to give it two thumbs down :("
negative,"No Footnotes!: This edition of Freud had NO FOOTNOTES! How can any publisher take pride in itself, when it removes the such an essential element to from the text? This is shameful."
positive,"A Real Sleeper - more people should know about this movie!: I love this movie! I've seen it no less than 10 times and continuously turn my friends on to it. This was my first introduction to the talent of Thandie Newton. She is superb in this movie. I can't say I particularly liked Nicole Kidman's character, but she was quite good also. Noah Taylor was real (are you sure he was acting?). I felt as though I was peeking at a real life situation."
negative,"Old and yellowed: Ordered the EarGels, but they had been exposed to time and heat. They were yellowed and sticky. I threw them away - wasn't worth it to return it. Won't order from here again."
negative,"ACTUALLY NO STARS for rating pf Funny People movie: Save your money. Your time can be MUCH better spent. This was one of the worse movies I ever sat through. Actually, I drifted away close to the end and was thankful I didn't waste that time. Its AWFUL."
positive,"Easy, inexpensive peace of mind.: Takes more time to cut open the box than it does to plug in. Just plug it in, hold the test button, stick your fingers in your ears so you don't do deaf, and your all done. I've used First Alert products for many years, and they just work. They do wear out (5-7 years), but they will alert you when that time comes, usually with a chirping, like other detectors do.Simple, easy to use, no fuss peace of mind unit. Plug it in near air vents in bedrooms or just in open ares for non-living quarters and that's it!"
negative,"Never gets going: This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written."
positive,"Best Steamer Ever: It was a great addition to my set. I was tired of the other hard to clean steamer thing-a-ma-jigs, this cleans up wonderfully."
positive,"Louis Lamour and Tom Selleck: I have every book that Louis L'amour wrote and have startedto collect all those made into movies. This one is especiallygood, with Tom Selleck in the lead role. Great flick"
positive,"A hard book to put down: I've read a lot of Stephen King books from the Dark Tower series to Hearts in Atlantis and this newest work is one of his best. King's mastery of description and imagery make the 620 pages go by with ease. Personally, I didn't think King would wander into the realm of alien abductions and whatnot, but he does a better job than anyone else. I found myself looking over my shoulder more than once while reading this book. However, don't take my word for it...read it and experience it for yourself."
negative,"Not that great...: Our daughter received this set for her birthday. There are several small pieces that are a nightmare to assemble, that really could have come assembled to start with. The cars and trucks drive better on the train tracks than the actual train cars, the cargo boxes do not stay on the train cars very well, the buildings (aside from the one 3-D one) are just thin squares that you just stand up, so they knock over with any movement of the table, in reality, all of the accessories do. I know this is a cheaper set, but I'm sure some of the more expensive ones are of better quality. You really can't even push the train through the tunnel under the waterfall, and my kid is two... So I couldn't imagine other children being able to."
negative,"General Books LLC edition is a bootleg.: This edition, all in italics, is full of typos because it is the result of scanning Bonfire of the Vanities and then reprinting it using OCR (optical character recognition) software. I'm no lawyer, but this seems really sketchy. Regardless of the legality, the typos and italics make it hard to read. Don't buy into this scam."
positive,book review: Shipped promptly! Just what dauther needed and in time for her to read for her English class! I would recommend!
positive,"Great customer support!: I just wanted to say that the parent company, Innovention Toys, was great to deal with. I have version 1.0 and my lasers stopped working. I have no idea why, they just stopped. I contacted them, and they quickly (and without any hassle) sent out a new board and a few extra pieces (as a couple had mis-aligned lasers). So if you buy the game, know that they have great ""hassle-free"" customer support. I didn't know that customer support like that really existed anymore!"
positive,"Great!!!!!READ ME READ ME READ ME!!!: Call me a sucker for classics, well I am. This novel brings forth issues that are still with us today. Yes, the book was written over 100 years ago, but it deals with Single mothers in a two-parent society and how the outsiders to the situation (townspeople) deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter, Pearl. Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings, even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child(ren) and to survive themselves. Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers, but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book. I give it five stars because of it's beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single-parenthood."
negative,"The Day That Sunny Day Died: When I bought this album, I felt like crying. My favorite band, Sunny Day Real Estate, had reformed and I was thrilled. Then when I actually heard the CD, it was just a slap in the face. Sunny Day sounds nothing like they did in ""Diary"" or ""LP2"" anymore. They are more of a rather watered-down alternative rock. ""Every Shining Time You Arrive"" is definetely a great song, but there's no other song on the CD that would make you want to buy it. Let's face it...Sunny Day is dead, but what they did in their first two CDs makes them legendary."
negative,"Long time user with new problem: I have been using Baby Drys (via Amazon Mom) on my now 11 mo old for several months with no problems. There has been either an unannounced product change or a problem with this batch of diapers, as my child developed a severe diaper rash. The doctor confirmed it was a contact rash and the only recent change is this new box of diapers. Unfortunately, we'll be switching brands for at least the time being.Despite this problem, Amazon's customer service was great and promptly issued a refund for this product. I was pleased with the service."
negative,"EZ gig II would not load: EZ GIG II would not load up. Will never buy this brand software again. Very disappointed that you pay for something and expect it to work it doesn't. Tried contacting support, with no success. So this will be a never recommend them to anyone. PRODUCT SUCKED"
negative,"canada green grass: I purchased this on the green grass web site.Their add reads 6 lbs. of grass seed for $29.95 plus a #7.95 shipping fee.I received a 9 lb. package with a $2500 shipping fee. It cintained 49% inert ingredients in addition to the grass seed.So in addition to the extra ingredients that I did not order I only got aboit 4.5 lbs/ of grass seed, not the 6 lbs. that I ordered and the seed mixture is not much different than what is available at your local hardware store. I ordered this on 2/6/2013 and received it yesterday 2/19/2013.I have not planted the seed yet because of our cold upstste weather, but from other reviews that I have read I am not expexting much from th product or the Company selling it. My bad for not reading reviews before purchase."
negative,DUMB!: This movie is a bunch of nonsense. A group of girls (rolls eyes) explores a cave in the U.S.A. (rolls eyes again) with aliens living in it (rolls eyes a third time). DUMB. I can not believe all the good reviews I have read. They must all be from the production staff.
positive,"Pure filth, pure fury!: Of all documentaries i've ever seen about rock n' roll bands this is a must see. It's brilliant, it's perfectly planned and it tells things as they were. It shows the Sex Pistols and their music in a whole different way."
negative,"Glad I didn't pay for it: I had a Fusion handle and blade sent to me by the Gillette company to try. I have to say that I am thankful I didn't pay the premium cost they are asking for this product. It was the most uncomfortable shave I've ever had next to dry-shaving. The idea of the single blade on the reverse side for ""precision"" is only useful because the five blade side is so bulky it can't be manipulated well enough to give a clean line for sideburns or under the nose.Immediately after my shave I had a five o'clock shadow, which was promptly cleaned up by shaving AGAIN with my Mach 3.What's next from Gillette? 20 blades to remove the first layer of skin and gouge out the hair folicle? Perhaps reshape your jaw bone to give you that ""Executive Look"" ?"
negative,"Romantic Snooze: For those of you who found ""The Philadelphia Story"" a witty rom-com about the upper crust will enjoy this film immensely. For those who found it a ponderous bore should avoid ""Holiday"" at all costs. ""Holiday"" is the more excrutiating of the two films with characters even less interesting. Despite their Herculean efforts to breathe life into this inert material neither Cary Grant nor Katharine Hepburn makes you care much about their characters. The fault lies not only with an uninteresting script but also with the lackluster direction of George Cukor, probably the most overrated director this side of Vincente Minnelli. Yawn!!!"
positive,"Amazing...but technology has its drawbacks: I first heard the Belleville Rendez-vous while watching the Academy Awards, and I have hardly stopped listening to this fantastic soundtrack since I got it in the mail yesterday! Jazzy, organic and original it's fun to listen to.But you should note that the CD has some sort of copy control technology on it -- it says in small print ""On some equipment, for example car CD players, playback problems may be encountered"". Well, my Sony stereo -- not entry level, at least according to the money I paid for it! -- doesn't recognize the CD at all, so I can only listen to it using my computer CD player. I'm not quite sure what to do about this glitch, and I'm not willing to part with the soundtrack, but this aspect of the CD sure is annoying."
positive,"One of Hal Hartley's best: Along with Simple Men and Surviving Desire, the Unbelievable Truth is one of Hartley's best films. Firmly entrenched in the 80s when it was made, this lightweight comic romance has a lead character of the wonderful Adrienne Shelley (RIP) as a young woman who negotiates college versus work deals with her parents while believing the world is going to end via nuclear disaster at any moment. Into this comes the hero, Robert Burke in his gorgeous youth, as a newly released prisoner coming back to his hometown. The script is brainy banter and just walks the fine line between stage and actual people, which is one of Hartley's best talents. The earlier films like this one (pre Amateur, for instance) still have a light touch with the dark edge instead of the dark edge with blacker humor like the later films: for fun, romantic, cynical college-educated Hal Hartley, watch this."
positive,"Creepy classic: A favorite of author Gore Vidal (see his book, ""Screening History"" for details), ""The Mummy"" remains one of the most imaginatively creepy classics from the golden age of horror. Karloff is superb in what is perhaps his best role, and Zita Johann is more than beautiful enough to justify Im-Ho-Tep's centuries long obsession with her. The makeup by the great Jack Pierce has never been equalled, and the atmosphere is simply chilling. Far superior to any sequels or remakes."
positive,"My dog goes insane for these!: I used to be able to buy these at Petco, since they stopped carrying them I have to buy online. These are my dog's absolute favorite treats. I've tried to find something similar, but nothing else makes him as happy as Sniffers. I usually buy three bags at a time, hope they never discontinue this product!"
positive,"""I Must Take the A Train"": Don't you love the butterfly at the beginning. This is the best movie I've ever seen. As a child I loved it & now as a grown up even more. I encouraged my boyfriend to watch it, but he thought I was crazy until he read all the wonderful reviews. This movie stays near and dear to your heart. For all those who belive in magic, fantasy,love and adventure, get this movie. Parents & kids both will enjoy."
positive,Nice: Very well put together kit and it has everything you need. Great gift for someone who just bought their first car.
positive,"Genius: If there was any question of whether Nietzsche was an absolute genius, these two books will prove it. His wit, enthusiasm, courage, and extreme energy will keep you enthralled in his arguments. These are the two works by Nietzsche that give him his reputation as an extremist and genius."
positive,"Advaita seminar: '`Living from Neutrality' by Justus Kramer Schippers is not an introduction to Advaita but, rather, is an excellent seminar in that philosophy. Neither sweet nor patronizing, Schippers is a plain-spoken adult who expects his reader to be an adult, as well. I enjoyed Schippers' insights and expect to read this book several more times in the forthcoming years."
positive,AWESOME!: Perfect Book!Greatest Tips Tricks and Tweakings for all growers.Definitely Highly Recommend The Cannabis Grow Bible!
negative,"Trite; just capitalizing on ""Saving Private Ryan"": For gripping stories of WWII, read ""D-Day,"" by Stephen Ambrose. These ""up close and personal"" stories grew monotonous. Most significantly, Brokaw gave short shrift to the sins of this ""greatest"" of generations. While I appreciated the discussion of our nation's treatment of Japanese-Americans during the war, full treatment of this generation's rampant racism, sexism and post-WWII national arrogance was missing."
positive,awesome!: great blast from the past! item was just as described and works perfectly! i will buy from this seller again
positive,"Here is a reality check&#65533;. It&#65533;s only a movie.: Judging by some of the really ridiculous reviews written on this board, I could honestly say that they are good deal of people who should be put into mental intuitions. It's a Fantasy movie for heaven sake; nothing in the film is surpose to be real. Only an extremely uptight people would find any fault in this film. It's a popcorn movie, nothing more, nothing less, and if you want reality in a movie like this then you have serious mental problems. Take it for what it is and enjoy. It's really a great movie once you can get pass your ego, and take it for what it truly was made to be. FUN."
negative,"Handles break with ease: The notch where you insert the handle will break fairly quickly. I was using this product to store wires and other small electrical tools, weighing in no more than 6 pounds. After a week of use, (and only picking up the box twice), I heard a crack and saw that a piece of the rim broke off, and now the handle does not stay in place. I can only imagine what happens when you fill up this organizer with paper, which is much more heavier and denser..."
negative,dont buy: My goodness this book droned on and on about belonging and longing without any real wisdom coming through. I will never buy a book again because someone else said it was good I lost money on this one.
negative,"Problem With Noise Cancellation Feature: The only reason for my purchase of the Sennheiser PXC 300 Noise Cancelling Headphones was to cancel noise not listen to music, etc. The person that I purchased them for is writing a technical book and relative silence is an important part of the writing process. Unfortunately, the normal surrounding noise was not canceled and, therefore, it was necessary to return the headphones. Please note, the other features of the headphones appeared to be fine. As of 15 August I have not heard anything about a refund, but am confident that will be properly handled by Amazon. I have made several purchases from Amazon and until this one have always been very satisfied with them. I look forward to a continuing relationship."
negative,"umm, try something else: keith plays like a pig here- he practically wastes peacock and dejohnette, they are allowed nothing else than the opportunity to accompany jarrett's yowling and over-indulgent right-hand lines. for some serious piano trio playing, check out mccoy tyner's early albums for impulse, bill evans' live at montreux, chick corea's now he sings, now he sobs, anything by paul bley with gary peacock, or keith's own first albums with charlie haden and paul motian"
negative,The worst blade I have bought in 40 years: I thought I would try a new razor and saw the fushion. I am totally disappointed and actually threw out the razor and refills before I used them all. I have never cut my face so much with a razor and by five shaves the blade was done. This is the worst system gillette has ever released - my mach three is far superior. I tried the Schick hydo 5 and it is a pleasure and leaps and bounds better.
negative,"Disappointed.: I was really excited about this product since it had so many wonderful reviews, especially coming from people with pale skin like mine. The product didn't live up to my expectations at all. I turned orange the first night, but I continued to try it out for at least a week to be able to give an accurate review. I just became more and more orange, it streaked everywhere, and overall looked extremely fake. I'm really disappointed because I thought this would finally be the best tanning product out there for people with light/pale skin, but once again it just didn't work. I think this would work well for others who have a base tan already."
positive,"Giving Something Back: Giving Something Back is such an awesome cd. You really start to make a personal connection to the band with this record. They weren't as powerful live back then as they are now, but it's still a great cd. You really start to see their personalities shine through, like frontman Jimi Haha's humor. It's also the only cd where you can get the song ""React"", which is wonderful, and ""Vacuum"". If you like Pushing the Salmanilla Envelope, then you will love this. All of your favorites off of that album are alive and kicking on this one."
positive,Mr Coffee 4 cup coffeemaker: The Mr Coffee - 4 cup coffeemaker arrived as promised...packaged well. It is just right for one person and fits nicely on the kitchen counter. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a couple of mugs of coffee...it brews quickly and stays hot.
negative,"a big disappointment: After all I had heard and read about Golding's Lord of the Flies I was expecting a novel story, not a Rbinson Crusoe cliche, or at least some good writing/language, but what I got was a story that could have been conjured up by my 11 year old kid: lots of repetition (the conch, the glasses, the beast, the fire)and not what one could term an erudite piece of writing. How this book gets onto college lists is beyond me. Are we actually meant to interpret/understand the vague imagery, if that's what it is? Boring. Unfortuantely this is my first Golding book, and I'm afraid it will be my last... for some time at least."
negative,"Good story- Poor writing: Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books."
positive,"I found it very versital.: I was looking to hook my computer up in our kitchen/dinning room and wanted the option of watching TV when not on the computer. This monitor works perfect. We do not have it hooked up to a HD broadcast, so it looks better from about 4 feet away than right up next to it. But either way it still looks good. I love surfing the internet and watching the basketball game in the PIP. We don't haver it hooked up to a stereo and use the TV speakers and it sounds GREAT! It has a lot of set up options to get the picture looking its best. And the remote has gread functions and is easy to use.The monitor, itself, looks great. We always get great compliments from our friends!"
negative,"Sucks!!!: One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The cinematography is good, acting is decent, which actually takes away from the movie. The plot is extremley boring and the only out you look for in terms of comedy is hoping to get some unintential comedy, but the film doesnt even grant you that. A misleading title at best, and I'm not sure what exactly was unrated about the version I saw, but this is a BAD movie. I enjoyed N Dynomite, Road Trip, and such, but this isnt even close. I'm not sure how this can even be described as a comedy."
negative,"These boots are much darker than the picture: Length:: 0:05 MinsI researched all types of hiking boots on the web, and these are the best. Good durability, comfort etc. I finally ordered the boots and waited. Finally the boots arrived, and yes they were very comfortable and arrived in good condition. Unfortunately the Dark Chocolate color is so dark that it is almost black. I am sure this will grow on me, but the picture on the web site is inaccurate and gave a false expectation. The picture is just a little darker than the CHOCOLATE color, but the reality is different. Actually the color is nice and it will hide the dirt, just not what I expected."
positive,"A New Favorite: I have owned Warrior of the Heart for many years and hoped the artist had more CD's. I told myself not to expect to much but when I recieved and listened to this I was so pleased! Like Warrior of the Heart, each track is superb. I'm so happy to have taken a chance on this, fantastic!"
negative,"Do you like antique equipment?: I teach a college course in computer hardware and used Mr. Meyers' book. There were a few minor technical errors, but noting major. What I had a problem with was the intensity with which he covered older technology and operating systems, and then glazed over material that my students would see later on the exams. I have subsequently moved over to a different book."
negative,be careful: they don't tell you different heights need different sizes.... til you have to pay over half the price to return it! BE CAREFUL... they aren't... very disappointing!
positive,"AMAZING!!! So Easy.: I had this item on my amazon wish list for a couple years and finally decided to just buy it for myself. After just one use, I'm kicking myself for not buying it sooner. It is so easy to use and my hair looks like I just went to the salon. Seriously, I used the Infiniti for about 3-4 minutes on my damp hair and it looks SO GOOD I can't believe it. It was so easy, it was just like brushing my hair and the shine and body are only matched by a salon visit. I have thick, short hair cut in a shag bob. Try it...you won't be dissapointed. Wow!"
negative,"You get what you pay for: I bought this earlier this year, thinking I am getting an upgrade from my Sansa M250.Wish I was not soo quick to throw out my old player.Its really fustrating when it syncs with the computer after disconnecting it takes hours ( by then the battery is drained) to power off from the connected mode.I hate thisproduct. Get the real deal save yourself some fustration and money. Not worth it.Beware!"
negative,"Too many little flaws add up: I was really excited to register for this - and really disappointed when I got it. Biggest problem I had was that the moving fish part was broken. I could only get music and lights. But even if that was working, the music itself is wierd and annoying sounding - and really loud. I can't imagine how they think this would put anyone to sleep. The nature sounds setting was ok. Worst part was the button for baby to manipulate. The lever and the spin dial that work the fish were hard for me to use, I can't imagine a baby having the strength and dexterity to work this. And the large button in the middle which allows baby to turn it on themselves was so touchy that they would just start the same song over and over again. Since it has a motor and moving parts, it eats 4 huge D batteries. I can almost see using this as a toy, but not a soothing crib item."
negative,"Cheaply made product: I often struggle when trying to empty the clippings from my lawnmower into a garbage bag and I had hoped that this product would make that task easier. I was disappointed, I must say. The frame is very thin and unstable. The assembly instructions were hard to understand and the product was hard to assemble with only one set of hands. I am not pleased with this product at all. It seems as though it would collapse if I were to use it for my intended purpose. I do not recommend this product at all."
negative,"YOU CALL THIS ORE???!!!???: I had high expectations for this product, as overall, I have been very satisfied with the variety of products I've purchased on Amazon in the past. Thus my disapointment with this one.First off, my kids say it has a ""chalky"" aftertaste (whatever that means - kids!!!). Add to that, it really doesn't appear to soothe ANYTHING on a baby as far as I can tell, and most frustratingly, well, all I can say is that compared to other animal feeds, this produces the toughest veal that I have ever eaten, bar none, when it's not fighting your fork.And I've noticd anothere curous thing, wen I am hloding the jar rel close toom my hed it mars me a little bi woozy buthet ljpopoo ';oo81.dbsio k"
positive,"Awesome EJB Book: This is the BEST Java certification book I've bought! I'm used to studying Java certification books that need a GAZILLION LINES of text just to explain one small topic! But with this book all you have to do is look at the pictures and read a few lines of text... and bingo you get it.Trust me, I passed the SCBCD exam with a score of 97% because of this book!"
positive,"Britfest!: Great movies, Lots of fun and entertainment with this DVD. It was at our door right after I ordered it. Delivered in very good packaging not a scratch on it. How nice to have so many movies in just two discs. Years of enjoyment ahead with this purchase. I recommend this collection, highly.Indy Jan"
negative,"Awful, one of the worst books existing: I tried reading this book first when I was five, with my mom, then when I was twelve. It was horrible each time. I remember distictly suffering through it up to the part where Meg makes jam, then deciding it wasn't worth my time. My mom hated it each time she read it too.The movie, however, with Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon, is very good. If you want to know the story and not suffer, see the movie, which is quite good."
positive,"The Special Edition has arrived - BUY IT NOW!: This review refers to the new Special Edition DVD that has just been released.Both widescreen and full screen versions are included, but more importantly, the original Australian dialogue has finally been restored. The difference between that and the clunky, awkward American-dubbed audio most of us are familiar with is like night and day (and if you want to find out for yourself, both are included on the disc, so feel free to compare).Rounding out the package is a making-of featurette, several trailers, and a ""pop-up video"" style subtitles-option which presents various minutea about the film and its locations while you watch."
positive,"hooray for the 60s: Hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid until now...seeing it again as an adult, I still loved the musical numbers and the colorful clash of 60s jaded realism with counterculture's fanaticism with mysticism. The--ahem--imaginative impressions of period Regency costume look almost laughably colorful and polyester compared to the more historically accurate period films that have come out in recent years, but overall, I still enjoy this movie. The DVD unfortunately has no special features, but it's hard to complain when a practically forgotten musical finally gets re-released."
negative,"This Book Will Waste Your Time: The plot for this book - an old man improbably bumping into strange circumstances - is so thin and tiring that I suspect it was birthed by a four o' clock a.m. game of slug charades. You should only read this book to:- stop you from looking at sleeping, drooling people- remind yourself that there are worse things than being trapped with your own thoughts- trick someone you hate into reading it (convince them to wait until the end)The book has: boring dialogue, tired ideas, meaningless randomness. And it lacks any sort of entertainment value. It would be a real pity if the author's other books are any good, because I'll be avoiding them as if they are socially stupid relatives."
positive,"He proves who the true winner is!: Clay Aikens debut cd is beyond outstanding. Each and every song you can feel him sing, as if he was singing to you. He is 100% talented even more so then i a true clay fan even though. The songs Perfect day and Measure of a Man combine true vocal talent and true writing talent to make perfection. There is not a single song on the cd that is skip worthy. It is amazing and Clay truly proved even though he might not be made for stardom he is talented and i would listen to him sing the alphabet because he is amazing!"
positive,Great Music: Wonderful music for relaxation and dining. Mary Beth Carlson brings the piano into the home.
positive,"One of the best albums I own: These guys are really really freaking good, and even better in concert. Normally, with a lot of CD's, if you listen to the whole thing a couple of times, you pick out songs you like more than others, and are able to narrow down your playlist to the ""better"" tracks on the album. Not so with The Matches. After roughly 9 months worth of listening, I am still hard-pressed to pick out a ""best"" song on it, because they're all really good. This would have to be one of the best punk CD's I own. Download the free mp3's on their website, and listen to them. If you like the samples, then you'll love this CD too."
positive,"Yes, a Roman Emperor DID fight in the Colosseum.: Just to set the record straight, since more than a couple of people here have claimed otherwise---A Roman Emperor (I believe it was either Caligula or Nero) did fight at least once in the Colossuem. Check the history books. I'm sure it was staged so that the Emperor was ensured of survival....But hey, it happened."
negative,"WARNING! NOT for HV20: Amazon now (4/26/07) has this linked with the Canon HV20 Camcorder, both as a ""buy these togather"" and listing this in the accessories section under the HV20.Everything I see, including Canon web site and email from Canon support, is that this is incorrect. The HV20 needs the BP-2L14 not a BP-214. ( The longterm solution is for Canon to be more sensible with their part numbers. ) But for now I suggest anyone research this before going for Amazon's suggestion for this for an HV20."
positive,"Good book for pet owners, but not breeders: If you're getting a lovebird or 2 for a pet this is a great book. It goes over feeding, health, and all the other things a bird would need. It doesnt talk about breeding though. It goes over the different species which is nice.. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it didn't talk about breeding. But as a pet book, it should be 5 starts :)"
negative,"Halloween III: This movie absolutely sucks, it has nothing to do with Halloween or Halloween II. They wasted their time on this one. What the hell are they thinking not involving Michael Meyers or at least his mask. Duh!"
positive,"Very Uplifting and Fun: I really enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun. Diane Lane is wonderful in this movie. Sandra Oh is great as her friend dealing with motherhood. Watching the scenes of Italian countryside is wonderful. Watching Diane Lanes character as she gets over her divorce, and moves to a foreign country by herself is inspiring."
positive,Great Deal: My husband has been looking for this set of DVD's for a long time and was very happy that we found them.
negative,"Short life and poor quality control: Purchased 2 Lenmar DLP007 batteries to be used with Panasonic TZ3 digital camera.One battery was dead after 1 charge cycle. Lenmar did replaced that.Then during the past year, I continued to use Panasonic original battery and the 2 Lenmar batteries on regular rotation. Now, Panasonic battery still allows me to take 100+ photos easily. One Lenmar battery is now completely dead (cannot be recharged). The 2nd Lenmar battery holds only a fraction of the charge, maybe good for 30 photos.So you might be able to get 6 months to 1 year worth of useful life out of the batteries, and then they do not hold the charge any more. These batteries are around half the price of Panasonic original batteries, but the useful life is not half of Panasonic battery."
negative,dvd: This dvd has close captioning which cannot be taken off which is distracting to the kids. It would appear that this isn't an original copy.
positive,"'E's done it again.: Another unbelievably brilliant album from techno's self-professed Little Idiot. Much is being made about Moby's sampling of old-time R&B and folk recordings on this record; sure, they're fantastic pieces of work (and for me personally the most fulfilling-- ""Run On"" is just SO damn catchy), but if you're some kind of bizarre techno-purist then you've got plenty to go on with PLAY, from the fast-paced cascade of ""Machete"" to the sprawling electro-rock brothers-gonna-work-it-out fable ""South Side"". I sound like some kind of propaganda machine, but heck, maybe I am; God knows this album deserves promoting. Listen and buy."
positive,"Just Perfect, Not too long: I read one of the other viewers response about the video being too short. I totally disagree with that viewer. I believe that the video is the perfect length, you get a good workout in with a lot of variety in a fair amount of time. I have done a lot of videos that seem to go on forever and you wonder if they will ever end, and worse than that when you are finished you don't feel like you have accomplished anything. Kick to Get Fit is different, you get a great workout that works all areas of the body, and when you're done with this video you know you have done a workout. Oh, a little tip to anyone buying this video, DO THE COOL DOWN AND MASSAGE PART AT THE END, IT REALLY MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT!"
negative,"Horrible: It isn't very often that I turn off a movie and walk away before it has ended but this movie was deserving of such behavior. Damn you Michael Bay for killing my childhood memories about Transformers. I believed that you were sincere when apologizing for the previous embarrassment that netted you a lot of money and wanted to believe that this movie would be better. No, it wasn't. Where is your pride? Better yet, where is your soul. Wait, I can see it circling the drain ready to disappear forever. I will never watch any of your movies again and hope the same for others. you. sick. bastard."
positive,"The Canterbury Tales: Illustrated Prologue: This is a great edition of the prologue, the illustrations really accent the story very well."
negative,"Stupidest movie ever seen: Watched about twenty or thirty minutes and a total waste of time. Females will be disgusted by the constant violence against women. I suppose some of the men on here who commented found it very satisfying, which says more about them than the movie. Don't waste valuable time watching this garbage."
negative,"Dreadful...: Clan of the Cave Bear was required reading my sophomore year in high school. I read it 20+ times, it was so wonderful. I read 2-4 a fair number of times, and anxiously awaited #5. When it was finally released, after 10 years of waiting, I bought an autographed hardcover copy. 2 days later I was kicking myself for wasting the money. What an awful follow up to what was such a promising story. This book was dreadful, trite, boring, and it took a supreme effort for me to even finish it the first time. Needless to say, that expensive hardback copy wound up in the Goodwill pile. I'm never going to read it again."
positive,"A teacher's story: Our elementary school gives a copy of this book to each teacher leaving at the end of a school year, whether transferring or retiring. It is a wonderful book that becomes a treasured memory of their years with us. I was pleased to see how quick and easy it was to order through Amazon.com AND they had plenty of books on hand!"
positive,"High class, well made, cinematic masterpiece!: I could go on and on about the various aspects of quality in this film...I will leave that for other reviewer's of this film. I would just like to add it is a beautiful masterpiece, complete in every way. An experience of old cold war Czechoslovakian lovers...there is tension, sadness, love scenes of high taste and quality throughout the film. Even a special few minutes when every woman watching the sequence on screen, would probably be a lesbian for the day. Its not about sex...its all about living a full life and loving someone deeply...buy this film and sit back and enjoy it...bring a handkerchief along for the ending."
positive,"wow: I had read this book when i was only 13, although the content was a LITTLE too mature for me. I still loved it, I hadven't missed a year of not reading it at least once. ""Lion.."" has introduced me to the worlds Llywelyn paints and i have remained faithful to her since i was a kid. Ive read every book she has ever published (Good and bad ;) ). Ive recommended this book to everyone. Anyone, not only interested in Celtic or Irish history, but history in general would greatly appreciate this book. The people who gave it anything less than ""five stars"" must either dislike the Irish or have something against a good book!"
negative,"Where the hey does one find a flat bottomed mug?: I ordered two of this item, so certain was I that this would do the trick for my coffee staying hot. It makes complete sense to me that it needs a flat bottomed mug in order to work efficiently and I never gave a thought when ordering that a flat bottomed mug would be so elusive!I have looked high and low. If anyone reading this review knows where I can locate such an animal, please let me know before I send this purchase back. Without the aforementioned flat bottomed mug, the product does a very poor job - so poor as to be useless!"
negative,Not too impressed...: This item rattles like crazy in my jeep now. I've only had it for 6 months and I have not abused it at all. The item is obnoxious. I'm thinking about taking it out of my jeep. Reception is not great and I have a fire stick 4 foot on my jeep. Too bad...
positive,"Alex Sydorenko: Long Live John Carter Warlord of MArs. When I was a kid and read this series, I wanted to be John Carter of Mars. Now I'm much older and still fascinated while rereading A Princess of MArs. Who can forget the opening part with John Carter lying in that Arizona cave and gazing at the strange red planet Mars while something behind him in the cave's darkness is stirring. What was that force that sent Carter to the red planet? And then there's his arrival in Mars and that strange green many-armed creature Tars Tarkas of the mighty green men of Thark. And then there's Dejah Thoris, the princess, a woman that words can't even begin to describe. What a babe. This book is still as good as it was back then. --Alex Sydorenko, Chicago, Sept 1999."
negative,"worst. movie. ever.: I normally don't write movie reviews because movies are very subjective but in this case, I'll make an exception. I had the misfortune of watching this movie, as I'm a fan of ""dumb comedies"" but this one fails. On every level. Do not waste your time with this one...TRUST ME ON THIS. It is so bad; I don't even know where to begin.Skip it."
positive,"Deep Meditation: I am really enjoying my Anugama Healing music cd, is very conducive to enter into an altered state of consciousness for meditation, healing and dreaming, or all together. Is a welcome addition to my collection of healing music, which I use in my Reiki practice. My clients really like it and seem to be able to relax deeply. Very happy with this product."
positive,"You gotta love garbage: After missing theirr recent Toronto concert at the phoenix (sold out in 20 minutes!), and reading reviews, I had to buy this CD. So I did... I liked the first album but I LOVE version 2.0. Everything from the clever Album title to the amazing mix of wonderful songs made me fall in love with garbage for real!!!If you're at all unsure about garbage, just buy this CD and see what happens.... But don't forget to get your concert tickets as soon as they go on sale!"
negative,"Accurate But Boring: This is probably the most accurate version of ""A Tale Of Two Cities"" but, it's the worst version to own or watch. Sticking strickly to the plot of the story and historical facts this movie has no spark or passion. It's an easy out though for the teens to lazy to read the book for English.The movie is extremely long which is part of the problem and the acting is horribly done.I found myself straining to stay awake. The script is something out of the Middle Ages with no modern word adaptations it's hard to imagine any of the characters are ""real."" The storyline is straight out the book with no hollywood adaptations this causing part of the problem-- you don't get any sparks between Lucy and Carton- or dialouge. It focuses more on the war and hardly anything on the romance or passion in the story.All in all this movie in my opinon butchered one of the classic love stories in literature. Tale of Two Cities fans- we know buy the classic it's always better!"
negative,"Pure Rated Garbage.(PRG): THIS IS NOT A GREAT ALBUM. RAY-J LACKED A WHOLE LOT. MY SISTER WASTED HER MONEY, WE ALL DON'T LIKE IT, FIRST ALBUM IS MUCH BETTER. SECOND, I DON'T KNOW. ""WAIT A MINUTE"" WAS HOT. I WOULDN'T TAKE THE LAST COPY OFF THE SHELF. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO AN R & B FAN. THE ONLY SONG ON THERE IS HOT ARE "" WHAT I NEED"" ""BLUE HIGH HEELS"" AND ""ONE WISH""."
positive,"Great Cheap Condoms: I was bit surprised when it came in USPS loose package. Though, I've been using it since then and greatly satisfied with this product."
negative,"It is a NO Star...: People...Please do not waste your money on this garbage. It is out of date, inaccurate and either too simplistic or too hard to understand (I am a physician's assistant). I'm not sure why Webster is letting the DREADED DELMAR get hold of their titles to ruin them like they are doing. This is the second piece of crap they've made out of something nice."
positive,Best of Travel: San Francisco Seattle Vancouver: The video quality is outstanding. Watching this video gives the viewer a glimpse of 3 very interesting cities as seen by Rudy Maxa. The video definitely entices the viewer to want to visit these cities. It is a great travel video.
negative,Boring to Read: Everytime I think of this book I feel to yawn. I was excited to get it but I have to admit I was very bored reading it. The secret of Mr. Hogan's swing was no secret at all. It may have been back then but not now. My apologies to the author. It is just my opinion.
negative,"Don't read this book while operating heavy machinery.: Holy god, don't buy this book. It is intensely bad and over-appreciated. 1000 words cannot even begin to do justice to the extent of this book's worthlessness.Clearly, 18th Century vernacular is a hurdle in any book, but I doubt Garrison Keillor could rework this story into something bearable. The story is an exercise in description and banality. There is virtually no inertia or direction to the plot, and characterization is hopelessly shallow.Seriously, don't get this book. I'm warning you. I love great literature, and I hate this book. Ok...""hate"" is a little rough, but I really, really don't like it. Try something more enjoyable; like stapling your hand to your eyelid.Ok, just so I have not wasted all your time, read anything by Wilde or Kafka instead. Read some freaking Mark Twain, for goodness sake. Just lay off the Goldsmith."
negative,"What a terrible dvd of such a great movie!: I adore this movie. the animation is wonderful, the story poignant, but the dvd was terrible! They obviously hadn't touched up the old VHS at all. The picture has lots of holes and spots. I like the fullscreen format personally, but I know many people would have liked the option of widescreen. If their are bonus features like the box claims I can't find them. Overall, you will probably be better off with the VHS, which had a better picture."
negative,Gladiator BD: Has anyone noticed the audio is only DTSnot DTS HD MA as one was led to believe.This blu ray audio is worse than both theoriginal 5.1 and the subsequent 6.1 from thelater release.
positive,"IMPRESSIVE LITTLE MACHINE: I liked this machine so much, I bought a second. It never skips and plays everything that is shoved into it. The battery goes a little more than 3 hours, the internal speakers with the little ear piece sound wonderful, the external speakers sound great (though I have always been no more that 3 ft way and have never had the sound on full volume). The slender size you can't beat. You can do everything ""manually"" on the machine that you can do with the remote. I'm very careful with both machines, so I'm not sure how it would hold up in a rough enviornment i.e. kids, . I would have never considered a Audiovox, but I checked out MANY machines and read every review. I'm happy with my purchases."
positive,great bike rack: I am using this bike rack at least once per week and I have really gained confidence with this bike rack. This is a great product. Set-up is fairly easy. The bikes feel very secure. Sometimes the straps are slightly difficult to unhook but at least I know that it will be difficult for the bikes to come off. The bikes have minimal movement while driving - at first I was concerned as I haven't traveled with bikes before but have since grown comfortable. As long as the straps are tightly fastened there is no need to be worried. I use elastic straps to keep the tires and pedals from moving and to prevent damage to the other bicycle. Truly a great bike rack... solidly manufactured and a lifetime warranty to back it up.
negative,Classic DVD: I am 100% disappointed with this Classics DVD set. I am especially disappointed with the 'The Year Without a Santa Claus' version. I was led to believe ALL the shows were the Rankin Bass Classics by the wording and pictures on the DVD cover.
positive,"""Switching Goals"" is OK...: It's a great movie but not as good as the others. It has some action and, being a soccer fan, the soccer games and practices were cool. It was OK and that's why it needed 4 stars- it just wasn't as good as the others."
negative,"RUBBISH: Rubbish rappty musc for old men, seriously I hate these guys, little sister is an overated and crappy song, you people dont really like it do you? And No one kniws sucks as well"
negative,"Speechless doesn't cut it: This is one of the worst recordings i have ever had the displeasure of listening to.The music is grating and conflicts badly with the artists vocals.If you must have annoying,80's influenced contempory pop/rock,then sample something by Eric Champion or Michael W. Smith.If you want somthing for it's acoustic edge,look into artists such as Eli or Jenifer Knap."
negative,Junk: A piece of junk.The first one was DOA and was replaced.The replacement worked but got so hot I was afraid to use it and it may have damaged my battery.The cost of a new battery and a good charger is more than the cost of a new drill.I have bought my last piece of Black & Decker.
positive,"FUNKY JIMMY: IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE FUNKY SIDE OF JIMMY REED, HERE IT IS!JIMMY REED JR. ON THE BASS GUITAR ADDS THE FUNKY TOUCH WITH THE ADDITIONS OF SOME WAH WAH PEDALS ON THE OTHER GUITARS ALSO! ITS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN HIS OTHER MUSIC, BUT ITS IS STILL A GREAT CD!"
positive,Perfect for my pickup.: I have a S10 pickup with a topper and my options for a bike rack were limited. This is perfect. It's a little labor intensive to put on and take off but it works... it works well... and I'm very happy with it.
positive,"Howllllllll: My grandaughter needed this book for school. Instead of trying to find one in the book stores, I had her download it on her Kindle. Fast, easy and it made me look good to my grandaughter. The purchase was a bargain at $0.99. She reviewed the book, got an A on the assignment and all is well in Houston.....Buy a Kindle...download book assignments and be a hero to your family.m"
positive,"Best book on the Bible I own!: I have had my copy of this book for several years not and have found it to be instructive and inspiring, comforting and challenging. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to learn more about Scripture, regardless of religious affiliation or educational level."
positive,"Great sci-fi double feature: The clarity of both pictures where very good.One could see everything very clearly and of course I enjoyed both of them.Brought back ""old times"" for me.Anyone that is collecting ""old sci-fi"" movies on dvd will I am sure enjoy these two."
positive,"Best Anime Ever.: This easily qualifies for the ""Best Anime Award"" for the romantic Anime scene.Buy it and the soundtrack. You won't be disappointed.."
positive,"One of my all time favorites.: Moonstruck is an enchanted love story. From la luna to tiamo it makes me smile and laugh. From a gorgeous Cher to a hot ""new guy"" a very young Nicolas Cage. I saw this movie in the theater and revisit it when I want to be transported by a romantic charming classic. I loved the instant access and format provided by Amazon. Get comfortable and enjoy!"
positive,"Not a good indication of the rest of the series: RECOMMENDED: I 1st read this book when I was 23, so this is from that perspective...I haven't read a lot of fantasy, just Harry Potter.The beginning is great, very engrossing. I was instantly hooked. It's a fun, great story. I love all of the different types of creatures and lots of surprises. The details in the story are not in the least bit predictable.Good book for kids, and adults will find in a necessary prequel to ""Lord of the Rings"""
negative,"it was just okay: we bought this nursery tent to take to the beach with us to protect our 9 month old son from the sun. we liked the mesh netting which allowed air to flow through the tent. however, one day was pretty windy and the anchors provided are not sturdy enough to secure it. the wind toppled it over with our son lying inside. it didn't blow away or very far since we were sitting right next to it, but it still toppled over. i wouldn't recommend it for a trip to the beach!"
positive,Soccer Drills Thouroughly Organized! Quality Explanations As Well!: These four programs were part of the 6 set I bought.All have valuable soccer tips that will give coaches achance to make practices exciting.
negative,"Badly done!: The end of the story between Jane Austen & her ""beau"" made me teary eyed, but after that, the blatant sexuality in the movie kind of ruined it for me. The movie took away from the wit, subtlety & the sensuality that Jane Austen had, I'm sure, to this Hollywood-ized version of it. Almost as if in order to keep us entertained, they had to include the nudity & violence. Others may have a differing opinion, but to me it wasn't what I expected & it honestly just didn't fit."
negative,"To call this widescreen is fraud: I just bought this widescreen edition and feel totally ripped off!!! I own the standard format edition, and because I love this movie so much, it was worth buying again in the widescreen format. This ""widescreen"" edition is nothing more than the standard format edition with the top and bottom chopped off! This is one time you are actually better off with the standard format edition. I watched both editions side by side, and the widescreen edition was not much wider, and missing the top and bottom of the picture! There was actually more to see in the standard format edition."
positive,"A beautiful book: A beautiful book for everyone, but especially if you are experiencing suffering right now. For you, this book is a retreat."
negative,"No greek at all: Everybody knows Robertson's Word Pictures to be an excellent reference for Bible study.But I was deceived by this edition of his work: no greek, no grammar explained. It is an abridged version !Maybe I made an error in choosing this edition, but don't make the same, and buy the original version !"
negative,"Not worth the effort: This is the third calculus book I've had, and the only one I haven't understood. In the others I could always follow their examples and relate them to the homework questions. In this book the example problems have nothing to do with the homework questions. I imagine if one had a good calculus teacher this would be less of a problem.Basically this book taught me nothing more than to hate calculus."
negative,"I'm left feeling sour...: I thoroughly enjoyed the book! It was quick paced and gripping. The problem was when I put it down... I felt sour -- like I'd been cooped up on a mountain with a bunch of bumbling idiots for three weeks... That was what stuck with me... Could that have been the whole point of the book??? To convey that??? Wasn't there something more important to convey? Like Kocour's experience with the mountain, or more importantly, with herself? I wonder if she feels sour, still..."
positive,"Best introduction to its subject that I know of: When one is trying to get a basic overall grasp of Greek mythology, it can be an overwhelming and formidable subject, and one can be at a loss for the best place to start. Most books I've found either give too much detail too fast or else are hit-and-miss selections that don't give a very comprehensive introduction. If that's been your experience too, this book could be an excellent solution to your problem. It gives a highly readable thorough introduction without overwhelming you with details. As an introduction to or review of Greek mythology, it is therefore highly recommendable. Although probably aimed primarily at children, I suppose grown-ups too, if not already expert on the subject, won't find it too elementary."
negative,"Zulus in the Teutoburger Wald?: This movie lost all credibility, and me, after the first battle scene between the Romans and the Germans when the Germans were chanting in Zulu.I'm pretty sure that whoever did the sound editing on this film was high when they inserted that little gem.It sounded great at Rourkes Drift*, but really stupid in the German forest.I assumed that from that point onward the film would go downhill accordingly...and I was not disappointed.* The movie was ""Zulu"" with Michael Caine, Stanley Baker and Jack Hawkins."
negative,"I think I'll go back and hide behind Clementi: I adored this movie in that it dispelled the simulacra of gracious living with classical music. I hated this movie in the shallow way it demonized bdsm culture, much as Irreversible demonized gay men.I was suprised that a young carefree boy in love would suddenly turn judgemental when the object of his affections, his teacher no less, provided instructions for him to please her. I had difficulty making that leap. I was not surprised that a pianist, being a tactile creature, would chose manual engagement for arousal.I thought the scene where Huppert pulled that little box of personal delights from beneath her bed had the greatest amount of compassion and empathy in the film. It was heartbreaking to see how small her world truly was."
negative,Not good..very less lubrication: This product promised a lot. Though it is very thin..the lack of lubrication kills the advantage.Sex is all about the feel and while i understand it has less lub..i didnt expect it to have Zero lube.It is not comfortable for the partner as well.So i wud still stick to Durex that got from Amazon - The deal is good so is the satisfaction
negative,"Good to irritate skin: Apparently I'm not the quickest person as it took me a few months to realize why my face was so irritated. Razor burn and acne like i was in high school again was what this razor did for me. It also hurt, and a clean shave looked 8 hrs old. 5 blades cutting at my face was just to much for me. I've actually reverted back 60 years to a 1950s model Gillette Safety Razor, Badger brush, and mug of shaving cream. The shave is 10x better. It's closer, non irritating, and is an enjoyable experience. If your having skin problems, they may be from these new super duper shavers!"
negative,"The rabbit died: 2 batteriesSynergy Digital BP-308 Lithium-Ion Battery 900mAh - Equivalent to the Canon BP-308 - for use with Canon Optura 600, IXY DVM5, and MVX4i camcordersI purchased for my Canon video camera by Synergy failed to charge after one use.The rabbit that keeps on going came and went, then died in the bushes."
positive,"The old south: Read this book years ago and wanted a copy of it again to read. I was not disappointed, still a good read."
positive,"Worked for Me!: I bought this book, studied for a couple of hours a day for three weeks, made flash cards and learned many of the words on the vocabulary list, took the practice tests on the CD without too many problems (over a period of 6 days), took the GRE, did well, and was admitted to graduate school. It required steady work, but I believe that the book was well worth it in terms of going in to the testing center on the test day and being fairly comfortable (though nervous) with the types of questions and ways of approaching them. I actually found that the math on the actual GRE CAT was easier than I had expected. My plan was to take the GRE only once, if possible, and with the help of this book, my scores were better than anticipated. Because I graduated from college many (30) years ago, I am certain that without the book, I would have had significantly lower scores in all three of the areas."
negative,"Poor, poor transfer: Why pay money for a poor transfer? Wait until the re-release!This sort of studio avarice is akin to that of the distributors of Lord of the Rings, who will release a Blu-ray in the shorter thetrical version in April, only to snatch more of your money by releasing the longer definitive version within the next 12 months thereafter."
negative,Disappointed: Ordered this product for my son. It was broken out of the box. It had a short to the volume button so you can only hear the sound if you put your head directly to the speaker. [...]
negative,"Nowhere near as good as the UK version.: There was a version released in the UK and it includes an excellent 3-D DVD extra disc, you need the right TV to play it but it looks fanatastic. Go for that one instead."
positive,The best attachment you can put on a crib: I received this as a gift at my baby shower. It's the best thing I could've received. My 2 month old falls asleep with the music and bubble effects. I would've given this product 5 stars but the only problem I had with this toy and it's very minor is that the music doesn't last very long. I have to keep on turning it on about 3 or 4 or even more times before my baby falls asleep. He enjoys it so much that when it stops he cries for more. But besides this it's something that everyone should buy and put on the crib.
positive,"""Sam, what do you think?"": This CD has two eerie Stevie Nicks/Faith Hill connections. Number one is ""This Kiss"" - it appears on the Practical Magic soundtrack, as do two Stevie Nicks songs. Number two is ""Somebody Stand Beside Me"" - written by Sheryl Crow, Stevie's version appears on the Boys on the Side soundtrack. Faith takes her version of ""SSBM"" to another level, giving it a more gospel-type feel, the result is awesome.""This Kiss"" is pure bubblegum pop (not necessarily a bad thing). ""Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me"" (with Tim McGraw, surprise!) and ""Let Me Let Go"" are powerful ballads. My favorite track is ""The Secret of Life"", I can't explain why, it just spoke to me I guess.All in all, not a bad CD, it reaffirms Faith's status as they squeaky-clean All-American girl."
positive,a must read book!!!: heavy to read!! still worth it to get to understand how institutions and the masses function over individual persons willing to change our paradigms!!
positive,"Happy Down South: We down south love tomatoes, and the baked tomatoes with cornbread crumbs are some of the best I have ever tried. They not only taste delicious, but the recipe is soooo easy. This lady really knows how to cook southern style.If you like cajun, this is the book to buy. The jambalaya is very easy and feeds a crowd in a hurry. The crawfish pie is a little taste of heaven from down Louisiana way.YOU NEED THIS BOOK!"
positive,"Barbara has a great voice: Wow, Barbara Streisand has such a nice voice. In this musical, I love the songs ""people"", ""I'd rather be blue over you"" and ""I'm the greatest star."" Everyone says that Barbara Streisand is so ugly, but personally, I think she's actually kind of pretty. Yeah, her nose is big, but other than that she's not that bad. Anyway, it's just a really great movie. THe only problem with it is that the romantic scenes were a little too numerous and kind of boring."
negative,"Evolving??: If the word evolving means that you simplify song structures and lyrics and make it more dull and lame then this band is really good at that. How can you say this band is evolving ? Yes it is album that is more easy to listen to when washing the dishes or just hanging around with friends drinking beer, but even so becomes boring. I have a feeling that Dredg has one of the biggest amount of fanboys ever. What they say is totaly irrelevant. I have NEVER wanted this new album to be like El cielo. And i really doubt that other dissapointed reviewers too wanted another El cielo. It is just soulless guys."
negative,"Lost Its Touch!!!!!: this season really changed direction,its not even the same show anymore,hey and whats with Nancie and her change of personality(Her Character)its not her anymore,Conrad is gone the best person in the show,They Shoud just call the Show ""Drug War"" Now, not Weeds,this use to be my number 1 show,now its last,and Nancie has to be the biggest most Stupid Drug Dealer/Pusher,she would have been locked up in season 2 in real life, Another Un THought Out Drama Story"
positive,Awesome movie!: This movie was great and I wasn't disappointed in it at all. It's definitely a different kind of movie so it's refreshing. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it.
negative,"Terrible!: This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen! Awful acting! Vin Diesel made guys like Arnold Swartzenagger look like Oscar material. Samual L Jackson was awful in this movie too, and he's usually a great actor. The one liners that were supposed to be funny weren't, the action scences made you laugh. Like the part where he jump over the house on a motorbike and is able to shoot some guy in mid-air. I would give this 0 starts if I could."
positive,"Groosom: I am from Tampa, Florida. I board at a school in Melborne called Florida Air Academy. My English teacher Mrs. Palmer made me read The Lord Of the Flies and animal farm. Animal Farm was really weird. This Book on the other hand is groosom. They have a little guy with marks on his face getting burned to death. There is also a little kid named Piggy that gets hit in the head with a rock and dies. All the little good kids on the Island die except for Ralph. Ralph was the leader of the kids then jack took over. This book is good for people that like reading about 6 - 12 year old kids killing each other. This book is a symbol of the modern world. When Golding wrote this book he might have been thinking about the future. With these two,seventeen year old kids killing those people in that school. They in a way became like these kids on the island"
negative,Should be triple s for [poor]!!: Boring tedious bad acting I couldn't bring myself even to suspend any belief for the stunts. This film is garbage. I have 1 good thing to say the GTO looked nice.
negative,"You MUST use ""MUSIC"" CDs: This product is no longer worth the trouble. When it was first manufactured, the music industry was trying to guard against unauthorized duplication of CDs. Therefore, the CD-200 (like many other products) was programmed at manufacture to only record on ""MUSIC"" CDs. Music CDs are those for which the manufacturer has paid a royalty to the music industry (probably through RIAA, ASCAP, or BMI), and are specially marked as such. The only place I could find such disks was at Best Buy. In most stores, the pencil-necked teens who staff the music and computer departments have no idea what you are talking about and think, erroneously, that any CD will work. It will NOT. YOU CANNOT USE ""REGULAR"" CD-R DISKS TO RECORD IN THIS MACHINE. So, the best way to make or copy CDs is with a computer with a burning drive --- as most have these days. In most cases, a computer is less expensive. And it is certainly more flexible."
negative,"Sue me: I'm doing something risky here -- I'm giving this movie one star and I haven't even seen it. I'm doing this because the original 1963 movie was not in need of a remake, and nothing in these posts or, more importantly, in any of the professional reviews that came out last summer, has convinced me that I might be even the slightest bit wrong. You can't take a previously filmed story, throw money and technical wizardry at it (not to mention Technicolor), and expect to improve on it. And if you tell me that improving on it wasn't the intent, then why touch it? Are filmmakers supposed to do a *worse* job than their predecessors?"
positive,"A greatly descriptive, touching story: I think this book is excellent because it shows the hardships people had to go through in the great depression. The descriptions of the landscapes were captivating. The ending touching. Exactly what I can expect in a good book."
negative,"Magical Mystery Mediocrity: ""Mind altering music""....yeah sure, believe what you want. And exactly what is the ""phycadelia"" regarding I Am the Walrus? One of the worst albums of 1967. Easily."
negative,"Filled with logical inconsistancies: It was no secret that K had a long term relationship. He told some of his close friends about it. It's a private matter anyway. Radha's account on the other hand is not an expose, it is a nasty, malicious character attack of a man who is dead and can't defend himself.Her book is filled with logical inconsistencies: conclusions that simply do not add up. A book by someone who totally missed the boat for those who've missed the boat and are looking to rationalize it. Radha wrote to me that ultimately because of freedom of speech she can say anything she wants. That's how she justified the logical inconsistencies!! Too bad she didn't have the guts to do that when K was alive."
negative,"Performance enhancement: I added some of this to my protein shake to give me MOAR power. I haven't seen any benefits yet, unless you count growing a tail. I mean, don't get me wrong, the tail gives me better balance...but baby, I need power."
negative,"From Doormat to Divorced: Don't try this in an estabished relationship, the results are disasterous! Change yourself first before trying to mold others. I would like to see who has used this and remained with their man for an extended period of time."
negative,"this movie is an embarassment to the other two movies: sweat, spirited Anne is not meant to be in wrold warI. Anne of Green Gables The Continuing Story is not for kids, unlike the wonderfull first two. THIS MOVIE IS BETTER LEFT ON THE SHELF!!!"
negative,"Not a complete work...: I owned the version from 1987 and bought this thinking it would be an improvement. I only used the first one occasionally, but in my line of work as a Legal Nurse Consultant, I am constantly using a Medical Dictionary & Encyclopedia. Each time I reach for this book now, I know now that what I am looking for will have a good probability of not being in the book, or a poor description. For example, I was looking for the typical symptoms of hypocalcemia - the book tells you ""hypocalcemia - a diminished level of calcium in the blood"" - that's not very helpful.There are many other situations that have rendered my opinion of the usefulness of this book to be minimal if you need to rely on a medical dictionary/encyclopedia.This book was very dissapointing as I am trying to build my library. That is one reason for being able to see a book first, and have a few examples you want to look up in the book before buying."
positive,I LIKE THIS MOVIE ALOT.: THIS IS MY FAVE MOVIE. I LOVE IT. I WATCH IT 5 TIMES A WEEK. PEOPLE AT SCHOOL CALL ME BABY. I LOVE PATRICK SWAYZE. HES A DOLL. THIS MOVIE IS SO ROMANTIC I LOVE IT.
negative,"The Kingless Land: This was a disappointing read. On par with fanfiction at its most mediocre even down to some very overused phrases. The plot was choppy, the action muddy and the premise predictable."
positive,"Great size, great features: This wooden kitchen is the perfect item for people who don't have a huge amount of space and don't want a giant plastic kitchen taking up room. It was pretty simple to put together and has enough features to keep my daughter interested (phone, clock, dials, oven, fake water dispenser, etc.) without driving me insane (nothing makes annoying sounds). Best of all, she can enjoy having a kitchen without it monopolizing our entire basement."
negative,"Broke after a short time: I loved this vacuum at first with the auto-rewind. Auto-rewind is a must with my next vacuum. Unfortunately, this vacuum broke after only using it a handful of times. It got all clogged up. My dad tried to fix it to no avail. It's going in the trash...."
positive,"Great results. I'm going to start up again: Over the winter, i seem to gain alot of weight. As a high school quarterback, that is not acceptable. Last summer, i think i went from 160 to 150. That's my gross weight loss. I'm not even talking about how much fat i lost. I gained a good amount of muscle over the summer, so i probably lost over 15 lbs of fat. I got my six pack back, and life was great. After the season, i just quit, and now my six pack is back in the fridge. I'll probably order some up next week and start again. These are great, and the results are amazing."
positive,the best vitamin: I've been taking Solgar VM75 tablets for over 30 years. I was anemic after college and since taking these rarely get sick. Very satisfied!
positive,"Great CD!!!!: I have to tell you I'am one of those that only buys ""Best Of"" CD'S...I hate to spend the money to only listen to 1 or 2 tracks..With this CD I have listened to every single song from the first time! I can honestly say that this is the only CD I have ever bought that I can listen to again and again. Well worth the price and a CD that will be among my favorites for years to come."
positive,"NICELY DONE EVEN IF A BIT DATED: A bit dated but still nicely done. The tale is more than an excuse to show bare chested guys and surf scenes. There's an actual attempt to cover the surfer culture and even focus on the spiritualism of the sea. Overall, there are some nicely done action scenes and the manner of locating The American Presidents feels believable. Very small role by a thin Tommy Sizemore. Still some great humor scenes, too. Keanu is referred to as ""Young, dumb and full of cum."" LOL MY GRADE: B plus."
positive,Good Western: I enjoyed this movie a lot. The only real problem I had with it was you could tell it was made for TV by the scene changes.
positive,"WHAT HAPPENED TO BESS??????: Now, I know what some of you will think, but here we go. What if Prot or ""Prote"" was actually some being from K-PAX that could take the form of humans or take over the apperance of them sort of like a parasite and a host????????????? We are convinced that Kevin Spacey's character is in fact Robert Porter, but who's to say that Prot did not ""take over"" Robert's body?????? I mean, the camera shut off for a few seconds when it was appraoching the time for him to go and.............................as the title says..............what happened to Bess?????????? Think about it as one possibility. Oh yeah, I loved the movie."
negative,Big Disappointment: I found Mary's voice hard to listen to. It was too shaky to keep my focused on relaxing. I can no longer listen to the CD. I would not recommend this CD to anyone.
positive,"A good read: Assigned to me to be read as before a spirituality seminar, I really enjoyed looking at the theological reflections of this past generation through the eyes of a theologian who is a woman. I was able to relate so much of what she said to experiences I have had with other women who have had a great influence on my own growth of thinking about God in these years."
negative,"Very disappointing: I watched this movie because a friend said it was excellent, and claimed it was better than the Bond series. Being a Bond fan, I wanted to see weither James Bond or xXx was better...I looked forward to the end of xXx. It bored me with its terrible plot line and not-so-witty comments. Also the action was a bit too far fetched. It was horrible.Had it not been a library movie... I would have recycled it."
positive,"I Love the Last Unicorn!: Ever since I could remember, The Last Unicorn had lightened up my world into another. I first watched this movie around the age of 5. I still remember watching it in wonder and thinking how pretty the unicorn is. *Has always been thrilled about them* Now that i'm an adult, I still what the movie and highly recommend it to anyone who loves fastesies, drama, and romance.Watch it! I know you'll love it!"
positive,Cutest Movie!: This a really good version of the classic story for little ones. Total innocence and fun! Disney actually followed the real legend very well and the result is a safe and funny Robin Hood for the younger crowd. Highly recommend!
negative,"Group should be called the 'wonder why' choir...: Please do not get me wrong. I received this collection as a gift and it is quite comprehensive. However, as an elementary school teacher and mom I have had plenty of experience with the genre. I am a firm believer that children deserve the same (or better) quality as adults do (in music and all other things).That said, this recording is very inferior. The recordings are of a quality that makes them unpleasant (almost downright irritating) to listen too. The nice melody, rhythm and careful arranging that goes into other recordings is missing here. The end result is considerably less enjoyable, than say a Raffi or even a Barney CD, and there is a whole lot more of it to endure."
positive,"Suspenseful but interesting: I am a 14 year old hyperactive male. So as anyone would know, being hyperactive, book reading is not a favorite thing. But when I really started to understand the book I became quite intrigued. This book is based on two conflicts: Man vs. Self and Man vs. Man. It gives a great aspect of how civilization turns wild when no control is in order. It also shares two different points of views. There is more irony in this book in any that I have read (which is very few). Not many people would understand cause even I had to ask for help in understanding. This is a great book."
positive,Classic Jane: Persuasion is classic Jane Austen and a good read. I think anyone who likes Jane Austen's prose and character development will not be disappointed.
positive,"Touching story: We have a granddaughter who has cerebral palsy. Her mind is sharp as a tack but she lacks motor skills to do many things other children can do. Her dream is to run and play like other kids. We always tell her God has a special plan for her life. This book is very touching as it addresses the little lamb who was different, but had a very special place in God's plan."
positive,great book: i just love this series its a great book after reading the previous books its funny how josh and beth fall in love and what the rest of the gang has in store. I recommend this book
positive,Good Product: This is a great climbing block with three different heights. It's pretty durable and holds the front wheel just fine. I just wish it was a little less expensive. I literally went to a bicycle shop a couple days after I bought it and saw one for 5 dollars cheaper.
negative,THE ABSOLUTE WORST BOOK THAT WILL EVER EXIST IN THE HISTORY OF ALL BOOKS!: LITTLE WOMEN BY LOUSY LOUISA MAY ALCOTT( I THINK THAT'S HER NAME ) IS THE UTMOST WORST BOOK YOU WILL EVER READ IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IM GOING TO CALL lOUISA lOUSY... BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT DESCRIBES THIS BOOK. lOUSY WRITES A LOUSY 1800'S BOOK THAT IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORING!! THIS BOOK IS VERY INFORMATIVE AND IS NOOO FUN TO READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
positive,"Finally! A Monkees collectible book!: I am late on reviewing this book but had to comment. I LOVE this book. Very goog work and research! Great photography! It's so nice to see someone put this much effort in a Monkees collectible book. My only complaint is the records are not valued correctly. We need a Monkees record collecting guide. If not for values, just to see the great world wide covers of the albums, single and EP's that differ from country to country.Marty Eck ( Is that his real name?)bought most of the items in this book. Since most of us could never afford such a collection or FIND some of these gems, this is a great coffee table book. Again with putting values on collectibles, any kinds, is a matter of supply and demand.To me, Ebay is where I usually can find recent values. Being a Monkees record collector, I am thinking of joining forces with a major colector in the UK to create the book I always wanted. This book is a great asset to anyone's Monkees collection! Buy it!"
positive,"Excellent, strange and dangerous...: One of Stanley Kubricks masterpieces or perhaps ""The masterpiece"". And excellent movie based on Burgess novel from 1962, written in nadsat, a teenage ""streetlanguage"" Burgess invented. The movie describes the evil future society, where Alex and his droogs (friends) make a lot of trouble. Alex get caught and in prison they try the ""Ludovichi"" treatment on him."
negative,"BORING!!: This book can be summed up in one word: BORING. Don't buy it unless you have to for school, even then I wouldn't open it. Read the cliff notes- it's less painful."
negative,"Not the best of Michener's works: Michener's books are always interesting quality historical novels. This was is goodhistory but not easy reading. To anyone who was not in the military, his characters mayseem unreal, but believe me, they aren't!!"
negative,"No You Can Be Much Better Than That: Even Santana cannot afford to release such a deceiving record, it's not even commercial but lacks completely of soul and spirit. On the same time I bought Chavez Reavine by Ry Cooder, there you find soul. Despite it, I will probably see him and his friends on stage this year at the Montreux Jazz Festival"
negative,"Dont Buy!!!: I bought this product when I first got my iphone and it has so many issues, phone doesnt fit properly in this. Im afraid that phone may fell down or the battery connector inside phone may get spoiled as the phone bends. I stopped using this after 1 week."
negative,Possibly The Worst Singer In The World!: I listened to this C.D. a while back & I almost went deaf this cd is awful this chick can not sing & this album is so freaky & scary!I could barely get through this whole cd! If I could give it zero stars I would! I have never heard of her kind of music it's like she has her own music catergory!If your into freaky & different stuff then you probably will like it! all songs have a outer space sound with weird noises!I don't know what I can recommend to you if you like this except anything Bjork!
positive,"Out of date, but good: _Heroes of Civilization_ is Cottler and Jaffe's attempt to give brief biographical sketches of some of the most important scientists of the last few centuries. Their stories are of course somewhat dated now, but they still capture the thrill and charm of scientific discovery. PAsteur and Robert Koch are among those profiled. Appropriate for children."
positive,Great buy!: Haven't used these yet but they feel great and the price couldn't be beat. Timely delivery too. No wonder they're out of stock now!
positive,Not bad for a remake: I have never been much of a fan of remakes or sequels but I didn't think this one was so bad. It stars Tony Todd(Candyman) and has the same plot as the original. Maybe I'm partial to this one because it's done in color and I belive the special effects are better. The movie overall is creepy and wastes no time in getting to the good stuff. Of course in most horror movies there isn't much of a storyline but if you wanted a storyline you wouldn't be watching a horror flick. If you saw the original Night of the Living Dead I believe you should see this version as well and compare for yourself. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
negative,Not original blades: Not by Gillete. Do not work as the originals. I have been using Fusion for a long time and I'm sure these blades are not the same that I have used before.
negative,"Boring, One Sided, Inaccurate: My review title pretty much says it all.One sided books are fine if not disguised. This book has an agenda, anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Facts contained are presented with all the reasons one should be anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Many facts aren't fact, like the statement that Asda took over J Sainsbury's in 2003 - didn't happen.As the world's largest and most successful retailer there are many more interesting books about Wal-Mart. Fine if you're anti Wal-Mart or pro union.......but don't preach, make a book, let me decide!"
negative,"Beware of shill reviews.: I'm really getting irritated by publishers, authors and their friends writing five star reviews for their own books. If you click on the ""see all my reviews"" button next to almost all of the five star reviews, you'll see that they only have one review. This is no coincidence.You might also notice that the less than positive reviews for this have a lot of unhelpful votes, too; that's probably the publisher or author at work again. The saddest thing is that I actually liked this book, but I'm not prepared to give it a positive review in the midst of such dishonesty."
negative,"shameless: J.R.R. Tolkien: 'The time of the Elves has passed."" Christopher Paolini: ""The time of the Riders has passed."" Hmmm. You may not agree with me, but I'd call that cheating in a big way. As a mother, I think it's too bad this author is getting so much press when what he did was quilt together patches from any fantasy source I can think of--books, movies, games--and the stitching isn't even very good. Since when is it 'classic' to take what others have done and call it your own? Although I didn't see anything truly original in this boo, having read other fantasy authors, I wonder how Paolini would feel if there had been something really original in his book and someone else had taken it and made a fortune off of it. Well you might not agree, but what should I say to my own kids about givin gcredit where credit is due?"
negative,"Do Not Buy!!!!!!!!!: The dvd was professionally done. Unfortunately, I don't think that it depicted the reality of families in Vietnam. The producers portrayed the typical ""city"" family lifestyle as one of luxury. It's difficult to believe that the average ""city"" family in a Third World Country drives a new sedan and and has a housemaid. Oh, I also forgot the grand piano.The filming of the ""country"" family was well done (too well done). The family scenes were idealic and serene. I think that the producers wore their rose-colored glasses when they were filming this. It made life in the country seem like a vacation.I'm not sure what audience this dvd was trying to target but for those who want realism, I would recommend something else."
positive,Just Like New: Saved alot of money. Looks brand spank'n new and works like a charm.I have purchased two other remanufactured cusinart products from Amazon and they were also about 70% less than retail and they both were like brand new.
positive,"So easy to use: I've tried several different wired and wireless adapters for the TiVo. This one is the easiest to set up. You just plug it in and it's ready. The connection is well built, not flimsy like several other adapters I've tried."
negative,"Boring: I was made to read this for English and thoroughly disliked every moment of it. I thought the plot was boring and it wasn't nearly as good as everyone appears to believe it is.The only reason I am not giving 1 star is because when I look back on the story I can sort of see it being realistic, but then again every time I hear mention of this book I pretty much get nightmares."
negative,"Only five of the eight cartoons are Betty Boop: The title of this DVD is misleading. Of the eight cartoons, only the first five are Betty Boop. The other three are irrelevant. The quality of the picture is poor."
positive,Nice Tracy and Hepburn Film: This is a disarming little movie about a woman athlete and her coach. It is a somewhat romantic comedy but it is more about developing a female athlete and coaching her to be a winner. Katherine Hepburn was apparently a terrific athlete and Garson and Kanin wrote their screenplay around her. It is not a raccuous or exaggerated romantic comedy like Adam's Rib or even Woman of the Year. It is much smaller but very charming. Take it for what it is and don't expect it to be like the other films. This is not what Pat and Mike are about.
positive,"Wonderful: I read The Secret just before reading this one. It was a wonderful lead-in to Ransom. I couldn't put this book down. I feel in love with Broderick and Gillian. And it was great to include Iain & Judith Maitland. You always wonder what happens to the characters in the other books, and it's great when you see what happens to them."
positive,"Perfect Fiction: One Hundred Years of solitude is close to perfection as fiction can get. Challenging, epic, and stunningly beautiful writing. As worth the effort as any book you will ever read, it is a vast work to get completely lost in."
positive,"Seek no further if you love melancholy music!: This is it. The best, most heartfelt debut I've heard in a long, long while. Lhasa sings of love, rejection, defiance, vanity, birds in the desert, the fish in the river, the tree of forgetfulness, all with a voice that is now sweet as desire, now wrenching as a lover's scorn. The music reminds me alternately of fado, klezmer, cabaret and Kurt Weill. And the girl is only 25. One can only wait with bated breath and hope it won't be too long before the second album appears. Meanwhile, I'll try not to wear out this CD!"
negative,"AWFUL - DO NOT BUY: I got this printer for x-mas. Withen 3 months the rollers that pull the paper into the printer had broken, rendering the printer completely useless. I couldn't return it, so I was stuck with a large piece of junk. This complimented my HP laptop that broke at the same time due to a manufacture's recalled power fan. Bottom line, DO NOT BY HP."
negative,"A Matter of Spellling: Does it matter how you get there? It's impossible to say if Aiken would sound different atop the virtual Mount McKinley if he had worked his way up and wrote his own songs. I think it would, because the sameness of the tracks are as alive as echoes in an anechoic chamber. How do you spell ""sucks""?"
negative,"China Cry: I am very disappointed. This is certainly not what I expected. The movie based on ""China Cry"" recently played on TBN and I wanted to read the book. This was a 6X4 paperback, 60 pages and 3 additional pages of old black and white photos.I expected to receive a full size book. For anyone who is considering buying this book, I advise you to keep looking at the books offered by other sellers or go to a book store or public library. I will be much more careful in reading the full description before I place any other orders."
positive,Poor Postman: I ordered this product to the dis-fortune of our postman.Day 1. He seemed fineDay 2. Teeth & Finger nails have fallen outDay 3. Complete hair loss and obvious weakening and deterioration of the muscles.Day 4. We got no post.
positive,"The story is a bit campy, but the flying scenes are excellent!: This is a movie that does a great job of using CGI to create some awesome scenes. Despite the formula plot and silly side-show drama, the flying scenes make this movie worth watching over and over."
positive,"Many Twists and Turns: I read a couple of Abrahams books a few years ago and decided recently to buy another. ""Lights Out"" is a fast paced book with many twists and turns. It has quirky elements which make it interesting/""light reading"".I have been surprised at the difference in books written by Abrahams that are based in a location he dubs Echo Falls. Those books appear to be written for a young audience. (The single one I bought definitely was.) This not one of those books but one written for an adult audience."
negative,"Great expectations, almost-as-great disappointment: Scripting is a hot, extremely-important topic, and Barron is to be commended for the very idea of basing a whole book on presenting and surveying it. However, the execution of this good idea turns out to be far too flawed -- this book is NOT to be recommended. There is no coverage of the most important, up-and-coming scripting languages, particularly Python; this is a truly damning defect. The role of scripting in conjunction with XML, EJB/Corba, databases, and other crucial technologies is absent. Nothing about scripting's use for component prototyping, its connection with the Extreme Programming movement, integration of scripting in one's general or special purpose applications; nothing on the vital issue of interaction between scripting and security. A pity: this book could have been far, far more than what it turned out to be. As it is, it provides little or nothing that's not already and better available elsewhere."
positive,"great!: perfect for my using to froth milk for my morning coffee, or my after dinner decaf! Love it! Would purchase again."
negative,"I really dont get it: I know I am only 13 years old and I do not wish to offend anybig Ulysses fans, but I had no idea what this book was on about? I will reread it perhaps in 30 years and appreciate it more. However, for the time being, those who proclaim it the greatest book of the century only have to read any of The Lord of the Rings, Catch-22, 1984 or To Kill a Mockingbird to see they are sadly mistaken END"
positive,"Wow, Ow and What's that smell?: I have been using this for 3 weeks now and while I have seen no difference in my measurements, my posture is definitely improved. I have also lost about 6 pounds, which is likely due to my combination of diet and exercise, but I have also been wearing the corset at least 4 days a week for up to 9 hours at a time.I am 5'9"" 150 pounds and I bought a size Small and it fits how it should, super tight. I look forward to eventually going in to the second hooks.My only complaint is the SMELL. It smells like rubber and while I hope no one around me really notices, I notice. I wear a wrap around my midsection underneath it, but after all day the smell still gets on and stays on my skin.Otherwise, the construction is super sturdy and I anticipate only needed one for a long time. Hopefully the smell will fade with more hand washes..."
negative,"The Scarlett Letter: Overall ok. Not much going on here. A lot of internal dialogue, nothing like the movie. I prefer the movie to the book."
positive,"Excellent drive!: I'm quite happy with this drive. It's fast. It's slim enough to fit into USB ports in the front of the Dell PCs at school that are designed poorly enough to not allow some larger (but still normal sized) USB drives. With the nice aluminum casing it appears that I will never have problems like I've had in the past when my plastic casing broke, making my drives useless.It seems that nearly everyone in my department at school has got some kind of flash drive, but I haven't seen any that rival this one."
positive,Comfortable nights sleep in a cabin: This product was comfortable for my husband and I. I have back problems and needed something to support my back but not too firm. It worked fine. Only problem was trying to get up from that low on the floor but we managed.
positive,"A classic.: This is one of my favorite Disney films of the early years. This blu-ray edition is perfect in almost every sense of the word. The sound and picture quality are superb. This is a movie many families have come to know and love for ages now. For those who have yet to see it, I will not spoil the story, but instead encourage you to pick up a copy and watch it yourself, you will not regret it at all. This movie is one of those gems that stood the test of time, and with a little magic and digital touch-up it is guaranteed to add value to any movie collection."
positive,"Disappointing binding: The story is great, quite enjoyable to read with our son. I am disappointed with the binding, it's basically a paperback book with hard covers. Not good quality paper for the text block at all, not sure it's worth it buying the hardcover if the inside pages will yellow and turn brittle over time like paperbacks do."
negative,"technical problems with cassettes: This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left. Most auto systems have that capability. However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound, it can be difficult (and maybe impossible) to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time. Unfortunately neither the packaging nor the website will warn you of the problem. You therefore should think before buying. Once you have opened the packaging you may be unable to return the product."
negative,"Way Overrated: Pretty dumb, unrealistic, and not scary at all. In comparison just shows how great, realistic and well made The Exorcist is."
negative,"SCARY!: I found this book offering a somewhat scary look at society. Golding seems to think that without society men are just in need of violence and sex, and the book totally forgets about women. I did not care for this book, and found it somewhat hard to follow."
positive,Good deal: Not official NFL product but saved money and quality was good enough. This product will keep your head warm and show your Team pride.
negative,"Great movie, ruined by touchstone DVD politics..: Touchstone has decided to force you to watch two trailers EVERY SINGLE TIME you insert the disc in your player. The only function allowed is power off and eject. Don't get me wrong the movie is very good, but the DVD execution is terrible. If I had known this, I would never have bought it."
negative,"Not Anywhere Near The Original: Let me start off by saying I loved the first Airplane and consider it to be the best comedy ever. So I'm not a hater of the genre. When I first saw Airplane about two years ago I laughed until I cried. Just days after seeing it I was in an electronic store and saw Airplane 2 on DVD. Assuming it was made by the guys that made the original I bought it, oh how wrong I was. This is nothing but a sad attempt to copy the success of the original. Paramount asked the Zuckers and Jim Abrahams to do the sequel, when they declined saying there's not enough jokes left to do a sequel Paramount just hired some other guy to do it. The result, Airplane 2 crashes and burns."
negative,"Does not work, electrical problem: Just received it, plugged it in after watching DVD and reading instructions but it would not go on; tried reset button etc. with no luck. Will have to send it back. I have purchased other Conair products over the years but this was a big disappointmnet because I didn't get a chance to use it."
negative,Disappointing: Repetitious and disappointing for someone who bought all Santana records LP's CDs and DVDs.
positive,"Reflective and Multi-layered: Still Love in Strange Places takes readers on an exquisite journey to a foreign place (El Salvador) and also deep into the heart of a marriage, into questions of identity and place. Kephart is really asking the questions, To whom do memories and stories belong? and How are cultural legacies passed down to a child. A fascinating book."
negative,"Not impressed: Card installed, but never worked correctly. Tried upgrades from Belkin, had assistance from tech support. Nothing worked. This was on a Sony z505hs with windows 2000. Everything else works fine in this computer/pc card port, not the Belkin card."
positive,"Old Hollywood History at it's best...: Being a native San Franciscan, I've always been fascinated by the ""real"" backstory on the Arbuckle scandal. Jerry Stahl's novel takes you back to a time where the true person and his/her Tinseltown facade were as separate as California is from Florida. The first-person narrative style is great, told in the ""lingo"" of the day. I recommend this book highly."
positive,3 Michener's Read: Although this isn's as good as the other two I've read (Hawaii and Cenntenial) it is still an incredible book. One thing is it skips the interesting but after a few pages boring beginning about the creation of the land. It opened my mind to great deal about the Caribbean. This is a great read and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good read about the Caribbean.
positive,harry potter and the goblet of fire: this is a great movie and I got it sent to me in a reasonable time and it was a wonderful service thank you very much.
negative,"A Bit Preachy: This is primarily Grey's diatribe and condemnation of the lack of support of returning WWI combat veterans. A historical note: Those vets received no benefits and more than 200,000 U.S. soldiers suffered physical or mental injuries during The Great War, but in 1919 only 217 had completed rehabilitation programs. That sad chapter has similarities with the Walter Reed Hospital scandal over substandard treatment of U.S. troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan.Bless Grey for taking up the cause back in the day, it must not have been very popular to do so at the time, but it got weary hearing one of the primary characters wax on and on about that issue. In addition, I had a real problem with the ending...suffice to say it would not have played out that way. He wrote better books."
positive,"Works very well: I replaced my old Tivo adapter because I purchased a new router. Thankfully, this adapter supports WPA2/PSK, so I don't have to dumb down my network security anymore to support one device.Other than that, works as designed. Recommended."
negative,"TORCHER: AGU! Man The book is Finally over with! That was torcher PLUS the movie was violent causing me to continue screaming and my classmates thinking I was insane! I gotta piece of advice, DONT BUY THE BOOK"
positive,Readinggirl Never Sent The Book: I bought this book from another seller after Readinggirl never sent my book. It was a gift for my daughter's boyfriend after my dog chewed up his other one. I wanted to replace it with the same year/same cover. This seller never even responded to the three attempts to contact her. She tied up my money for a month. Buyer beware!
positive,"Use of language: I was surprised at how little was lost in the translation of this book. Garcia writes this novel as if it were poetry, he has a wonderful use of language that seems to braid mystical as well as humurous aspects into his writing. This is a novel that I won't forget and recommend readily."
positive,"Woburn: Forgotten Tales & Untold Stories: I purchased this book hoping to find some history of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson, helped found. Although there was little mention of people from my direct line, this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630. The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories. This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today. This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States."
positive,"Good choice for light duty homeowners: I bought this since the big MK I also use was too heavy and messy to take into condos. I rehab ocean condos and lug all my tools into the condo for 2-3 months (compressor, table saw, router table, etc). So I focus on portability first.However, the instructions were limited, the arbor allows the blade to not spin true, and the setup screws will be quickly lost after unpacking.But strangely - the saw and fence quickly cut straight after you allow for the width of the blade wobble. Angles require some extra work. I used a 7"" speed square against the fence for diagonal cuts. I haven't tried the 1.3"" cutting depth yet. It should do it. But for how long? I don't see it as a long term contractor grade saw but as a saw that can be used for 2-3 yrs with about 2-3 jobs per year."
positive,"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (Books of Wonder): 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (Books of Wonder)is one of my favourite books of all time. Verne has managed to writing an intriguing, invigorating and adventure-filled adventure that also delves into questions morality and religion. Verne's love of science and technology is a leading theme through out the book and one gets a lesson in the marine-life as it was known during his lifetime. The illustrations by the Dillon's are certainly a work of art to bestow and admire. The afterword by Peter Glassman is very well-written and informative. I can highly recommend this book to readers of all ages and I gave this amazing classic a strong 5/5. 5/5."
positive,"Flawless: Worked like a charm all over England. I haven't tried the other adaptors, but I found my MacBook to work just like it does here in the US, and there was no difficulty plugging into the outlets."
positive,Nice Book: You get a nice book for the price. The footnotes help with understanding for younger readers and those not familiar with the English time frame in which Austen wrote.
negative,"Unreliable: This book is not serious scholarship, it is merely an op-ed piece. The author, Michael Parenti does not provide any footnotes to back up his claims; strange coming from a scholar from Yale. No matter how much is said that conforms to my beliefs about politics it simply cannot be relied on as there is almost no evidence within."
negative,Did not work for me: I did not find that it helped remove toxins which is what I was hoping it would do. It did loosen the bowel.
negative,"Stop! You can't get Amazon Prime videos on this!: Stop! You can't get Amazon Prime videos on this! It's also has linking problems that TiVo kept sending me to Amazon for, and Amazon then just showed me how to fix it on my TiVo, when TiVo could have told me. And they charge a monthly fee. Roku has no fee, it's cheaper, and easier to use."
negative,"They done been listenin' to dat hill country stuff: Obviously these guys have invested heavily into the North Mississippi hill country blues of R.L., Junior Kimbrough et al, via the Fat Possum catalog. Although it is mildly entertaining, why spend your filthy lucre on the imitation stuff when you can have the real deal? Search out the real innovators of this sound, they've been doing it a lot longer (and better) with more soul and authenticity than the boys from Akron."
positive,"Reagan Recessional: How appropriate that the end-credit score from a war movie was performed as Reagan made his final exit from his funeral. I was introduced to two incredible pieces of music from Princess Diana's funeral: the processional (Funeral Sentences) and the recessional (Alleluia by Tavener). Now there's this hauntingly moving music. I would expect a CD to be released of the funeral (perhaps to benefit Alzheimer's research). Meanwhile, there's this soundtrack, which will now forever be linked to Reagan's funeral. And even more, Nick Glennie-Smith has now entered a new realm for musicians."
positive,"Buy it!: Don't expect any bat junk like ""shark repellant"" in this one. It's darker than Tim Burton's and it complexly makes you forget about all the other modern incarnations of PG rated goffery. This film has a great build up and a great explanation of things. Bruce works hard and fails continually, we get to see him develop and suffer and most importantly we get a great new Bat Mobile.The only problem I had with this film is that the scarecrow just seems unnecessary. The movie worked so hard to present a new kind of realism that seems detracted from one that stupid mask appears. Henri Ducard was a good enough villain and the scarecrow just seemed to get in the way.Still all in all, this is a great picture - one that you can easily watch over and over."
negative,"Somewhat disappointed: I read Here and Now first then Behind Closed Doors, I wasn't that enthused about Casting the First Stone. Many of the chapters seemed to be long and boring and reiterating the same dialogue. However I do comend Kim on choosing a very touchy topic, but her approach wasn't that clever."
negative,"What has happened to Stephen King?: Journals is nothing more than a teaser for the upcoming ABC movie. The story is not original and, frankly, much of it doesn't even make sense. I have been a King fan since Salem's Lot when I was only in high school. I have always looked forward to his new releases. After the Ellen Rimbauer dud and now this one, I wonder if King has lost his spark. His writings have, in the past, always had an edge that made you wonder what was going on in his head. This book and the Ellen Rimbauer Diary are like warmed up leftovers. My advice is don't waste your time on this book."
negative,"Almost All Fighting, Next to No Interesting Dialogue: This movie is essentially a 2-hour fight scene with about 20 minutes of half-interesting dialogue and story sprinkled in. Terribly violent and uninteresting. Honestly the most fighting I have ever seen in any movie (including Matrix Reloaded). I wholly regret the $1.99 I spent to rent it. Unless you want to see endless stabbings and blunt force traumas, do not see this movie."
positive,"Amazing show: The Second Season of Sanctuary was incredible. Although I loved the first season, it was more of an introduction to the show than anything else. The second season allowed for more exploration of the characters and the story lines, and did so remarkably well.I never thought I would like a 'Sci Fci' show, but this really isn't. It's not more 'out there' than Lost or Fringe or any of the other shows on basic networks. I would recommend it to everyone."
negative,OK: I really like songs for a new world and the last 5 years. was excited to purchase this disc but was kinda disappointed. lacks the edgy variation and creativity of the others. not bad and the cover track is fun--just not up to the success of the other jason robert brown work.
negative,"Shouldn't history be somewhat correct?: I only have to say this, historical facts can be correct, and still have good or even better fiction. Anya Seton proved that, with Katherine. Fact it seems, as in Elizabeth 1, if studied, is far far more interesting than any fiction made to soup up a book or even film. Philipa Gregory blurs truth and makes it sad, for I rate the book as well as the movie next to nothing.J. Schossow"
positive,"Book, stage or silver screen: It's hard to mess up Little Women. This is a book to read and reread throughout the ages and stages of your life. (I always thought of myself as a a Jo!)"
positive,"""The horror. The horror."": Having been an on and off Stephen King fan for many years, I picked this book up pretty quick. I had heard both good and bad comments about this one, so I wasn't sure what I was in for. I was so amazed by the first hundred pages. The way in which we are introduced to our main characters is brilliant. The flashbacks to childhood days in Derry are well timed and never grow repetitive.What will stick with my are the suttle and not so suttle references to Conrad's Heart of Darkness, as well as Apocalypse Now. Imagine Conrad's amazement at the story of the Congo River becoming Vietnam, and now the Maine wilderness.If you haven't read this yet, as Duddits would say, ""got some work to do now."""
positive,"A wake-up call to the Playboy culture....: This book is an extraordinary, shocking content analysis of Playboy magazine through the years. Hugh Hefner, rather than the slightly-roguish but benign pioneer of openness he is often portrayed to be, emerges as an agenda-pushing cad with a disdain for marriage, family, children, monogamy, and ultimately, women. After reading this book, one could ever again say ""it's only Playboy."""
negative,Snore...ZZZZZZZZ: While Clay has a great voice this album was a total bore. Every song sounds exactly the same and I am glad I only listened to the album and didn't waste my money. There are about two good songs off the album and I am already want to puke from hearing one of them.
positive,Decent headphones for the money: Sound quality very good. Noise canceling feature works quite well considering the size of the headphones. Major drawback is the separate power pack needed to power the noise canceling.
positive,One of her very best!!!: I loved it!!! If you loved The Secret (and Julie Garwoods other medieval stories) you will love this one just as much-- or more. You can't help but read it all at once. It's too good to put down and totally worth feeling sleepy over the next morning because you couldn't. I can't wait to see who's story we get next....
positive,Awesome: This book was truly captivating. This is definitely a must have and a must read. It keeps you wanting more.
negative,"This is the worst printer I've ever seen: DON'T BUY THIS HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!! I was given this as a gift, so thankfully didn't spend any money on it. It simply will not print. I usually spend about half an hour and end up with at least 30 ruined sheets of paper to print one page.In looking online, I can see that other users have had the same problem. Apparently the feed mechanism is faulty.Very faulty.I find my blood pressure rising just looking at the printer.Please buy any printer other than this one. And I'm staying away from HP in the future."
positive,"Cosmological Eye: I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in getting into Miller. There are many great examples of his works, without the commitment of an entire book. Henry really has a handle on what it means to be human."
negative,Boring!: The film has Skinner (Mel Gibson) as a FBI agent sent to a low life hotel to investigate the death of an artist named Izzy (Tim Roth.) Everyone thinks that it was just suicied. But old Skinner knows better and through some searching comes up with his own idea. The film also has Tom-Tom (Jeremy Davies)who's best friend was Izzy as the main suspect. But the film goes and does nothing but burn up two hours. You can even see Mel yawning on screen.It is the one Mel Gibson film we should like to forget. Grade:D-
negative,"Cheaply made: Like other reviewers, my zen garden arrived with the bottom falling apart. Had I tried to add the sand, it would have poured out the bottom. It was so visibly defective that I'm shocked that it made it out of the factory. I sent it back."
positive,"I love this stuff: The Pills are gel caps a lil larger than i thought they would be ,but i bought this to clear up acne and control pms symptoms and so far i love it and my skin is looking amazing after only 3 days so i would reccomend this to every one also a plus my cervical mucus is back i was dry before so i just love this product"
negative,"Not for Windows 7 64bit AS Stated!: When I received this unit I went over the installation guide and ran the BOOT Disk as stated for Windows 7 64bit and the software crashed everytime. I installed the software as stated not to to try and see if it would work, NO LUCK. The HDD cabinet and USB cord were good quality and I just ended up using them for my old HDD after I took it out of my Laptop as an external drive for backing up my computer."
positive,"Accessible and informative: Warren presents this book as largely a primer on BDSM. Indeed, it's ideal for a newcomer to the scene. If you are more familiar with BDSM, you'll still find enough fresh ideas to make the book worthwhile. Warren's upbeat, almost breezy voice makes it a very enjoyable read, too."
positive,"Easy to Use: I love this hair dryer! I have medium wavy hair with a tendency to frizz. Before this hair dryer I had to use curlers to keep the frizz away. Now I just use a little anti-frizz product on my wet hair, partially air dry, and finish with the hair dryer. My hair looks like it was professionally styled! I love how I can control how staight or curly I want it. Also this works great for touch ups."
negative,"NOT Mac-supported: I bought this player for two reasons - 1) it came with an FM radio which I want when I travel 2) it is supposedly Mac-compatible. After an hour of messing around with it, I called support (and got help on the second try). The guy said that they were not going to support it for iTunes 2, so if you've stayed current with the Mac software, you cannot use this player. I found an old version of iTunes, which did work with the player, but you still cannot use the 2x compression, which was another selling factor for me. Too bad, I liked the unit, but need one that will be supported!"
negative,Worst Vacuum Cleaner ever!: This is the worst product I have ever used. It doesn't pick up anything. The rewind cord is nice but it is the only thing about this vacuum cleaner that works.
negative,"Is It Closer? I Still Can't Tell: I bought the Opteka 2X Telephoto lens for my Olympus C-8080 Camedia Digital Camera so I could zoom in closer to my subject or scene.Unfortunately, I have not noticed much of, if any useful difference in the closeness of the subject or scene.And the lens attachment has one terribly annoying side effect: Whatever you zoom in on, is surrounded by a black circle and yes, it comes out in your photo creating the effect as if you had taken it through a telecope or pericope.Maybe I'm not using it right, but I have followed any instructions given, and it's just not right.Buy if you don't mind a periscope effect or just need a slight edge in aooming in closer, go ahead and buy it, it's cheaper than the T-Con which I'm starting to regret I didn't buy because it said only 1.4X zoom.Hope this helps."
positive,"I'm taking over the world: The shipment was fast and came in a glad bag as an added protection. They didn't even require a signature for the package, so that was nice as I don't want people to know that I'm planning to take over the world with thise uranium ore."
negative,"Piece of junk: Worst printer I've ever bought. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!! Constant Paper Jams, thick black line through scans/copies even after troubleshooting, annoying polling every couple minutes. This is probably going to be the last HP printer I ever buy. I was ripped off for a premium-line printer. I'm replacing it with a cheaper but more reliable Canon MP160 which does everything this one was supposed to and I've never had a single problem with it."
positive,A gloious fantasy that deserves to be in kids'hands: I wanted this book for a special boy I know who is learning to read and to deal with many hurtful things. It was a great comfort to me as a kid ( m a n y moons ago). Please request it from the publisher!
positive,"an original and wonderful movie: i have seen this movie in the french version and i think that the movie and the story are very interesting, even if i didn't understand the last 2 picture of the movie."
negative,"PlasPlug Master Tile Cutter: Bought at Home Depot for $199. It is a toy, not suitable for serious work. Flimsy contruction, difficult or impossible to adjust. Recommend getting a brand name."
negative,"Informative yet...: 'In the Heart of the Sea' is a classic story of sailors stranded at sea. However it does have some gruesome parts that classic stories like 'Moby Dick' and 'Two Years before the Mast' don't have. For instance there is much death and cannibilism. The story is told by a narrattor and is about how the Nantucket whaleship, the Essex, is wrecked by a sperm whale and how they must survive in three whaleboats with built up sides. The story is true and what the book, Moby Dick, is based on.This book is very imformative but I did not like the way it was written and it dragged in many parts. I would not recomend this book."
positive,"Strong and thorough overview, problem with prophecy: Overall, the book is well presented and breaks down not just each book in the Bible, but also the topics or teachings from each book. I found it very thorough (though this is not to be confused with a Biblical history text) with enough information to keep perspectives of timelines and order of events in our history. Specifically, she explained very well the times of the prophets and possible relationships to one another. Mrs. Mears is clearly a dispensationalist regarding eschatology (study of the end times). Meaning, she believes that prophecy is interpreted in a specific way with which I disagree. I do not think this detracts from her Biblical knowledge or that she has a saving faith in any way; I just want potential readers to know this in advance that her book espouses a specific view of prophecy and the end times. I find the book very good and helpful overall."
positive,"Fascinating study of the universe and our earth.: As this material is quite deep, it is recommended that you view these discussions often in order to learn something new with every viewing. The postulations are quite reasonable and the dialogue makes one thirst for more knowledge and teaching about God's creation miracles."
positive,"love it: I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early. The seller discribed it well in the write up so I knew exactly what I was geting and was happy on the transaction."
positive,"wonderful book: I found this book to be a very good read, and I couldn't put it down. I wanted to read more about the love/hate relationship of sisters, the love triangles, the power struggles. After finishing this one, I read The Queen's Lover, and now I'm finishing The Queen's Fool. The books are thick but the pages turn very quickly, a wonderful historic fiction!"
positive,"a must for new moms!!!!!: I love this thing!!! I had never heard about them until I saw it in a pregnancy magazine. I then came online to read the reviews and ended up buying one for myself. It's great for breast feeders and bottle feeders! It puts the baby at the perfect level. My mom-in-law uses it just to hold the baby because it cradles the baby and allows your arms to relax. The cover is easy to wash, you just zip it right off! My daughter is 6 months now and I still use it. I put it on the floor and put her in it. It supports her enough so she won't tip over, but helped her learn to sit on her own. It also works as a great pillow and neck support for lying on the floor or couch. i recommend it to everyone!!!"
negative,"I really want to like it: I really want to like it. It is certainly better than the Huggies I bought before but the quality is no where close to the pamper's cruiser we have been using. It is good if you knew you will change diaper frequently as it will hold just one pee then start to sag. I haven't run into any leaking issue yet as I now use it only when I knew my baby will not stay with it for long. We use it as temporary diaper that is why I still give it a two star rating. It is cheaper for more diapers, you get what you paid for."
positive,"Great classic for the price: For a first time reading of this classic I recommend this. If you love it you may want a nicer version for the bookshelf. This is a nice quality book though. The printing isn't too small, and neither is the book. It fits right in my paperback bookshelf perfectly with others just like it.And as for the story, I could go on many pages. Just do a few searches for reviews, it's a classic that will outlive all of us and has a lot to say about human beings and our culture, past and future.One of the best Classics, great one to get started on or to read over and over again."
negative,"not fresh: The beens are good big size, but have mold. So I do not think the beens are fresh. I will not buy from them again. Because people buy organic food for safety and freshness.The seller let me return the beens and refund the money promptly."
negative,"note to self: read reviews before buying: I'm now on my third charger for my Powerbook (my dad says I'm rough on equipment). Let me tell you, the Macally is NOT it. Like others, it fluctuates between charging and battery every 1-2 seconds and the brick makes weird squeaky noises. After not having a computer for a week and being so relived to finally get this charger, I was almost in tears to find that it is a piece of crap. It charges when the computer is off or in sleep mode, but that's not going to cut it. If you have a Powerbook G4, don't waste your money on this."
positive,"There's something about Joseph Arthur...: This is probably my favorite Joseph Arthur album he's the kind of artist I think would be an intresting person to meet. He's also the kind of artist you can listen to at night and dream of places you've never been but plain to, or even just hope to visit. On a subtle summer afternoon you can listen to him and almost take joy in the mosquitos biting. You can even listen to him on a hard rainy day and be happy in the midst of a great depression. This musician, on this album especially, has the ability to mellow out any great feelings of sorrow or ectasy and just make you feel content. And you get your moneys worth with eighteen tracks.And to Vincent, Please, in the future can you refrain from confusing someones beleifs with the quality of their music?"
positive,"4 stars because I did enjoy reading it even though...: ... I was really expecting a lot more from this book. I purchased it for the story ""Don't Look Now"", which is often said is a mere shadow of what I think is a great film(even though the book came first). I felt that all of the stories pulled you in to begin with, but the endings were just flat? ""Not after Midnight"" was pretty good but again the ending did no justice. ""The Way of the Cross"" was also interesting, great character development from the little boy ""Robin"" way too wise for his age and ""Rev. Babcock"" talk about conflicted! But again the ending just left you empty? Not that I wanted blood and ghastliness, but just a bit more force or painful irony,à la ""The Twilight Zone""This is a good book to read to and from work (if you take the train or bus of course!)"
negative,"Disappointing: I am a huge Robert De Niro fan. I love gangster genre movies. This film was really bad in my opinion. Extremely predictable to the point of nausea and the audience is force fed the rights and wrongs of life to the point where you want to throw this movie out the window. I also saw it when it first opened in theaters and I was really let down.There are a few good moments, all in all not the worst movie ever. There is no way this can be ranked with any of De Niro's really great movies though. If he was trying to use everything he learned from Scorscese he must not have learned too much.Again, this is my humble opinion. What do I know? But if you are thinking of buying this, make sure you rent it first. I wouldn't want this movie in my house."

positive,"The Hobbit Movie (1978): I'm 29 years old. I've have a copy of this movie for years. It's getting very worn, and was not good to begin with due to the fact that it was a copy of a copy, but this movie is still great! This is a must have for any Tolkien fan, of any age. I'm going to buy myself a new copy here today. I can hardly wait for it to arrive."
negative,out of stock?: When item was ordered it was in stock I waited 4 days that I could have ordered another item just to be emailed out of stock. The money was taken out of my account so I couldnt even buy anything else. very irritated I need this hat for a xmas gift wont be buying from this company again.
negative,didn't get mine either: I ordered these for a Christmas gift. They were backordered so I got a new ship date. They cancelled the order after the end of the new shipping window. No explanation- just didn't send them. I'd be cautious about ordering from Fogdog.
negative,"Depressing: While the book is well written I have had a whale of a time getting through it. It has taken me three weeks to get past the second part. I get the premise of what she is writing about, I just find it to be terribly and overwhelmingly depressing. Tell me it gets better."
negative,This toy is JUNK!: I ordered two of these for my kids. The pump for the rocket is made so you have to hold it while pumping but there is no good way to hold it securely while pumping. There is a trigger to lock in the rocket while pumping but the trigger is in the way of holding the pump and is unsafe because a simple bump makes the rocket launch accidentally. The piston in the pump is so cheap that it bends when you push it in. The end cap on the pump chamber is not properly secured to the pump. I tried the pumps that came with both rockets. The rocket's highest flight was about 10 feet becuase the pumps were so lame.
positive,"One of Conrad's Finest: Lord Jim is the story of a young ship's officer who makes an inexplicable mistake. Branded a coward and stripped of his license as a sailor, Jim is unable to bear the stigma attached to his life for a brief moment of cowardice. Jim seeks redemption on a small Malay island, only to fail for what one of the characters calls, ""...a shred of meaningless honor..."". A truly great work of fiction, Lord Jim is linguistically an easier read than other of Conrad's sea works, but is just as deep. A must read."
negative,"Not what I expected at all!!: I puchased this product and was not happy with it at all!It is very sturdy and all that but after awhile using it - the handle is too heavy - which tends to put a strain on your wrist - i have long hair, straight hair and feel it for those who have this product and have curly, long hair - take it from me - if you insist of purchasing this product - get a wrist guard - cause after awhile you will feel the 'burn'.Hope this helps... I can surely say - i wasted my $$$$P.S. i would like to add - it last only 1 yr - used only 7 times out of that one year.."
positive,"Chandler joins the ranks of America's elite authors: The addition of this title and its companion volume, ""Later Novels & Other Writings,"" to the venerable Library of America series makes official what mystery fans have always known: Raymond Chandler is one of the gods of American literature. Following the trail blazed by Dashiell Hammett, Chandler created Philip Marlowe and the set the standard against which all private detective fiction is measured. This two-volume set covers almost the full canon of Chandler's work from early pulp stories to all the Marlowe novels, the screenplay for ""Double Indemnity,"" and essays on the mystery genre plus the usual Library of America goodies such as notes on the text and a chronology of the author's life. In terms of literary inventions, the Wild West cowboy and the hard-boiled PI are this country's only true native sons, and, as such, are deserving of resepct. One of them at least now has it.--Michael Roger"
positive,Must reading: An early environmentalist even before the term came into use. Ranks up there with Sand County Almanac and Silent Spring. A must read for those who care about the environment. Abbey predicted some of the water problems that now face the southwest.
positive,Just what I needed at the office: I wanted to cut down on the amount of coffee I drank and realized one of the main reasons why I top-off is because it cooled down. Once I got my mug warmer I can now happily sip my cup of coffee throughout the day and it keeps it at just the right temperature. Not blazingly hot but just under that. I've been using it 5 days a week 10 hours a day for 2 months and it has been a solid performer.
negative,"Good scanner - poor software: Don't buy this scanner, if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document. The ""SCANDIRECT"" software that ships with this product WILL NOT scan multiple pages into one document. When you feed 5 pages into the ADF (automatic document feeder) thinking you'll get one document with 5 pages ---WRONG.. you get 5 documents with one page each.Just UPGRADE your paperport software for a minimum of $100, and then you can use the scanner as it was designed. When I called to complain to XEROX about this, I was told that they had ""mated"" this scanner and the software (Version 9) before the ADF was added as part of the base scanner. Seemed pretty crappy to me. IT GOING BACK to the store tomorrow."
negative,"Stick it in your ear!: I own one of the Jawbone torture devices. I had an old Jabra with the mini ear gels and just for giggles swapped out the hard plastic stock Jawbone things with them. It was an amazing difference. The Minis fit very well and direct the sound into your ear channel. Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]"
negative,"Not correct product.: The product information was for The Hobbit VHS, when I received the item it was on DVD. It was for a birthday present and it's not even the correct item."
positive,my son's favorite and MORE: This was my son's favorite book for many years. He now reads it to our grandchildren - his neices! We run a full-blown preschool with an average of 110 children each year and I read it to each class every year and they all LOVE it. I lost our copy at the preschool and NEED another one so I'm buying a second one. WE LOVE THIS BOOK!
negative,"Not for Boiling Liquids?????????: I contacted Anchor Hocking and they said that they do not recommend liquids over 160 F degrees to be placed in these mugs. Other reviews seem to imply that people do put boiling liquids in the mugs, but the company does not seem to sanction this use.I have had glass mugs crack on me before because I was not as careful as I should have been in reading the advertised claims, so I am now very carefull. I passed on this product, although they certainly do look beautiful."
negative,"Don't get this radio.: I own and use the best radios on the market. I have and use the Tivoli Model One, Tivoli PAL, and Boston Acoustics Recepter among others, and all the ones I just listed sound much better than the Bose Wave Radio, PLUS they are much cheaper too!There is also one called a Cambridge model 88 that is better than the Bose Wave Radio as well.When you are comparing these radios side by side, the first one you turn off and throw aside is the Bose Wave Radio, it is that bad when compared to the rest.If you want a good sounding table radio, I would suggest the Tivoli Model One instead. If you want a good clock radio for the nightstand, then I would suggest the Boston Recepter. Both are available through Amazon.comI don't work for any of these companies, but I have bought all of the radios exept for the Bose Wave Radio, I borrowed one for a day and had no interest in buying one. Even if it was cheaper, and smaller, but it sounded the same as it does now, I still would not buy it."
negative,"Free Kindle Edition is missing a significant portion of Chapter 20.: The book itself is excellent. Thomas Hardy was a master writer, and look no further than the fact that he makes a story about a person that buys and sells corn interesting. But, the kindle edition is, like the title of the review says, missing a chunk of the text. There might be other parts omitted, but that's the only one I've caught.Perhaps this is evidence that you get what you pay for."
negative,"Sadly disappointing Shelters of Stone: This book was a great let down. If you have read the 2nd - 4th books in the series then there is no need to purchase this one. I don't know what happend but Ms. Auel just regurgitated those books through out most of this book. It was sad that the story line which was hinted at in the last book is not fully explored in this book. What a waste of money, check it out of the library before you decide to spend some cold hard cash."
negative,"Boring: Sea & Cake are critically acclaimed and have made some decent jazz pop in the past, but there is only one good song on this album, and ""Afternoon Speaker"" is it. It even gets a bit monotonous, but at least it's perky and interesting. Pretty much everything else on there puts me to sleep."
negative,"Outdated book: Don't bother with this book....The info is not up-to-date. I bought it used and cheap, and it still wasn't worth it."
negative,"The Bad and the Brainless: Loved Vin in Pitch Black, he was pretty good in Fast and Furious too ... but this movie?Ths acting is flat, the stunts make no sense (jumping a motorcylcle over a 20 foot fence with no ramp? I guess I missed the part where he put ET on his handlebars) and there is not much of a story to speak of ..."
negative,"not worthy to be a chick flick: First, this movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the book except for the title. That said, once again Diane Lane plays someone who is supposed to be sympathetic as if she's a sociopath. Really - when she looks serious, you think she's about to kill someone. When she's happy she looks like she just did. Then you have the fact that nothing that happens in the movie is realistic at all -- except, if someone like Cameron Diaz were in the title role, we'd probably not care and even enjoy it. I feel used and cheap after being duped into watching this movie and I'm no longer going to waste my time on DL's films. She doesn't deliver. If she plays a Black Widow, I'll watch. If she plays another sensitive caring woman, I'll hurl first."
positive,"Midwestern Classic: The three books in this series are a classic Midwestern epic. This is an telling saga for anyone with a desire for insight into how the Midwest was made. I feel like I understand many of the people in my family (with Midwestern roots) better after reading these books. Of course, it is not the final word on the begining of the Midwest, but is a significant part of the tale of the Midwest also told by Laura Ingalls Wilder, Booth Tarkington, Glenway Wescott, Sterling North, Willa Cather, etc.But even if you don't care how the Midwest came to be, the story of the dreams, struggles, hopes, confrontations of very real human beings will keep you engaged.I was very happy to found these and they delighted me thoroughly as I read them.Though ""Giants in the Earth"" stands perfectly on its own, I can hardly imagine stopping there. Read all three for some great entertainment and enlightenment."
positive,"The ideas are more important than the literature: This by now legendary work gave us the concepts doublespeak, thoughtcrime and Big Brother. It is the most important fictional work envisioning a totalitarian future, and warning against it. At the same time it is not a very convincing or moving fiction. Orwell had a one- dimensional quality in his creation of character, and it is very difficult to identify closely with or feel deeply about his characters in this work.Yet now that '1984' has come and gone without the disaster Orwell predicted it still holds our attention as one possible nightmare human future. As importantly it makes its own forceful statement against the kind of controlled, closed- minded world the Soviets, the Nazis, and now the Islamic Radical Fundamentalists would have us be imprisoned in."
negative,"Broke after 4 months of very mild use: Unfortunately, this sharpener stopped working after 4 months of very mild use (essentially for homework of 2 elementary school age kids). It seems to overheat, but doesn't have an auto shut-off, so it finally stopped working altogether. We also weren't happy with how it sharpens the pencils, as they sometimes came out lopsided, and the sharpening tip is way too long (it really wastes pencils this way, which matters when you have nice colored pencils)."
negative,Defective Purchase: The tweezer heads didn't align and couldn't grip anything. Will probably think twice about buying tweezers before I can make sure they close correctly.
positive,"Simply Irresistable: Lauryn has a unique style that sets her apart from the rest. Every song in this CD will do all of the following: 1)make your foot bounce to the beat 2)make you thing deeply about the lyrics 3)make you find yourself recognizing the sheer emotion coming form her vocal chords 4)make you want to dance 5) make your foot bounce. It's originality in itself makes it worthy of praise, but it's practically just brings it on home. This is a MUST for any hardcore hip-hop fans."
positive,"Great Product!: I practically live in these, and I have 5 pairs. The zipper is a little weak; the pull tab can break off, and button can pop off if you're too fat for the size you're wearing. 1 pair should last 2-4 years."
negative,"Stay Away: My recommendation for this book: stay away. My 12 year old son is a huge fantasy fan, so I bought this for him after hearing all the hype. He gave it back to me after reading about 100 pages and asked if it was too late to return it for our money back. I figured it couldn't be that bad, so I began reading iti myself. It is. This book is simply poorly written, horribly derivative of quite a few other fantasy titles (I used to read a lot of fantasy to my son when he was younger), and simply not a very good story. I'm glad so many other people seem to like it (although I'm stumped as to what they see in it). I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone however."
negative,Book has still not been received.: I ordered the book on 06 December 2008 and today is 14 January 2009 and has still not received the book. I have sent three emails to the seller without any response. This is frustration especially when my class has already started.
negative,WHAT KIND OF HUMAN WOULD ENJOY THIS BOOK?: This book was a monumentous waste of anyones time. It could've been possibly the worst book i've ever read. This book is supposed to be for kids? The kids themselves could of written a better story than this piece of junk! Take my advice- save a tree and ditch this terrible book!
positive,"Happy with DVD: I purchased Gaslight as I am presently buying my all time favourite movies. The older movies far surpass most of the new movies made these days. Gaslight was gripping and entertaining from the beginning. Well acted by these legends of film. The picture and sound quality was great, clear and precise."
negative,"wrong amp rating on website: The Fluke current clamp works properly but the Amazon website listed the device as having 1000amp capacity. Actual specification is only 400 amps. Since I'm monitoring an 800 amp, AC service it's not too helpful. Please fix the website. Product description as of 05/06/12 says 1000amp AC/DC.In the technical details it would be very, very helpful if you would attach pdf's of the manuals and spec sheets."
positive,"Great wireless hookup.: I have a desktop that is not wireless and a laptop that is. With this adapter and a wireless gateway, I now have two computers that are wireless. It does what it is supposed to! The only drawback is the cradle that is supposed to hold the actual adapter. The plastic is flimsy and too short causing the adapter to tip it over or fall out of it; in addition, the velcro tape that is supposed to hold the cradle in place with the adapter in it is too small and cannot do the job. The adapter is too top heavy and pulls the plastic cradle down no matter where it is located (I even added extra Scotch tape). The cord of the adapter, which is now plugged into the front USB port of my desktop CPR, now dangles rakishly over the top and down the side of it. Next time, I'll get one without a cord. But it works great!!"
positive,"Looking Certain Death In the Face.: Without this clash, who knows how the war would have gone.Brave Pilots follow their leaders into sacrifice. American Sammuri!Midway is like all battles, they are won by which side does not make the most mistakes."
negative,"Terribly boring: Even though I enjoyed most of the previous books in the series and looked forward to reading this one, I found it was not only a terrible book, but a boring one.Repetitive, uneventful, heavy, unpleansant to read, etc. etc. Nothing justifies reading hundreds of pages to sumerize it in only a few words. Ayla and Jondalar ger married, Ayla has a baby, Ayla proves (yet again) that she has wisdom and 'powers', end of story.I feel cheated and fear the publication of the next one in the series."
positive,"It's The Hobbit Stupid!!!: Well, is this better than any other trade paperback version of The Hobbit? I dunno. But this is THE HOBBIT. I have read it about a billion times to my kids and I CANNOT WAIT for the movie version this month!"
positive,"Very good: I've been around a while and sometimes certain hardcore bands can seem a bit distant for me to relate to. This band however, is not the case. Good, fast, packed with emotion hardcore. Get all the Champion stuff. It's worth it."
negative,"Volume changes, two tapes not understandable: I was hoping to introduce my teens to Jules Verne while traveling; so, I ordered the audio cassettes. However, on most of the tapes, the volume would suddenly go down to be almost inaudible. The quality of two of the cassettes was so bad that only about 1/4 of the tape could be understood."
positive,"this game has it all: though the series nba street never seems to change, the game it self is real fun. it comes packed with features such as just a regular game of street ball. There is also a story mode which you also unlock stages for the regular game of street ball. you can create your own character and choose his stats too. something strange, not in a bad way, but you can do tricks like handstands and more. there are many teams and players to choose from such as kobe bryant. this includes mini-games such as arcade shootout and shot blocker. It also has a really cool music track variety and a sports announcer too. It really is a good game and it will keep you entertained for hours. Its an A++++++++++++ i RECOMMEND THIS!"
positive,"Different But Still Scary!: I seen this movie with my husband in 1982 in the theatre and Ithought it was good and scary then, and I still think it's agood and scary movie. It doesn't have anything to do with thefirst 2 Halloween movies, but it was really good. The music isgood, and the very beginning of the movie when a man gets hisforehead ripped out, that's a scene I never forgot! I thoughtit had a good, surprising ending, also. I recommend it."
negative,"Interesting methodology, Uninteresting result: As others have commented, the dreary humdrum of ""Last Days"" feels more authentic (and sad) than a typical Hollywood rendering of the same. I suppose there is art in the sheer guts to make a portrayal so bleak, so real. But having said that, to want to invest 90 minutes of one's time in such a story, one has to actually care about the protagonists. In this case, there isn't any set-up, no reason to care. In fact, I found myself actively disliking, even loathing the characters (all of them). When the end came, I just didn't care anymore. If this were really what Cobain became like, then his death wasn't a tragedy. It was a blessing.Postscript: it would be nice to see van Sant make a movie that identifies with real human beings rather than the drugged characatures of Last Days or My Own Private Idaho. Those folks . . . just let them die. We don't need them here."
positive,Excellent story: This is early Clancy novel presented in a Larry Bond-type format. This plot involved an entirely different set of characters than the Jack Ryan series. These characters were developed and quite believable. I am disappointed that Mr. Clancy hasn't brought back the Air Force Lieutenant and his Icelandic damsel for a Jack Ryan novel.
negative,"Conventional Wisdom for Morons: This book is simply a compilation of repackaged material that anyone with common sense could write down on a piece of paper. The anecdotes are hokey and the BOLD ALL CAPS punch lines are simply there to take up space. Save yourself some money by sitting down and taking the time to think of how to package yourself in your job search. Also, Mr. Lucht makes sure that his self promotion is woven throughout the book. The kicker is that the book is simplisticly and exasperatingly written in a kind of folksy style. My advice: find someone that you or one of your friends knows who has changed careers, take them out to lunch and pick their brain."
positive,"Chi Running: Great book, came in on time in pristine condition. Can't be any happier with it. Highly suggest people who run often to purchase this book, very revolutionary way to run so as to slow down the process of damaging our bodies while running."
positive,I`m a goofy goober: It`s hillarous and it`s got great music.I saw it 3 times and i want to see it again.
positive,"Great Story: This is an excellent book. I love the classics and had somehow managed to have never read this one until last year. Amazingly, it feels like a story upon a story upon a story. It has the beautiful quality of building anticipation from beginning to end and continuing the story when you are afraid it is about to end! More recent books always leave you with the feeling that you want to know what will happen next when the book has ended, this story gives you everything you could ever want and more beyond your imagination. I highly recommend it!"
negative,"Very boring!: I thought this was supposed to be an autobiography! All he talks about is his school. He mentions his wife and kids only once or twice. I got the impression that he was a very selfish man. Plus, to top it off, the book was boring!"
negative,something's missing: this one bombs very chopped it assumes a lot from the viewer very little character developing it jumps a lot poor directing and writing sorry the first two were great i tried hard to like it rambo would have been a better choice that night
negative,"Interesting? Yes. Good? Well......: I wanted to like it. Really, I did.It's like somebody took Crowbar, Tool, Cake, Rage Against the Machine and Primus, wadded it all up into one big ball and threw the thing against the wall.This CD has it's moments, but it's as if they're just trying a little too hard to be cool, to be ""left of center"", to be lyrically and musically clever.I don't often regret buying a CD, but I really do regret this purchase. There's better stuff out there in this genre. If you're on the fence, don't spend your dough on this dog. If you act fast, my copy will be on Ebay. Bidding starts at one cent."
positive,"absorb it!: I must admit that I have a fetish for Bjork and PJ Harvey, so I don't claim to be objective. But honestly, this is really a relevant CD for anyone interested in decent mainstream pop music. Bjork can turn her limits (naive vocal technique, an icelandic accent you could cut with a knife) into peculiar qualities. She is unique in her ability to couple unusual harmonic passages with quirk turns of phrase and superb arrangements. This album defies classification -- there's big-band jazz, trip-hop, electronic dance, ""sugarcubes"", trance, soundtrack-like strings, even traces of Abba's notorius pop. This is an album that has not created a genre like ""Dummy"" by Portishead, but is vastly superior to it and many other for its musicality, originality, literary quality and sense of humor. ""Homogenic"" is equally good, but much more tense and influenced by the Bristol scene."
negative,"Murder will out (sell): Wait for the paperback. This book is a rehash of earlier works. It may be interesting to those who don't know much about profiling. However, Mindhunter is a much better book than this recycled effort, which seems to have been written primarily to justify his support of the Ramseys. Regarding the Ramsey case, he presents a few credible scenarios incriminating Paty and/or John, and then immediately dismisses them as ""absurd"". His ego seems to have created quite a blind spot."
negative,Don't waste your money: Usually I feel safe buying Tweezerman brand. These feel like some generic knock off - they don't work well and are super stiff to use. I had to go buy a new pair at the beauty supply!
positive,"Acting, Screenplay, and Setting Make Moonstruck a Classic: ""Moonstruck"" is one of the best movies of the past 20 years. The plot is corny, but superb writing makes it seem natural and enjoyable. Excellent acting by Nicholas Cage, Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, and Cher (believe it or not). Filmed in some very picturesque NYC locations. It all adds up to a movie you can enjoy more than once."
negative,"please check out the original!!: Cukor's film is a remake of a very fine UK original starring Anton Walbrook and directed in 1940 by Thorold Dickinson. The American release title was Angel Street. When MGM purchased the movie it was supposed that all negatives and prints were destroyed. Happily a print was rediscovered in the studio vaults. You can decide for yourself which version you prefer. There are some terrific performances in the British film, and brilliant directorial flourishes. Walbrook's particularly good as the cold-blooded husband pushing his frail wife (Diana Winyard) over the edge. Great atmosphere, wonderful supporting cast Enjoy!"
negative,"Sorry: I wanted to like this book but just couldn't. It was close but too slow, too predicatable and certainly no thriller. Somewhat interesting twist on the ""secret"" but not enough to recommend it as a must read."
positive,GREAT PRODUCT: Finally try Gillette Fusion was using Mach3 Turbo. This is much better if you have senitive skin. Less chance of cutting yourself while shaving. Also face feels better after shaving. Worth payng more for.
positive,"Delivers what it promises.: Mr. Erwin's book delivers what the title promises, ""Creative Projects."" From cool ideas for the kids like a giraffe or the ""Tickle me Lego"" toy, to fun things for adults like ""Machine with Minifig,"" there is something for everyone here.PROS: Plenty of project ideas for all levels of builders. Tips for building and programming. Ideas are open-ended to allow plenty of do-it-yourself experimentation. I especially liked the internet resources listed in the back.CONS:Projects are not laid out in step-by-step detail in the book. (They are on the CD-ROM)."
negative,Didn't work: I purchased this tivo from amazon. After hooking everything up I plugged it in and it did not work. No lights or sounds at all. I called tivo's customer service line and they said it would need to be exchanged. I will now have to pay $20-25 for shipping plus packaging materials to send it back and then wait a few weeks for a new one.
negative,"how to TRANSFORM a good movie into a bad one: I was really looking forward in seeing this movie. I have just started to get into the ""ANIME"" thing and have seen some good movies but this movie really stinks. Maybe I was expecting too much from it, but I dont think so. I have seen some [bad] movies in my time and this one ranks within the top 10. Dont waste your time on this, go outside and watch the grass grow instead...it will be more entertaining that watching this piece of trash."
negative,"Disappointed: Made for kindle fire,however words too small to read and they don't blow up like other children's books. I do not recommend"
positive,"The Only American Idol worth listening to: This album will not disappoint. I am not a big fan of Clay Aiken but I ended up enjoying the album; you will never hear more beautiful songs as softly sung by him. He sings in a voice that is smooth, mature- and he can really soar when he wants. This is a great ""feel good""album!"
positive,"Interesting Book: The author of this book has a definite perspective regarding religion and while I don't agree with his view 100%, I still found his writing to be very interesting and enjoyable. I learned things I definately didn't know prior to reading this book. It opened my eyes on a number of world issues and specific US occurences. This is a book worth reading. Great overview of the subject (NWO, CFR, TC, Bilderbergers, etc.)."
negative,"High Pitched Noise: I read reviews of this product before I bought it that mentioned that it makes a high pitched sound. I figured these reviewers probably had defective adapters. However, mine also makes a high pitched sound. It doesn't do it all the time, but I worry that as it gets older, the sound will get worse. Although it charges my computer fine, if I could do it over again, I might pay the extra money and get a different brand...unless you don't mind high pitched noises."
negative,"Disappointed: The towels are as soft as advertised, but that's it. The towels are much smaller than advertised. I ordered grey, but received tan. I can't use them with my grey bathroom!"
negative,"The CD is ok: t.a.t.u is in fact the biggerst gimmick of all the time. (what there name stands for............the kissing.........the taking off of clothes.............and so on and so forth. This album is ok if you take it for what it is: a gimmicky duo of russian females who can't sing and have no real talent but have just enough voice so it can be doctored up with pro tools and placed of pop-like dance beats. If you take the album for what it is its ok but it is in no way new, different, rock or alterative and is not ""the best album ever"" like some reviewers have posted."
positive,"Outstanding Season: The third season was definitely a season for change! If you are truly a NCIS fan, don't miss this season! Everyone is great...and what fun!"
negative,"Fasion, Fops, Faux Pas: I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book is more like the cliff notes to a book about men's fashion, tradition, style, etc. The other half of the book is relatively useless - unless, of course, you're a millionaire & world traveller. The prose is humorous at times becasue it's so pretentious - bordering on the effeminate a la Niles Crane. Still, there are some very imporatnt basice male fashion rules established by history and tradition, discussed in this book, which one wishes were adhered to more regularly. The first half of the book is serviceable, but not authoritative. Flusser comes off somewhat foppish and the picture of him on the dustjacket would lead me to question his taste in, if nothing else, haircuts! I would consider a better book, with far more lavish detail and illustrations to be ""Gentlemen : A Timeless Fashion"", only recently published."
positive,"Ignored master: It is our good fortune this collection exists to showcase the tragically ignored Payne. His songs have thankfully lived on in other artists' recordings, but his own versions are more than worth hearing and on occasion, revelatory. If you are interested in the music part of country music you will care about Leon Payne."
negative,"Disappointed - sorry: I went mad for this guy during the American Idol trials! Sat down and watched and cheered each week; all excited when the album came out and more importantly arrived in Ireland! But when I listened to it; he didn't sound at all like he did in American Idol.I think his song choices on this album left a lot to be desired. Where were all the brilliant songs he sang on the American Idol show? That's what I wanted to hear, that's what I would WANT to hear if I went to see him live in concert.But other than that, I wish him well and hope he takes note of this!"
negative,"A Joke: One reviewer called it the best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made. Well, to me, it's the worst ever made. Only the cinematography and the settings are worth a nod. The foreign accents are amateurishly inept and Holmes, never mind the stature of Nicol Williams, is quite miscast. Storyline and much of the dialogue are idiotic and aimed at a very low viewer intelligence"
negative,"disappointed: Xantrex is a leader in the inverter field so I was very surprised when this product failed almost immediately. I returned it to Amazon for a prompt refund and bought one from Jensen, which has worked perfectly."
negative,"very basic self talk: This CD was really only an overview of self talk, and didn't provide any real self talk, like a Shad Helmstetter or other more well known writer."
positive,"Dorky, fun entertainment: Is the movie great? No, not if you are a die hard Mario Brothers fan who grew up with it in the 80's. Or isn't it? I saw this as a kid and was bummed by how not like the game it was. As an adult however, I've gotta say I have a new found love for this movie. As a re-imagining it's not bad, it's creative, and dammit, Dennis Hopper was epic in whatever he did! And, at both ages I loved that *SPOILER* Luigi gets the girl! (I always thought he got the shaft in the game. :) ) Check it out if you want, but I promise it can be a fun time."
positive,My review: I like this book very much.It is very good and I recommend it to everyone who is a Lord of the Rings fan. It tells the story of how Bilbo found the ring.and first met Gollum
negative,"BEWARE OF THE 5 STARS...IT'S NOT FROM TRUE USERS!: Biotutor is a rip off. I can tell you that Amazon.com keeps removing my post because the company that produces this piece of junk asks them to remove it. The truth is that the people who rate these product 5 stars are not actual users. I PROMISE YOU, when you use this product you would never rate this product 5 stars and you would be so disappointed with this software. It's a very cheap looking software, the pictures and labels in the software are horrible almost like they came of a test book from the early 20's. They should be selling this at a bargain store for $1.00, even charging that amount I'm not sure it's worth it.I'm not going to spend a lot of time typing something that might be deleted. But just to tell you plain and simple, this program is pure junk. A rip off."
positive,"A Wonderful Album full of Classics: I really enjoyed this album. The songs were familiar, but reinterpreted...something you can always rely on Bridgewater to do. It's rare to hear a vocalist of this caliber."
negative,"Annyoying 5 year olds movie.: This is the typical American family movie that I love to hate. The Little family walked around wearing big cheesy grins, to a point where I wanted to punch the smiles off with my fist. Stuart is WAY too cute for my liking. The only time I was amused was when Stuart got stuck in the washing machine (unfortunatley, Mrs. Little got him out).Thank goodness this movie only went for an hour and a half. Any longer and I would've gone insane."
positive,"classic: I read this after watching the Disney film and was not disappointed. Enjoyed it immensely a novel well ahead of it's time and gives the reader an even broader perspective of the main character ""John Carter""Having never read ""Edgar Rice Burroughs"" I never knew what I was missing. ""SUPERB!"""
positive,"Second 510 purchased in two years; both are excellent: I bought my first Xerox DocuMate 510 in mid-2008. It works so well that when I wanted to replace an aging scanner for another office machine, I simply bought it again. I am running Win XP (paid extra not to get VISTA when I bought new machines) and find this scanner, combined with PaperPort 11, works beautifully. I do not use the ""single touch"" software that comes with it, having long since learned to use PaperPort for all scanning, so I cannot comment on its functionality. The machine itself does everything it saws, without error."
negative,"Blackberry C-X2 Battery: The battery did not work at all. It had a slight bubble hump on the pack. It was unfortunate because I needed it before a trip I was taking. However, I was able to get another one from the third party that sent it and then returned the bad one back a day before I had to leave."
negative,"Low quality DVD: I enjoyed the movie but, the movie kept freezing up on me. I used two different media sources to view the movie. Not very good quality. I've never had a new movie freeze up like this one did. I will not use this buyer for any future purchases.Very disappointed!"
positive,Death at a funeral: I love this movie & would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat! British comedy at its best!
positive,The Best Documentary Ever Made: You take a band like Rush and show archival footage and pictures from their beginnings and you have the Greatest Rock Documentary Ever made !
positive,"Wow: I've always believed that great art is a piece where looking at it in awe, you say to yourself ""How could this be done by human hands?"" Dune is just that."
negative,"no effort: Nintendo have put absolutly no effort into this game, they've just taken an old classic and thrown it in a gameboy cartridge. The worst problem is that there is no save, there are 100 levels and you can't even save! So you've got to sit down and play for 5 hours in order to finish the game. At first the game is really fun with all the old moves and characters but it so ... repetetive it's not funny. With the exeption of a few buildings all the levels are pretty much the same for 100 levels. What a shame this could have been really good. ( for all those who complained about there not being a 2-player option, here is a code so that you can with the use of a link cable:- at the options menu hold select and press the control pad UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP. )"
positive,"Disturbing...: One of the signs of a great book, in my opinion, is that it disturbs you - twists with your emotions and never leaves you. More importantly, that it makes you think.Farenheit 451 does this and more. As I read it, it horrified me how much it applies to today's society. People are always offended about one thing, or they want you to delete that. Some people detest reading at all and are content to spend their days watching sitcoms - most of which are not funny and have no point to them whatsoever. These days, people seem to be longing for an easy, brainless, sacchrine happiness and existence. Farenheit 451 shows what happens when those people get their wish.A must-read for anybody of any age - five stars from me! If you like it, and haven't already read other books of this genre (dystopias and such) - may I also recommend 1984 by George Orwell, Anthem by Ayn Rand, and The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood."
negative,"POOR EXCUSE FOR A RELEASE OF THIS TOUR: I mean, c'mon. The Stones and fans talk about how important the 1969 tour was, new guitar player, new live sound, new quiet audience. They were right, sure. But the 1989-90 tour was far more important. They basically got up and played song after song they never played before or at least not in many years. They never sounded that good live. They never stayed in tune thru the whole show before. Sympathy/Devil with the piano and congas just like the studio version. Where's all the songs from these shows???? Where's Undercover, 2000 Light Years From Home, Salt of the Earth? At least they included Factory Girl, good move. I'm glad I taped the Atlantic City show off the air. Much better than this....."
positive,"Fun to Watch: This movie clearly shows that the cast and the director didn't take the movie seriously. But that's okay because Tremors is fun to watch, hilarious in some scenes, and not too much blood and gore to make it just like a horror flick. All the actors played their parts very well and the plot is good enough for a movie like this. In fact, my major dissapointment is that the monsters don't look anything like the thing on the cover.All,in all, a great video to watch when trying to relax or having a party."
positive,"This was an Awesome movie!!!!: This movie was Awesome!! The special fx were great, the acting was great and I didn't think it was cheezy at all! I was reading the other reviews with only one star and I was thinking to mysef *these people are stupid* This is a must see!"
negative,horrible cover: Well RATM is an awesome band and are really hard to cover. I give them that. But my god if your going to cover them please make it better than this. this cd is a HUGE disapointment.
positive,Great Shoes!: I loved these shoes when I got them. They Rock. The company Dress Code is great also they were really good to me when I received my shoes unfortunately they didn't fit so I had to return them for a pair one size bigger. Anyway I didn't have the money at that time to send them back right away so I told them I would send them back as soon as I got paid and to my surprise a few days later I received a prepaid return label from them it was great. Now I am able to send them back right away I am very happy with everything.
positive,"Improvement from previous Sims games: A humorous edge, great locations to visit, and a better story mode. Improved graphics from the previous Sims games for PS2. Awesome direct control/godmode toggle. More interactive objects through third person mode (and cooking, socializing, etc) Not bad in general.Some issues: AI still seriously lacking. Doors getting blocked so sims refuse to move or walk through. Sims taking the longest possible distance to walk to an object. Often difficult to simply interact with other sims. Minor problems in interface such as having to pause the game and scroll through a bunch of sims to figure out what their relationships are. Pausing the game every time you need to know which skill to improve to advance in your career. Could have made it a little more user-friendly.Overall, a lot of improvement and depth added. Recommended if you are a Sims fan."
positive,"Escape to the past and come to the present: A great history / love story DVD in IMAX, I especially liked the Phil Jones special feature that teaches about the Didgeridoo and Australia.Also some cool folk stories about Emus andnew slant on how the world was created."
negative,"Do I have to give it a star?: Even that single star is more than this book is worth. My Engligh professor assigned this book to me during my sophomore year of college (along with Nectar in a Sieve, a far better, though not terrific book), and what little I remember of it was that it was just awful (and offal). Her writing is repetitive and choppy, perhaps descriptive but disgustingly so. Do we really need to know the ""wetness between [her] legs"", or that she cooked her menstrual fluid into some poor soul's dinner? I couldn't stand the book. If you want quality, read something by Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King (his descriptions of a girl coming of age in Carrie are much better than this book). Drop the book, throw it, burn it, whatever. It's just not worth reading. How many trees did we lose to its production (and, more importantly, how many talented young writers were rejected because this woman was published). It's just a book not worth reading about a story not worth telling."
negative,"not bad, not great: Alas, having been steeped in Tolkien and CS Lewis, I have extremely high standards. This book is not bad, and kudos for the author being so young, but I was not personally thrilled. I shall read the sequel but I went ahead and gave ""Eregon"" away."
positive,"Product Availability: I was delighted to find the exact frying pan I was looking for, but couldn't find in the stores. All the Farberware products in stores are covered with teflon or are treated in some other way. Thank heavens they're still making the product I remember, and thank you Amazon, for carrying it!"
positive,Excellent Book: I read this book for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock. Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul. This book does much more than that. It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy. He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly. He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone.
negative,"Good book, kindle edition filled with typos: I guess somebody scanned a paper version of this book to build the kindle edition, as it appears to be filled with OCR errors.The content of the writing is enjoyable, but the kindle-edition typos are a real buzzkill for getting into the book.Get it in paperback, skip the kindle edition."
negative,"Crashes before it sails: 2 1/2Atmosphere defeats substance in middling late seventies fusion, which at best evokes a mild Miles."
positive,"The most awesome game I've ever seen!: This thing is eeriely accurate. The whole family loves this thing. It's inexpensive & it's hour of fun! It's right most of the time, but when it's wrong, it's fun to see the answers, many of which are really close. It guessed manatee & seal when I was thinking dolphin. Or vollyball when I was thinking football, & fish tank & hot tub when I thought swimming pool.This is well worth the money, very impressive. I will likely pick up a few more for friends & family."
positive,I LOVE THIS CD !!!!: Michael puts so much passion and feeling into everything he sings.This CD really high lights his great talent and range. He cansing a song that you've heard others sing but when he sings it heputs so much power and feeling into it that it sounds like a brand newsong. I listen to this CD everyday because it is so relaxing &I love all the songs on it. One of my favorites is BRING HIM HOME. I have just about all of his CD's but I think this is my favorite. I think he is probably one of if not the best singertoday. He can sing any kind of music & make it sound wonderful.
positive,"A favorite movie: While I love the movie, this is the first DVD I have bought from Amazon that won't play on my multizone DVD (region O) player. But it will play on the laptop, so not a complete loss."
negative,"Lord of the Flies: We've just recently read this book at my middle school some of my classmates and I found this book to be unappealing. I thought it was actually a boring book even considering all of the violence. In my opinion, Golding picked a subject for each chapter and dwelt on it. I thought that this was a slow-moving book. Also the way he wrote things was kind of ""beating around the bush."" So my advice to you is if you do not have to read this book, don't."
positive,"If fantasy is your genre of choice, then READ THIS BOOK!: Continues, and builds upon the promise of her first bookin this duology, 'Hunter's oath, definitely a solid read. Ifgood characterization, real depth of writing and 'pick youup and take you along' writing are what you look for in afantasy novel- then look no further.An easy read, but not amass market feather-weight, she gives a solid experience forthe money. Names like Tad Williams, C.J.Cherryh, K.K. Rusch andP. Volsky would be on the same shelf if books were filed bya quality plus quantity conscious (but alphabeticallychallenged) librarian."
positive,"LaoTzu for kids: This book, is a book I love to read to my children. It conveys in simple words children can understand, the wisdom of the Tao Teh Ching. It inspires children to be happy through actions based on their own instinct and conscience, rather than absolute direction or authority from others."
negative,"Book's OK, but....: The Red Limit is another of Timothy's Ferris excellent distilliations of astrophysics for public consumption. As usual, he is skilled not only in making science concepts comprehensible but bringing into vivid detail the *story* of science -- how we know what we know. It even includes the occasional philosophical discussion.So why the low rating? Because this book is twenty years old. I had assumed that the reprint would maybe have some updated material, but it doesn't. This is effectively a book on the State of Cosmology circa 1983.Don't waste your money on this. Ferris's own Whole Shebang is better written and more up to date. You might also check out Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, which is a very similar book but far better and has been updatee for the most recent discoveries. Bill Bryson's Brief History of Nearly Everything only covers cosmology in basic detail, but is also far more up-to-date."
positive,Intriuging: This book had so many hidden features that it was impossible to name them all. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't enjoy a good thought though. A few scenes were a lttle morbid and grafic for my taste and those with a weak stomach beware. A great book to do a report on no matter if its a review or an essay. Only make sure you have enough time to read it from start to finish with out stopping.
positive,"LOVE IT!: My co-worker and I bought this is a gift for our boss on Boss's day. He's the only one in the office that drinks coffee and we'd make a whole pot for him on the old coffeemaker only to throw more than half the pot away every day because he didn't drink it all.One of the other attorney's in the office had a Keurig and recommended it to us. The boss LOVES it. He likes that he is able to choose from a variety of coffees, and it makes a perfect cup each and every time. The gift was a hit!"
positive,Complex Love: I have seen all movie versions about Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and still love the book everytime I revisit the story. Every word captivates the reader into truly feeling the passion and tragedy of these two lovers. Even a character such as Tybalt Capulet won me over as far as description goes. Shakespearian writing is very much complex and confusing but it has a touch romance and anger which adds to the emotion of the story. Read this classic tragedy!
negative,"Per favore, this is not music for an Italian wedding reception!: My husband and I spent quite a bit of money buying CDs with Italian Wedding in the title, hoping to make our wedding reception a joyous salute to our mutual Italian American heritage. We spent almost $25 for this CD, which had NOTHING we could really use in our Italian wedding, except for maybe one song during the ceremony in the church (but we had an organist for that) This is NOT a CD for an Italian wedding reception. In a way, the title is deceiving. Amore couple in Tampa"
negative,"You missed the point Tom: This book does an admirable job of describing the great accomplishments of the WW2 generation. Many people with little preparation became heroes or millionaires. But to call them the 'Greatest Generation' totally misses the point on what it takes to make one great. It isn't just great accomplishments, it's having great values - and passing these on to your children so that when you're gone the world is a better place. Look at the children neglected while their mothers work. Look at the skyrocketing national debt. Look at the social security debacle. The 'Greatest Generation' passed all these on to us to solve.Look around Tom... they were a major failure."
positive,"A first-class history of the Israel-Arab conflict: Thousands of books have been written on the Israeli-Arab conflict. Virtually all of these have been partisan. Here we have the first objective history covering the conflict from its 19th century inception right up to the 21st century. ""Righteous Victims"" is not a history of Israel nor a history of Palestine. It is a history of the conflict and it covers the subject comprehensively, objectively and with acute insight. No serious student of the Middle East can afford to ignore this book."
negative,Not Thrilled: I was disappointed with the amount of ON SCREEN displays there were and found it too distracting to even play. After you hit the ball there is a streak that follows the ball. I found this annoying. I ended up taking it off my computer and found a different game that I like MUCH better. I'm glad I didn't pay a whole lot for this. It was disappointing.
negative,Mirror Mirror: I need to know the words in this song so I know what it is like before I buy it. The reason I did rated this CD with one star is because I've never heard it before.
positive,"Better than Play!: Moby, the underground techno icon, put his strongest effort is to everything is Wrong. Hymn starts you with a hint of ambient, almost eclastic beauty. Feeling So Real grabs you after the second or third listen. Moby really streches musically here. Its an odd piece that really grows on you. What Love &First Cool Hive brings us to the forefront of the depth of expresion this man is capable of. He took chances that no other artist of his time would take. With Everything is Wrong, he was finalizing the techno bible so-to-speak. We end with Into the Blue- a fantastic piece that leaves you hanging in his grooves. In 1995, Moby was awesome but most folks did not see it. Then the off beat strang attempt with Animal Rights, which even now distance himself from. If you REALLY want to know Moby, this record is a must! Beautiful spin!"
positive,"A Workhorse: This is the third of these pans I have purchased. I use this big pan every day, so after two or three years, I need to replace. The size with the straight sides gives you a huge cooking surface. I would definitely recommend this for family cooking."
negative,"Regurtitating her visit to our company: I worked for one of the companies analyzed (and praised) in her book. She spent a few days with us, and we presented our Web strategies, which were not very strong at the time. She presented material from her Customers.com book (which I enjoyed more than this book). And then she pointed out many problems with our Web strategies (many of which we knew...but being a large company, we were having difficulty changing). Imagine my surprise when I listened to this book and heard her praise our company. She should be in PR...she made us sound a lot better than we were!"
negative,"Review of Chi Running: I thought this book was pretty much a waste of time. A good friend of mine who is a practitioner of Chinese medicine recommended the book to me because he knows I'm a runner. He told me a little bit of what the book talks about before I bought it. Honestly, I got more out of that conversation about the book than I got out of the book itself. Turns out, I already practice ""chi-running."" The basic idea is to be aware of your breathing and your body while you run and work on having good form. Yeah, thanks, I learned that in high school cross country, except without the unnecessary baggage of eastern philosophy that Dreyer packages with the obvious running advice he gives."
negative,"Just ok: The information is ok. However, I feel like I am watching an episode of Family Guy when they stretch a joke way past the funny part. She is trying so hard to be funny that she ruins the purpose of the video. I really wanted to learn from the video but the dumb jokes and Sheri trying so hard to make it funny just makes it tough to watch."
negative,Live CD With Gaps Between Songs: At the the end of each song the sound fades out and there is a gap and then the sound fades in. For a live CD this is frustrating. The sound level is not the greatest either. I should have gone with the highlights CD.
positive,Is it so hardcore: Kids is a film that has been misunderstood since its release parents say that it is a kiddy porn film and that it makes no sense or that it does not have a proper ending. Children and teenagers however watch it and think that it is great because every one smokes drinks and has underage sex basically three things that are garuanteed to evoke a positive response from the underage amongst us. The thing about this film however is that it is basically a documentary commenting on the lives of a group of fairly average teenagers because lets face it most kids probably do get up to this kind of thing. If you watch Kids with an open mind you will see a harsh unrelenting look at the truth of the teenage social heierarchy of drink drugs and sex. On the whole a very thrilling film that pulls no punches and gives the topic of aids a new spin that is light years away from tom Hanks in Philadelphia.
negative,"Ah, youth.: Amazing? The best book ever? Incredibble [sic] writing? Ahhh...to be young and stupid again! These youngsters will probably be ashamed to remember their bright-eyed, glowing praise for what is not even a sub-par fantasy knockoff when they get older and discover real fantasy. I read this to my kid. I was ashamed to have finished the book, even in that capacity. He lost interest about 1/2 way through--I lost it much earlier. I guess you can't blame the kids for their poor taste. I listened to the Monkees when I was younger ;-) Consider ""Eragon"" the Monkees of fantasy novels....it looks pretty but their isn't much there when you actually stop and pay attention to it."
negative,"Not Worth It: I bought this b/c my son is not able to sleep unswaddled and he gets tangled up in regular swaddling blankets (scary!). Unfortunately, it was a waste of money. The blanket is not designed to swaddle tightly (which is the point) and my son is 9 lbs, 7 oz (clearly within the 7 - 14 lb range). He got his arms loose and they flailed inside the blanket even after I stitched on additional velcro to make the swaddling tighter. Unless your child doesn't wiggle at all, don't bother with this blanket."
positive,"GET THIS BOOK WHILE ITS STILL IN PRINT: Investigators like John Keel don't seem to exist anymore, so get this book while it's still in print for an honest approach toward unexplained phenemenon. It will probably never be able to compete with the books that assure us we are being visited by ET's, angels/demons and/or ancient deities. People want something to believe in. ""Belief is the enemy"",warns Keel. How many paranormal researchers do you know would say that? We are goldfish in a fishbowl being watched over and toyed with, but by What? This is the question Keel will leave you with and that will keep you staring wide eyed up at the ceiling late at night in bed..."
positive,"Simply one of Disney's Best: This has got to be at least in the top three of the many animated movies the Disney studios produced. So many great characters are in it - Cleo, Jiminy Crickit, The Good Fairy, Gepetto, Honest John, Monstro and of course Pinocchio himself. So many good hummable songs too including ""An Actor's Life"", I've Got No Strings to Hold Me Down, and the most famous ""When You Wish Upon A Star."" The story is original and the plot exciting without being too scary for little ones and all ends happily. Don't miss the ride at Disneyland either!"
negative,Not for me.: Thought it was poorly written. The story was long & boring. Thought I would try her to find new writers. will not buy again.
positive,"My new favorite record: I saw these guys at Coachella last year and not only do they put on an amazing performance, there studio work is nothin short of superb. This is definitely an album you can put on and listen from track 1 until the very end and get into every minute! All my buddies are hooked!"
negative,"Movies on Parade VHS - terrible: This is a wonderful animated movie in its original form. This particular product (the ""Movies on Parade"" VHS version from [...]) is terrible with poor audio and video through-out - very dark and garbled in sections. I missed the other reviews about this specific product and would not have wasted the money on it.I wish that AMAZON would sub-group reviews by actual product (not the movie, but the actual tape or DVD by a particular company) or allow a dual rating system - one for the movie and one for the media product."
positive,"Grows on you, like fungus: I'll admit I haven't been keeping up with Pearl Jam lately. The last album of theirs I bought was the brilliant ""Vitalogy"" nearly six years ago. So I figured I'd see where they're currently heading before treading back to ""No Code"" and ""Yield"". Boy am I glad I did. This album reflects an evolution - there are new directions here - while maintaining consistency. You can hear glimmers of classic PJ (to me, ""classic PJ"" is anything off of ""Ten"" or ""Vs""). And I disagree with some of the other reviewers that the songs aren't ""sticky"". After only 2 days I can't get ""Light Years"" out of my head - I hum it in the office and annoy my co-workers (had the same problem with ""elderlywomanbehindthecounter..."" off ""Vs""). And when ""Insignificance"" comes on, well it's time to crank it up. But the real gem here is Eddie's whimsically dark ""Soon Forget"" - a lesson learned, if nothing else. If you like well-structured rock, with thought-provoking lyics, definately check this one out."
negative,"Not so good: I bought this book a while back but just now got around to reading it. I'm a fan of luna but I wonder what they thought when they were reading this. Its really confusing in the beginning throwing characters in there that dont have much of an explaination since they aren't human. It would have been better for me if there were more details about their society since its other worldly like, to be honest I dont feel anything towards the characters. If one of them died, I'd be like oh well I guess. The main character is double sided, like she wants to still be friends with Severn, yet killing him at the same time?? Its mainly lacking alot of explaination. But I will trudge on and finish it and probably read the others since I already bought them, which I know regret. I had high hopes from the 5 star rating i saw. Just proves to show I need to read the first one before purchasing the books that follow after. Hope this review helps."
negative,"flimsy: poor instructions, had to modify by creating new holes in the metal. The rubber bag clamps were too difucult to remove so replaced with wood clothespins. Don't bother with this thing."
positive,"Great relief from pain!: This item is super fantastic. It is easy to use, and WOW! WOW! WOW!just heat in the microwave and it gives off warm moist heat to make your sore muscles feel better. Loved this so much, I bought a second one and talked about it so much to a friend that I gave the second one to her. This item is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"A forgotten classic of Faulkner: It seems every modernist attempted to write a great work concerning the great war (except fitzgerald, who didnt get to go himself). Faulkner's attempt may be second only to Hemingway's ""A Farwell to Arms."" ""A Fable"" is classic, which won the pulitzer prize,has long been overlooked simply because it represents a change from Faulkner'susual subject matter. In reality though, it may be his second greatest work behind ""the sound and the fury."" THis work is a brillian anti-war novel that looks at wars affects both on soldiers and civilians, and even on religion. A must read for any fan of Faulkner or modernism."
positive,"I went to school with the author: Camika was always serious at ETSU, so to see her actually write a book with humor almost sent me to my grave. I enjoyed the book and it's good to finally see the author relax and live a little. I never thought she'd be an author either. All she ever did that made her smile was play Spades. The book was all that and I'm really just glad to know that I know someone who is taking the bull by the horns and following her dream. Hey Camika, remember that water gun fight with the Omegas and the time we kidnapped the guy we thought was on line for Alpha? Those were the days. I'm a supporter for life! Oo-oop!"
negative,"VERY DISAPPOINTED: I bought this CD for my 3 year old son after seeing the movie and absolutely loving it! We were so disappointed that we immediately returned it and got our money back! The CD only has 3 songs that are actually sung and the rest are all instrumental. My son was so excited to listen to the songs he had heard in the movie, but when they played they (the main song) was sung by a different person and just not the same. I am sorry to say this was not worth putting a CD together for...they should have just left it in the film for everyone to enjoy."
positive,AWESOME BOOK: I would recommend this book to any Lord of the rings fans Bilbo will make this book worth your while!
positive,"It's actually very good...: I find it difficult to believe that there are too many errors strewn throughout the book. Most of the examples are in basic SQL, so some tailoring might be required for it to fit your individual DBMS. Of course, you can always go to the last chapters for practical applications using proprietary software.This leads me to remind the buyer that the book is about concepts and design, not Oracle/MySQL/Java etc etc programming. It teaches you things you might have missed if taught informally, such as database normalization and the use of various keys.For what it claims to be, it suits the job quite well, and is very detailed in how it describes database design and common pitfalls.Again, this is not a dedicated programming book, and only teaches design concepts and standards."
positive,"Concerning Hobbits: First of all, this book is amazing. J.R.R Tolkien was and forever will be one of the greatest authors of all time. The master of detail and one of the leading innovators of fantasy stories, Tolkien has created worlds, languages, and memorable characters that will never be forgotten. This book has some really interesting artwork done by Tolkien himself. A true gem for any LotR or Hobbit fan's collection. Plus it's hardback, which I prefer over paperback any day! A+ Recommend!"
positive,"good stuff: although there is actually only one hit on this CD, if youre from this time the memories are worth it all."
negative,"Trash!: This never should have been made.I mean,what kind of movie kills off children? That is just morally sick.I wouldn't waste a single cent on this piece of garbage."
negative,confusion: This author has a rather confused idea about Celts - an image only entertained by people who know nothing about us and who have never been close to a Celtic country.
positive,"THIS CD IS GREAT!!!: This CD is great!!! Words can't explain how good this album is with a lot of songs that are remade by Mandy Moore. Her first two previous albums were good, but this one is fantastic!"
negative,"This book is an example of a popular delusion...: This was recommended by some famous people as a ""must read"" for serious investors. The people who rant and rave about how great this book is must have only read the inside jacket. There is 160 pages on the Alchymists alone, which like most of the book, could have been summed up in a third of the space. This book is so stretched out it's ridiculous, I'm willing to bet 90% of those who attempt to read it never finish. I'm warning you now, as an avid reader of financial books, this is one of the slowest reads you will ever encounter.......ugh."
positive,"a greater understanding of a sick mind: Nuel Emmons is the author, so these are his words. He only translates into readable print what Charles Manson is trying to relate to us. I have no sympathy for Manson, being where he is, as he is a grown man and is responsible for his own actions. He cannot blame his childhood for the mistakes he made as an adult.However, I do feel sorry for Charles Manson, the child. Growing up, he was totally confused, and I do have sympathy for him at that stage of his life. However, anyone with even a SHRED of common sense, knows you cannot think like the adult Manson and get away with it for long."
negative,"worst pj album: Pearl Jam really dissapointed me with this CD. There's really not any great songs on the album, maybe a few that are listenable, but none worth mentioning. Even if you are a die hard pearl jam fan, dont waste the money on thisn."
negative,"Fans of ""10 Things I Hate About You"" Won't Be Impressed: I knew that this movie wasn't going to be like 10 Things I Hate About You, but it looked really funny. I didn't expect it to be so dumb. I thought it might be as dumb as There's Something About Mary or American Pie, but this movie was really dumb, I mean really dumb. Instead of making smarter from this movie I only grew dumber, much dumber. (...)If I hadn't been I would of enjoyed the movie one bit. Yes it is enjoyable, but just make sure your brain is turned off. If you want a teen movie that will actually get some credit from critics get 10 Things I Hate About You, if you want a movie to watch when you are lazy and bored then watch this. But if your looking for another acceptable teen comedy, you won't find it here."
negative,"For The Old: I have 2 very modern bikes. The frames have oversized downtubes. One frame is aluminum, the other high-end carbon. The bend on this stand (where it hooks around the downtube) does not fit either frame. Would recommend this to someone who rides steel frame bicycles. It is ideal for those that have smaller diameter tubes.For the modern bikes, this product is USELESS."
negative,Disappointing: Brokaw glosses over a very important subject and shows his political colors readily. It is unfortunate that the same subject has not yet been treated by a more serious and professional author.
negative,"Title misleading: I was very disappointed when I received this cd. I thought that it would be a collection of songs that have been on the show. I am a huge fan and was very excited when I found this cd on Amazon. When I received the cd and listened to it, the only song from the show was the main title theme. The cd is actually a collection of songs that ""inspired the show."" Amazon does not state this. It is in small print on the cd cover. HUGE disappointment."
positive,"Makes a Jawbone 2 better: I hated the fit of my Jawbone 2.0. It would never stay in no matter which ear loop or ear bud I used. Someone recommended these to me, so I thought I'd give them a try. After 2 months of using it, I'm pissed I didn't get them sooner. Before chucking your Jawbone 2.0, try these."
positive,Wonderful Ink!: I love this ink! It looks smooth and dries incredibly fast. I would recommend getting it in other colors too!
negative,"Who is this book for? (Other than the author's family): This book was sent to me for review. I honestly don't understand what any child or adult other than the author's family would get from this expensively produced vanity book that has no focus, no story. As a scrapbook for relatives, it's lovely. As a children's book for others, it's dreadful."
negative,"Disappointing: This is one of the rare cases where the movie is better than the book - way better! The rest of the ""1"" reviews will suffice for explanation."
negative,"""Frustration Free"" packaging is anything but: I don't know why Amazon chose to package it using their standard cardboard boxes. I never even received this package, but what I DID receive was several FBI agents knocking on my door wondering why the UPS driver died half way to my house. I thought UPS outfits protected them from this sort of thing? More importantly, I never got my package. Which is a shame, I ordered some nice looking bottled water with it that is apparently from some fresh springs in northern Canada. Guess the UPS people will be drinking THAT, too. Two stars because the bottle looks nice. I might see if the feds will give it to me so I can put some scented candles in there or something. My UPS driver always said to look on the bright side of life, so I guess I will. Rest his soul."
negative,"Was this movie made for the Lifetime channel?: If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them. This movie was not scary. It would have been suspenseful if I cared for any of the characters. You know what the best part was? When it was over.Few movies compel me to write reviews, good or bad. This one obviously did."
positive,no bass: the music is great and the clarity is good but there seem's to be a lack of bass volume on the first half of the disc.it may have been that way on the original and i just don't remember but overall pretty good
negative,Piece of garbage!: I've gone through 3 of these...finally learned my lesson. They haven't lasted a full year! I only sharpen a dozen pencils per week maximum.They just die!
negative,"Ordered 2; Both Chains Were Tarnished and Pendants Scratched!: I have generally had very good experience ordering jewelry from Amazon sellers, so I ordered two of these necklace pendants, one for myself and one for my mother. Both arrived with very badly tarnished chains (about half the chain rust colored on both). In addition, the actual pendants were scratched and ""used looking""."
negative,"PS2 version only a shadow of the PC version: As a true Maxis fan, I was disappointed to say the least when I eventually discovered the PS2 version of ""The Sims 2"" was nothing like the one played on the PC. There are 3 big reasons why I regret purchasing this game:- You cannot become pregnant or adopt.- There are no Genetics, Family trees, etc.- There is no agingThe whole point of ""The Sims 2"" was to develop GENERATIONS of sims and take each sim from a child up to a senior citizen. In this games defense, I will say it did provide hours of entertainment.Honestly, The sims series just is not meant for a console like PS2. The sims series is a PC game, and when transferred to a console you lose so much of what makes the game great.I love almost every game Maxis has ever created, even my least favorite Maxis' games are ranked above some of the more popular PC games.A rare miss for Maxis."
negative,Soupless in San Diego: I love to cook and I love to make soups but basically this book was unimaginative and uninspiring. Also hard to read in the Kindle version.
negative,"Only movie I gave up on!: Having been interested in the story of Joan Of Arc since grade school,I thought I'd give this DVD a try.Good thing I rented it.. I thought the acting,etc, was okay,but the movie totally lost me when,shortly before a siege is to take place,the French ask the English to surrender. Their reply is for the French to quote""Go F**K Yourselves!"",Shortly after the siege takes place,there is an endless round of ""F"" words.I'm sorry.I'm no scholar,but I don't think that,in 1420,that F word was even invented much less used in such a casual manner.. If you make a movie based on history,then keep it in a historical context.(Same problem I had with some of ""Titanic""'s language). I do not recommend this movie to anyone."
negative,"Too thick: I was looking for an everyday body oil but this is too thick for everyday use, but o.k. for massages."
negative,"Nothing special about the special affects: Most of the time you can't tell what you're looking at, everything is so dark and gritty. There are explosions all the time, but I'm not sure why, as nothing seems to get damaged. The Transformers are garbage. Once again, new ones are introduced with no particular reason why I should care, and the movie is quite cavalier about killing fan favorites. The plot is thin (and ridiculous) and has huge plot holes. Bad guys are bad, but the good guys aren't particularly good anymore, as there are a ton of casualties that nobody seems to care about.This movie evoked nothing but a hatred of Michael Bay."
negative,"Started well, then...: turned into a totally different story. I liked the beginning, but closer to the ending i could not believe that was the same book. There were good ideas that were abandoned by the writer, and the characters acted stupid most of the time.I do not reccomend this book."
positive,"FRUSTRATING OMMISIONS: IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS VIDEO COMPILATION AS PERFECT DUE TO A NUMBER OF INCREDIBLE OMMISIONS. ALONG WITH IGNORING THE TELEVISION PERFORMANCES FOR 'STARMAN' AND 'REBEL REBEL', THERE ARE NO VIDEOS BETWEEN THE YEARS 1973 AND 1977, A TIME IN WHICH BOWIE HAD MANY FANTASTIC SINGLES INCLUDING 'FAME', TVC15', 'GOLDEN YEARS' AND 'SOUND AND VISION'. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS A MUST FOR BOWIE FANS. HIGHLIGHTS: 'LIFE ON MARS', BE MY WIFE', BOYS KEEP SWINGING', 'CHINA GIRL' AND THE BEST VIDEO OF THE LOT- 'ASHES TO ASHES'."
positive,Naam or Word: This book explains how the basis of all religions and paths to God have the same origin - the God-into-expression power. It also presents what to look for when seeking the Truth.
negative,"Incorrect Packaging - Twice!!!: Twice I tried to acquire this classic DVD set. And both times received a box set without shrink wrap. And the DVD that should contain the Year Without A Santa Clause stop motion animation turned out to be a feature film with the same title featuring Delta Burke and John Goodman.Twice I was disappointed. And to add insult to injury, the replacement disk set was also missing one of its 4 disks. This was ordered through Amazon, therefore I have no idea whom the vendor was.[...] for this one."
negative,"Heavy, bulky, yet delicate.: I found the thing as heavy as any machine I've ever used, but was pleased, at first, with the pick up, and lack of having to deal with shopping for the appropriate bag replacements. On the third use, however, I ran over a computer cord and when I pulled it out, usually nothing major, the rolling brush stopped rolling, and the sucking action was reduced to almost nothing. This thing is much too heavy and bulky to be so darn delicate. I am currently waiting for a replacement, and will live with my mistake, but certainly wouldn't recommend it, especially for a woman."
positive,"Boy, do we love the Little Critter books!: We have a lot of Little Critter books.They're short, they're funny, they're topical, and they're cheap.As usual, Little Critter's view of events and the actual illustrations don't quite mesh together nicely. This is a source of endless amusement for young children.Good book, one I'd recommend easily."
negative,"SAVE YOUR $: This book promised to be rich in the recently discovered secrets of the prophet Isaiah, a scientific explanation of prayer, and ""A Groundbreaking Interpretation of Prayer, Quantum Science, and Prophecy."" Not!If you break ground with this book do your self a favor - throw it in the hole and cover it up it's not worth the read.If you want to read about someone else's personal adventures and their preceived importance then this book is for you!"
negative,"Cannot recommend - it stains my laptop screen: As a keyboard protector, it works fine.Unfortunately, the material seems to interact with the LCD display to leave marks.It has stained my screen with rectangles (one from each protected keycap).Water does not completely remove the marks on the screen - they appear to bepermanent."
negative,"Movie Butchered!: This DVD of Rankin-Bass's ""The Hobbit"" has picture quality too dark to view, portions missing, parts repeated, cheesy transitions added, overly saturated colors, pixelation, jerky camera panning that I don't see on my VHS copy, and many sound effects missing. The company who did this, Movies on Parade, should be ashamed. I love this film and don't know why they tampered with it so much they made it unwatchable. This butchered version should not be sold or given away! This wonderful feature was ruined by an idiot ( or team of idiots ) that didn't know how to color correct or export, which is bad enough, but the spinning screen and page peel transitions were like an ungifted child doodling on a Picasso. The Warner Bros. distributed version looks a million times better but sound effects with the spiders, Smaug, and Battle of The Five Armies are missing; leaving long annoying gaps of silence. Maybe Warner Bros. will re-issue ""The Exorcist"" for kids without those scary sound effects."
positive,Harry Potter is fantastic on Blu-ray: Masterful story! Entertaining film. Excellent 5-star picture quality with 1080p. Superior Uncompressed Audio track PCM 5.1. Definite buy for any Harry Potter fans or anyone with an HDTV and blu-ray set.
negative,"Author's youth can only excuse it, not save it: I picked this up for a nice break after reading quite a bit of informative non-fiction, knowing that a children's phenomenon would probably be a fun read. And I have absolutely no bias against the children's section; I love it, and think Harry Potter needs to be on the regular best-seller lists. Unfortunately, this one disappoints. Ugh. I struggled to finish.If you think this is a great read, then congratulations on finding the fantasy genre. You can definitely find better, everywhere. I don't mind the lack of originality that most people harp on. At least the tried-and-true plotlines make the story move (thus two stars). But the dialogue sounds like people talk in essay format. I get that Paolini is young, so let's wait until he learns to write and then praise him. After all, youth isn't a literary quality; it's an excuse for lack thereof."
positive,"Absolutely the best pastry I have ever tasted ...it melts in your mouth and is the basis for becoming a legend in your own time.: The crusts you make with the help of this book are magical. My husband looked at me and said this is absolutely the most wonderful thing I have ever eaten. Even the bottom crust is flaky and gives the most satisfying crispy sound as your fork dives in for one more delectable, scrumptious bite."
negative,Sims 2 for Computor: My kids have played this game and loved it. So we bought it for one of them for there birthday. But it requires a lot of memory and we were unable to download it to our computor. We ended up selling it to another Amazon Customer. So be warned if you purchase for your computor besure you have enough memory to run the game.
positive,"Fun and Thoughtful: This was a very fun and thoughtful movie. Barbara Streisand sings her best in a fun and kooky story about a woman who has special powers. She goes to see a hypnotherapist, who figures out that he can communicate with her past lives. I quite enjoyed it. Very family friendly."
positive,Pinocchio: I had bought two DVD on Pinocchio. One for me and the other for my great niece whose birthday is coming up.I enjoy watching the movie. I hope my great niece will too.
negative,"Chinese-made piece of junk: When I bought this foot pump I wasn't expecting much of it, given the ridiculously low price I paid (less than 10$). However, it turned out to be even below my expectations: there is no way it can reach its maximum rating of 100 PSI since it can barely handle a bicycle tyre. This really confirms that what you pay is what you get! I guess this is the kind of product that really needs to be seen -and felt- in order to assess the quality of its construction."
positive,"The best guitarist you've never heard of.: Rudy Perrone is the quintessential guitar player. Melodic, daring, inventive, and blatantly talented, he embodies everything from the skills of Hendrix to the lyrical talent of Neil Young. The range of emotions that are invoked listening to this recording range from childhood memories, to regret of the past, and finally to hope for the future. I strongly advise anybody stumbling across this review to give Rudy Perrone a listen and wonder why more aren't. Spread the word!"
positive,"Popular with middle school students: This book was one of the most popular on the shelf for independent reading this year, with both male and female middle school students. Perhaps it was because it is based on an actual event. Perhaps the straight forward language used by the author appealed. Whatever the reason, as a teacher, I make note of any book that motivates students to read, and this one did."
negative,"""C"" runs like a female duck: The scenes where Calogero runs are just sad to me. The poor guy has obviously never been a normal kid. He looks ridiculous. This is why the Fonz never ran on ""Happy Days""."
positive,"Introjection: I waited quite a long spell for this record to come out and the last few weeks of the wait have brought plenty of new articles, interviews, and reviews to heighten the anticipation. Most of the commentary I've read thus far has been positive, but there are a few spiteful reviews that want to dismiss the latest offering from The Wallflowers as a Tom Petty rip off. To those out there tempted to grab that nonsense and run with it, I want to share a word with you that I just recently learned to appreciate, myself. The full meaning of it hit me when I listened to Breach for the first time. Introjection: absorbing the characteristics of outside objects or persons by the self which then reacts to them as if they were internal. Breach achieves introjection of influences from The Pixies, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, and Elvis Costello, to name three, yet the songs are fully Jakob Dylan's own-and that's a good thing, despite what hucksters who seethe for a living would have us believe."
positive,"One of the Best of all Time...: I first read this book when I was 14 (I am 19 now) and I read this book every summer. It is one of my all-time favorites! This book is the story of Patty Bergen who lives in Arkansas during WW2. Her parents are mean and cruel to her and the only person she can find acceptance in is her housekeeper, Ruth. That is, until Patty meets a German soldier hiding from the authorities in her small town. His name is Anton Reiker and he is not a Nazi. Patty hides him above the garage. Their relationship is brought about by Patty's feelings of rejection by her parents and Anton is looking for someone to love. I do wish at the end, though, that Anton had hit Patty's father! This book will bring tears to your eyes as you read the story of Patty and Anton friendship."
negative,"Pure CHEESE.: This movie is so stupid I'm not sure where to begin. Right from the start, you are subjected to poor acting, EXTREMELY pathetic dialogue, and an overall lame story. I almost enjoyed watching this for its laughable cheesiness. I give it one star because I was amused by the dialogue that was either inconceivably stupid or stereotypical, as well as the obvious homoerotic undertones between the 2 main characters. Several scenes were there for no other reason than to suggest there was more going on between these guys than was shown, if ya know what I mean."
negative,"Plastic GARBAGE: I wish there was a no star rating. This coffee maker is nothing more than expensive plastic garbage. It lasted just long enough for the warranty to expire. ""Probably the pump gave out, we can offer you a sizable discount on a new one"" You can't you repair the pump and the sizable discount is about 20%. Big deal, why would I throw good money after bad. Save yourself lots of money, don't buy this coffee maker."
negative,"A complete disappointment: This book was a complete disappointment for me. I enjoyed the movie and was delighted when my book club decided to read the book. Unlike the loveable Julie from the movie, Julie Powell is self absorbed and moany. She tries far too hard to be witty and amusing and it just doesn't work. The book jumps from one subject to the next with some personal stuff thrown in about her pals who I don't really care about as they don't really add to the subject. Since reading the book I have checked out her blog and can not say that I am surprised that Julia Child did not approve. It is a great dis-service to Julia Child. I would find it insulting to have my name associated with it."
positive,"Excellent, accurate, and detailed: This incredible book is a gem. Filled with black and white illustrations from the period in question, the fashion plates, drawings, caricatures, and portraits help create a strong sense of the 19th century. This book follows the gradual changes and shows the overall shape of each chunk of time in the form of silhouettes (The author prefaces each section with a gray on white figure outlining the nature of that time's costume). While this book may be out of print, it is well worth the search if your passion is costume history through primary resources, particularly that of the 19th century. The approach is purely pictorial, but if what you want to know is the look, this book is excellent."
positive,"Cheaper by the dozen: Cheaper by the Dozen is a great ""read aloud"" book for all ages. I first read this book to our children when I was homeschooling them. Now that they are grown and have left home, my husband and I are reading it together (he missed out the first time!). We are planning to read the sequel Belles on Their Toes when we have finished."
negative,worst book i have ever read: this book was excruciatingly painful to read. when i read this book i finally understood the definition of the word infinity. i would recomend this book to friends who have insomnia or those who i absolutely despise.
negative,"Disappointed: I love Anne and I love the Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea movies, but this lacks the spark of the prior movies and the director's insistence on ridiculous coincidences is just beyond realism and ruins the story. I know Anne has to grow up, but this doesn't match the true character of who I believe most of us feel she is and I am sadly disappointed. I wish I would not have purchased it first and I will forever end my memory with such a bittersweet way. I give it two stars only because I enjoy seeing the original actors in the movie, but I regret my purchase and would have just stuck with the original movies and never watched this one."
positive,"Christopher Walken scarier than the aliens: Christopher Walken is scarier than the aliens, but the film manages to stir up some creepy paranoia at times. The scenes aboard the spaceship (or whatever it was) were a little weak, but in the cabin and in that long spooky school hallway were well done."
negative,missing....: i ordered this dvd for my dad's birthday. he opened it a few days later to watch and found no dvd in the case!
negative,"Not good at all: The Rolling Stones' new album is the most horrible CD I have ever heard, plus they never made anything good in their whole career. They suck so hard. Why do people like this band so much?This is noise. Get any album from Green Day, Dire Straits, or Guns N' Roses insted."
negative,"Spider Man - Extreme Threat: I was very disappointed in this movie. My young grandson loves Spiderman and Superman movies. I purchased this DVD for his birthday. However, after viewing this movie, I found this animated version to have inappropriate language throughout. I cannot recommend this movie to other parents or grandparents."
positive,Spongebob movie the best movie ever!: I saw this movie twice in theaters it was the best animated movie ever!I liked it more then the incredibles.Actuly I don't like it I love it!!!!!
negative,Untitled: This book was a school reading assignment. When I first began to read it I anticipated that it would be rather dumb. It turns out that i was correct. I could not become interested. It had the worst plot and why anyone would read it for the purpose of personal interest it is umm oh yea stupid. Summing up my review I think it never should have been written.
negative,"What the heck is this?: The fine print on this title says that it's from Allegra Entertainment, copyright 2006. However, based on the washed-out cinematography, poor film quality, low-budget costumes, and portentious narration style, if this was made after 1970, I'll eat the disk. There are no credits or supplemental information of any kind on the disks, and there's no listing for it on the internet movie database, nor can I find anything about it with Google. Does anyone have any idea whether this used to be called something else, and when the heck it was made?"
positive,"Classic & Easy to Read: A ""how to write well"" book that's actually an interesting read from cover to cover. You should read this book before you enter the workplace and revisit it every few years. Modern and timeless."
positive,love it: he has always wanted one of these for a long time. Now he's happy. He will be cooking hot dogs forever now.
positive,"You will FALL IN LOVE with Auel's Ayla!!: You must read this book! I highly, highly recommend it, along with the rest of the Earth Children's Series. You will love these books! Ayla is the strongest, most beautiful, lovable character I have ever confronted in literature. If I could meet any fictional character - it would without a doubt be Ayla. :-)The books are written beautifully as well. Auel does a fabulous job bringing the ice-age to life through breathtaking images and memorable characters.My ONLY complaint in this series is that the sex scenes are ridiculously ""too perfect"" - Augh. They could definitely be shorter, and there could be fewer of them. (You will not encounter these though, until the later books in the series, if you decide to read on.)I am a little hesitant for the final (6th) book to come out though... the 5th one ended on such a high note, I'm afraid to read on. Eeep."
positive,"Here's the skinny on this release: Four stars for the creative band, KISS, and for these strong, early records. This box is new from Universal and includes the first three CDs, ""Kiss,"" ""Hotter Than Hell"" and ""Dressed To Kill."" The actual discs are dated ""1997,"" so they are probably the original remasters, and not new remasters, I am guessing. The box includes the three CD covers of the orignal three CDs, but no additional artwork or liner notes. Although some might prefer the 1980s work and beyond, KISS' strong period will always be the 1970s, and their pre""Alive"" recordings are found here."
positive,Life Jacket VEST red: This item arrived on time and it is a good product for my family... It a good piece with very performance...Thank you...It has a good price...
positive,"Waiting To Take You Away: Where Pepper has been labeled a psychedelic album,MMT shows a more detailed picture of The Beatles foray in this genre.Where the British version was a two EP set(?)of the soundtrack music,the US version expanded it to an album that included the non-album singles from '67(Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane,All You Need Is Love/Baby,You're A Rich Man & Hello,Goodbye).The best songs from the film are the now standard Fool On The Hill,as well as the brilliant I Am The Walrus.Your Mother Should Know has a certain charm that even made the final scene in that terrible movie a welcome relief.Even for those who didn't see MMT(or who did and regrets it)the music in the end always conjures up a vivid picture of The Beatles psychedelic period."
negative,"Treading Water: This Inner Life lp is much like the earlier ""I'm Caught Up"" in that it showcases a spectacular song (""Moment Of My Life"") and the rest is filler. This track can be found elsewhere on compilation sets in both original and remixed forms."
negative,"Just okay: I really dont know what the hype is over this book. Its considered a classic, yet, it is boring reading. I didn't find any of the characters of any interest and the pace is slow."
positive,"Tuva or Bust! A journey worth taking.: Having the priviledge of seeing the play QED catalyzed my purchase of this wonderful book. This is no ordinary journey by no ordinary genius(es). It is a hilarious example of persistance required to learn all there is to know (without the aid of the Internet!) about an inaccessible culture, and then secure permission to travel to a dream-like land. This easy to read book makes me want to pick an obscure topic and make it my own hobby.My only disappointment is that the narrative lacked information about Professor Feynman's more personal trials and thoughts during this demanding period of his life. There were many chapters that rarely mentioned Feynman as the ""journey"" continued. Beyond that, it is a must read, not just for Feynman fans like myself, but for all of us that need to refresh ourselves with a bit of eccentricity in the form of a unique, personal goal."
negative,"Serious Quality Problems... On Our 3rd One!!!: As others have reported, Keurig has a severe problem with reliability on the B70 machines. We are on our third one in less than a year. They work fine for a while and then they cease to completely fill the cups. Note that this is actually our fourth one since Christmas 2009 as our original, since discontinued Costco-only model B76 also developed the same problems. We've returned each one for a new one to Costco, who have told us that they have had a ridiculous number of returns (on the previous one the woman told me it was the third one she'd taken back that day!).Wonderful machine when it works, but this is ridiculous. If this one dies also, we'll try and get through our remaining K-cups and then give up on Keurig.UPDATE: 8/11/11 Just returned the fourth Keurig, as it quit working altogether, and this time did not purchase another. We're done. Just amazes me how this company can't design a product that will last."
positive,"My lip stuff--- chai: Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time. I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff, and I'm happy with every single one of them!"
positive,"nuttiest nutcracker: my 9 year old is autistic and saw the outside cover of the dvd, thinking it was a ""zucchini birthday party."" so i had to purchase it. now she sees that it is about alot of veggies, celebrating and just loves it. thanks."
positive,"Great for the sun!: It takes a few minutes to set up, but I really don't have any complaints about it. I use it almost daily in the summer at the local pool, and have used it several times at the beach. I suppose it could have pouches to fill with sand so it doesn't blow away like some other beach tents have, but I always just put my beach bag in there and I've never had any problem. At the pool, I just put a beach towel in there for my little one to lay on, no need to weigh it down with anything else unless it is a very windy day. I love that is has mesh on three sides so that the baby gets air and you can see them easily from any angle, but the sun is not getting them. Very useful little item that I'm sure we'll be using at least until the baby is done with naps. One of the best purchases I've made for this baby."
negative,"Mega boring: A good book to put someone to sleep. It can be read in about a day, if that is what you are looking for. It barely predicts anything but it certainly points out some past precedents that have future implications.A good book for Geography or Urban Planning Majors."
positive,"Everybody's Hero: Everybody's hero is called 'Baby' in this movie. People who try to make themselves into heroes by clinging to a system which attempts to demonstrate that it has values like the Kellermans, who are constantly trying to control the situation here, end up being like ""the big creep"" when they have to fire people who have emotional outbursts about this kind of thing. Curiously, as I remember this movie, there is a doctor who says, ""When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong."" This must be pure fantasy."
positive,"Heritage Press' Life on the Mississippi: This review relates to the Heritage 1944 edition...Heritage's Life on the Mississippi features a dusky green slipcase; book is covered in textured green cloth with a riverboat emblem. Over 40 Thomas Hart Benton illustrations in color and black & white.Includes ""a number of previously suppressed passages, now printed for the first time and edited with a note from Willis Wager.""418 pp, decorated cloth over hardback boards, sewn binding."
positive,New Dieter's Every Day Cookbook: I've had this cookbook for a number of years and bought it as a gift for my nephew and his new bride. They love the recipes. I have never had a bad recipe from this book and it's all with health in mind.
negative,"DULLSVILLE: MAXIMUM VELOCITY's script is so shoddily written and so many plot devices unexplained, one has to wonder what in the world it was made for. Seems like perennial bad guy Michael Ironside and the US AIR FORCE have developed a Storm Fury program that can generate devastating hurricanes, and has been designed as a weapon of destruction. However, when a black comet passes through the earth's atmosphere, it causes a superstorm with the potential to devastate the entire east coast. Now Ironside seems to be doing good when Storm Fury is reinstituted to destroy this storm. The script is so wishy washy and unfocused that what little tension or suspense is generated is wasted on the muddled governmental interference. Dale Midkiff (Pet Sematary) is wasted in his good guy role, and the rest of the cast merely does their shtick. A disappointingly dull movie."
negative,"A struggle to get through...: I read Birds of Prey -- my first book by this author and loved every minute of it. Consequently, I was very happy to find Men of Men in the library. Unfortunately, my happiness was short-lived. I found it a struggle to get through most of this book, so I finally quit at just over half way through it. I found it rather boring. I gave it two stars because every now and then something would happen that I found interesting, but for the most part, the book was not what I expected. However, because of how much I liked Birds of Prey, I haven't given up on the author yet. I'll try something else. This book just didn't do it for me."
positive,"Good for begginers: I was looking for a good camcorder for beginers. This one is perfect. It is not the best camcorder, but a very good one. I gave it 5 stars because the price is cheaper than it should be.It is worth much more than it is."
negative,"Like a Cheesy Info-mercial...: Eve Plumb seems to be the only former Brady that's made anything of herself that isn't totally focused on the Brady-glory-days. She's an established artist! The 2 stars are for her alone. Seeing her with her art work was worth watching the disk...but not worth owning it.Oh, Ann B. Davis is really cool too! She's a stage performer now.If you're a Die-Hard Brady Fan and can't get enough of 'em then this disk is for you. Sure, you'll see some of their home movies...they say ""Never before seen footage..."" But, none of it was a real big suprise to me. I've seen their home movie footage on several TV Tabloids, encluding E True Hollywood. Their playful banter with each other seems VERY scripted and phoney.Personally, I'd like my Brady Memories to remain with the show that made them all famous to begin with.Bring their Series episodes to DVD Format. I'd line up to buy those! I'm not kidding!!!!This was too cheesy."
positive,"Better wireless for TiVo: When you upgrade to a TiVo with HD you must buy their wireless adaptor (and I wish that had been clear when I upgraded). Good news is that their ""G"" gave my TiVo twice the signal strength that my LinkSys ""B"" did, so I'm a happy camper. It is great Plug 'n Play."
positive,"Works great, easy to program . . . why the extra buttons?: This opener appears to be well-built, it works just as it should, instructions for programming (and the programming process) were straightforward and quick, and the price I found on Amazon (<$20) was great. Also, the device came with the needed battery installed, and it has a nice, clean design. I am very pleased with my purchase.I am at a loss as to why this opener (and the one it replaced) has three buttons. I know I had the option of setting up any of the buttons to open my door, but why does a consumer need three? I suspect some may have multiple doors to open?Nonetheless, this is a fine product at a great price."
positive,"Great value!: This is a very valuable addition to my router accessories. It works very well at a fraction of the cost of the after-market router lifts. The lift screw retainer seems to work fine as long as you remember to release the locking lever. I'm glad to know that the drill stop fix is always available as a backup plan if the c-clip does fail. I only had to locate and drill a hole for the adjuster, and then I was making moldings like a pro."
positive,"Wonderful for stress relief: This tea is amazing for stress relief. Just one cup and I am very ""chill"". I have this tea in the reserves for particularly tough days. It has a rather pleasant taste and while I can fall asleep after drinking it, I can still stay awake enough to accomplish tasks. Though, for best use of stress relief plan to just lie down and do something calming."
positive,"A Timeless Classic: I have seen the movie,many times,but never read the book.It is a timeless classic,& I will recommend it,to anyone that I know,that owns a Kindle Fire."
positive,"I love this book!: The author covers a great deal on commands and syntax, but the true strength of this title lies in its ability impart an understanding of the logic and numerous concepts behind PHP/MySQL development. I would most recommend this book to those individuals who are comfortable with HTML and CSS, and have at least minimal programming experience. Sharp and dedicated ""no-experience"" beginners could probably figure things out as they go along, but it would require some effort. I personally think that's a fair trade for a book that will prove itself invaluable to anyone seriously interested in learning PHP/MySQL development."
negative,"DIS-AP-POINT-ING: Critics complained a lot about THE MUMMY. They said it was too corny, that the historical facts were inacturate (sp?), and that there were many plot holes. Well, I said ""tough beans"" to them because I enjoyed THE MUMMY a lot. Now THE MUMMY RETURNS, that's where I agree with the critics. I was so disappointed with this sequel because the plotline was so vague and so disposable (sp?) that it makes THE MUMMY'S plotline seem solid. It has something to do with some magical braclet that supposed to bring back some Scorpian King...ah, who cares?! I really hope they don't make a third sequel."
negative,"A total reinvetion of the legend: Where to start with what is wrong...The costumes and weapons are not the correct period, Jesus has fair skin and blue eyes. Joan has black hair not blond, the accents are all over Europe and not correct for the English or French except the few times a real Frenchmen is cast, and because of research done by French historians such as Roger Caratini, Its clear today that Joan's influce in battle was less leading the charge and more along for the ride.Lets not talk about the acting, but rather the over acting. I wouldn't go after every actor but Mila J goes from wimpering idiot straight to wild eyed loon at the drop of a hat.The real Joan of Arc was zealot that heard voices yet was charismatic enough to rally the French at a critical time and was sold out to the English when her usefulness to crazy ratio dipped too low. This movie portrays her as a raving loon that got what was coming to her."
negative,Relaxing viewing time: A DVD of clear good photography and quite pleasant to watch but a little embarrasing in family company. Really only suitable for watching in private.
positive,"Stones rockin' with power: A number of old rock acts have come out with ""new"" albums lately, but the Stones have actually produced one with power and lyrics and melodies that stick in your head. They impress with creativity and energy that many of the ""modern"" acts don't. Some highlights:""Rough Justice"" and ""Oh No Not You Again"" are some of the more powerful rocking tunes on this CD, good for cranking up when you're p'd off, or maybe need inspiration for a good workout.""Laugh I Nearly Died"" is a bluesy, moody piece, good for those rainy days. So too is ""Rain Fall Down"", a bit reminiscent of the dark, steamy scene set in ""She Was Hot"" in the album ""Undercover"".""Back of My Hand"" is a good bluesy tune in the style of the classic bluesmen with acoustic guitars and such.All in all, this CD should be one that will sit in your player for quite awhile."
positive,"Demons, Fortune Tellers, Religion, Oh my!: This movie is one of the best horror films. The plot is original, the actors believable, the sets very visual... even the soundtracks pretty good! The special effects are fair. The plot involves an attractive womans quest to destroy cheating men in general and in particular, a young man who hopes to become a minister. Alas, he is the last of his line. Whats her deal? Buy it and see! Several known performers in this film: Melba Moore, Hardison, TWO Jacksons (one famous Samuel, oh and Freddie) The climax of the film is intense, the ending is excellent. Bored with other horror films because they're all clones? Buy this one then.... it's a standout!"
negative,"I didn't undertsand it!: Although this book was very well written, I couldn't understand it very well. I probably would not have finished it if it hadn't been required reading for school. I would think that older kids might be able to undertsand it, but that most of it is too subtle for eighth graders."
positive,"Happy with this and having a ball: This ball is made of thick and durable plastic -- seems more heavy-duty than the balls at my gym. I use it as an office chair in addition to using it for exercises. The hand pump worked fine. I followed the instructions and filled the ball half way, left it overnight and completed filling it the next day. All-total, filling the ball took only 15 minutes. They provided very clear instructions on how to measure the filled ball. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the instructions mentioned a bicycle pump needle attachment that wasn't included in my box."
negative,"Industrial, though not ""Professional"": I too bought this disc because Ray McVeigh is the guitarist. His playing on the Professionals ""I Didn't See It Coming"" record is incredible. The guitar tandem of Ray and Steve Jones (sex pistOls) on that record was, as far as I'm concerned, the punk equivalent of Keith Richards and Ron Wood. Tasteful, catchy, weaving guitar lines that are stuck in my head forever.There is none of that here. Like many industrial records, everything is so sludged in effects, you can't make out any style at all. There are also appearances by a few other artists I dig, but the same problem exists there.If you need another industrial record, this is better than Filter, or any of that nonsense, but it's nothing that's going to change your life."
negative,"Not better the second time: I have been a real fan of Jan Karon and Father Tim, even reading both Father Tim novels, although this is not the place to review them.Mitford is a comforting place to visit, and I have been forced to be immobile, so I re-read the Mitford books for escape.I remembered Light from Heaven as being Light-weight and disappointing, and upon reading it again suffered the same disappointment. It was not really a Mitford book - although some of the people from the earlier books were mentioned but not really part of the story.Just too many neat coincidences. I agree with some of the earlier reviewers that it seemed like the author just strung together some episodes and then just gave up. Sigh!Ps: I am a Christian very active in my church, but I like good people better when there is a little spice to them. Sometimes Father Tim just seems a little tooooo good to be true."
positive,"Excellent Older Edition: This is an older edition of ""Leaves of Grass"" , it downloaded fast and I was able to read it in a minute or so."
positive,"Not bad but one suggestion: The ball hopper is easy to use. Stucture is sturdy enough to carry around. However, one simple thing to add is a clip to hold handle/leg together when it folded to be stored in truck without banging."
positive,hot replacement pickup: good sounding high output replacement pickup with original sound ...not the over driven humbucking sound of some others I've tried.
negative,"BOOOOOOring...: This movie sucked, yes i agree that it had it's funny parts but for the most part it sucked."
positive,"Fantastic album: This is a wonderful album. It's very mellow in that the songs are mostly ballads and mid-tempo. It's also a modern country album, but retains a little bit of traditional country. ""Ashes By Now"" and ""Does My Ring Burn Your Finger"" are traditional, but not too traditional for me to enjoy.""Does My Ring Burn Your Finger"" is the best song on the album and my favorite; the opening guitar work in the beginning is so magnificent that I keep putting that part on repeat, and her drawl expresses the attitude in the song. I love sassy attitude songs. :)The rest of the songs have enjoyable melodies except for ""Lonely Too,"" which doesn't stand out. ""The Healing Kind,"" ""Why They Call It Falling,"" and ""Stronger Than I Am"" are especially touching ballads.This is a very smooth album and it keeps the mellow mood throughout, even on the faster tempo songs. It's a fantastic album."
negative,Sent Wrong Item! Ordered 2002 edition/Sent 1986 edition!: I ordered a copy of this Dictionary that according to the site was published in June of 2002 for a local school spelling bee. I was sent an older copy of this dictionary that was published in 1986 that is too old to be of use in the spelling bee. I have written e-mail to the seller asking that he either send me the updated 2002 dictionary or refund my money and have not heard anything back yet! I hope that my school's students are not going to be dissapointed!
negative,"The Pitching Edge by Tom House: House did not write this book for Little League coaches who want to help their kids. It is loaded with hyper-technical jargon that House does not explain and won't make sense to experienced players and coaches. For example, in a section on how to pitch off a mound, House states, ""A pitcher must find and keep an upper body spine-to-hip relationship with a constant angle of flex in posting knee at front leg lift, stride and landing -- directing upper body into torso rotation and launch of a baseball."" What? His science may be correct, but you won't benefit from this book because House does not translate the science into common sense terms that ballplayers will understand."
negative,"More like a short story stretched into a novel.: The plot was thin. We followed characters that had absolutely no bearing on the plot. Some of the prose, while stylish and full of images, seemed random and sometimes confusing. This story had a lot of potential, but it feels like a 3 page short story stretched to make a novel. Not Zelazny's best work."
negative,"Another New York chick flick: The older woman, younger man theme is just really harsh.Add a Jewish doctor for a mother who is treating theolder woman after her divorce and you get a disaster thatreally never convinces us of more than animal passion.As a basis for a long term marriage with children,a ""happy ending"" is probably a disaster?It takes more for a successful marriage than just lust..."
positive,"Timeless Classic: I enjoyed this book a lot, once I got past the slow parts. Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won't reveal the identity of the father, she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter ""A"" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around, so at the end of the book, people refer to her as ""Angel"" instead of ""Adulterer.""This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong, the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It's our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. Redemption is possible for anyone, regardless of their sin. Also, the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader, suffers enormously because he doesn't confess. This is a good point. When we hide our sins, the only person it ultimately hurts, is us."
negative,"Should characters have brains?: When I first started to read this book, I recognized right away a lot of potential in the story. All of the scary elements that I was hoping for were there, and the pace drew me in immediately. But as the book went on I became annoyed at first, and gradually frustrated with the character's complete lack of brains.As bad things start to go down, the characters seem to want to do everything except for the obvious - leave. There is nothing that really forces anyone in this story to stay where they are at, and as the death toll mounts and creepy goings on get more sinister, it never seems to cross any ones mind that the simplest solution would be to find a nicer neighborhood. It is like there is a Masterton IQ Reduction Chip (tm) lodged inside each character's head!And as silly as that sounds, had the author used a gimmick like this to explain the stupidity of his characters, I probably could have enjoyed the narrative enough to have given it 3.5-4 stars instead of 1."
negative,It didnt work: I kept getting an error message when trying to install it. I ended up having to return it unfortunately. sorry
negative,"Don't buy unless.............: If you like peeing blood, go ahead and buy these. Seriously, I would have to say race only. On the street they are horrible, I am on here to buy Pro springs to replace."
negative,"Not was I was hoping for: Please take this review with a grain of salt, as it's been years since I heard it, but when I bought this album back in the 70's(on the strength of a cool cover and a title which promised pounding music), I was very disappointed. I'm not saying that this is a bad album, simply that it is marketed as a heavy metal album, and it's not. It's a pop record. There is nothing remotely heavy about this record, unless your idea of heavy is Boston with less distortion. If very light rock is your thing, it may be something to check out, but don't be fooled by the title or the cover. Trust me, this wasn't even heavy by 70's standards."
positive,Bad Dog: Enjoyed the quick read book however it was not what I was expecting. It was more like a kid's book or a waiting room book. It was cute.
positive,"good story: This is an interesting and well-written book. Jason Green, an overweight teen, makes insightful observations about the world around him. Although the theme is golf, something I'm not particularly interested in, I was drawn in by a story that ultimately tells you that you have to be true to yourself, and loyal to your friends."
positive,Jack and the Giant: A Story Full of Beans: This wonderful book has a great Southwest twist and the illustrations are incredible!
negative,"poetic but excessive: I have not read any of Charlie Smith's other work, so I can't compare this to previous efforts. His writing is poetic, and truly impressive in short bursts. But over the long haul, the poetry interferes with the prose. Words and phrases seem to be chosen more for their sounds and rhythms than for their contributions to plot, and dialogue can be stilted. Imagery is vivid but occasionally self-indulgent. The storyline is interesting at first but eventually grows gaudy and distasteful. The power of Smith's language is his greatest strength, but it is a strength better suited to poetry than novels."
negative,"Always the same.: i enjoy alot of steven's music, and don't dislike this CD; the only problem being that it sounds the same as ever other album he's ever done. he wasn't even original on his first CD, and now - how many ablums down the road? - he still sounds the same. i wouldn't suggest buying this CD. just buy one and you've heard it all."
positive,Cute but little washclothes: My friends likes these wash cloths for their twins but they are tiny and I imagine will need frequent washing.
positive,A Must for a Wireless Network: A Must for any Wireless Network User. Hook up is very simple and takes less than 5 min. per Tivo in your home.
positive,"A High School Student's Short Opinion: I was required to read this book in my Honors Literature class. The book started off as somewhat interesting and grew boring, then interesting again. While the rest of the class hated it thoroughly, I took the time to really dig into what the book was about and what my teacher had to say about it. And now, looking back, I think that this is one of the most profound books I have read this year. The use of symbolism is incredible and the book has amazing depth...or maybe I just had a fabulous teacher. :)"
negative,"Don't waste your money: This book consisted of black and white 2D scetches that lacked any real depth or detail. They are basic and generalised in presenting each period and contain nothing new that you would not have already seen or known about that decade.I do not recommend it to anyone who has a intrest in costume or design, but think it would be better suited as a childrens colouring in book.Don't waste your money."
positive,"Beautiful!: This is the gorgeous gold boxed edition with photocopies of Tolkien's own notes, hand-drawn maps, and original manuscripts inserted. Just beautiful.I love to find notes and sketches and highlights in books, so I bought an ""acceptable"" version, and it is pristine! I can probably see my face shining in the ""very good"" ones! :PI don't need to rate the literature itself. It's The Greatest Adventure! <3 If you haven't read The Hobbit, I honestly feel sad for you; you are missing out on something huge, something magical, something beautiful.""In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit."" Isn't that a wonderful beginning? ;)Yes, I'm that jerk who bought the book because the movie came out, but only because I hadn't read it in years and couldn't find my own copy. I wanted to catch up again before I saw the movie. Still haven't seen it!"
negative,"This one's a loser: Maggie Shayne can certainly write, but this one is a loser. It was difficult to warm up to the hero and heroine - Edie, a former lingerie model is cold and colorless, she returns to her home town and buys up the property that Wade has always wanted because he ticked her off. This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property. The scene where her sister is being tortured is far too explicit for a category romance and more appropriate to a mainstream thriller. The rest of Edie's family were far more interesting than the main characters. Overall, disappointing and not nice."
negative,"Cheap and small - you get what you pay for: In agreement with a previous review. These spoons are reasonably sturdy, but are very small -- the picture is a bit deceiving. You get what you pay for, what can I say?"
positive,"PERFECT !!!!: The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is one of the greatest albulms ever made. She practically touched on every part of human emotion. My favorite song is the one ""to Zion"" a beautiful song about Lauryn choosing her child over the lifestyles of fame, having her baby ignoring what people thought. The choir coming in and giving her back-up was excellent it was just beautiful, spiritual if you will. I also like ""doo woop (that thing)"" her first single off the album a nice upbeat song with the drums, horns, Lauryn's beautiful voice, that was perfect too. Another one of my favorite songs was ""Nothing Even Matters"" her duet with D'Angelo very pretty and soulful, one of my favorite songs period. I could go on and on about every track but then I'd ruin the experience for you. Go out and buy it it's an excellent work of art."
positive,"Throtons: I was very happy and excited with this purchase. I have been looking for this product for a while but never knew what they were called in order to search for it. It's our family's favorite summer toy and we just called it a ""throwbie"", but there was only one among us that my husband had from his college years (which actually has lasted over 15 years - showing how durable it is). I wanted to buy one for each family with kids because it was really helpful in teaching them to catch & throw because the throton is rubbery soft and they are not afraid of it. It is also the favorite throwing toy among all of the adults - men & women alike - and we can play with it for hours whether on land or in the lake. This Set of 6 purchase through Amazon.com was the best deal since I was able to buy 6 different colored ones for each family like I wanted at a final cost of $15 each versus $20 or higher at other places."
negative,Waste of money at ANY price!: I bought this flashlight an used it a few times and a few times is all it can be used. I hadn't picked it up in a couple of months and when I tried to use it I could not get it to turn on. Lousy product.
negative,"No Good: This pencil sharpener just arrived today and it doesn't work at all. Very disappointed. It is going back. I have had other Xacto sharpeners that have held up . As a classroom teacher, a durable pencil sharpener is a must."
negative,"Ben Stiller Keeps On Sucking...: I have to agree with the other 1-star reviewers. This movie sucks. Ben Stiller needs to get a life and stop appearing in every single comedy movie. Same thing with the ever-so-not-funny Vince Vaughn. This is stupid. It's not so stupid that it's funny, it's so stupid that you want to vomit.I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it came out. Luckily, I never had the chance, because Ben Stiller's (...). When I saw it on DVD, I was far from disappointed. I was disgusted! If I recorded a game of dodgeball during gym class, this would be better than this piece of crap. Besides, who likes the game dodgeball?(...)"
negative,"""this movie is awful"": there is no words to describe this movie! all i can say this movie sucks and it was awful!"
negative,"Lord of the Flies: I hated this book!! It was boring and violent. I didn't want to read it at all, but I had to for school. I had two weeks to read it and I thought, 'oh no problem'. I could hardly sit and read this book for five minutes!! I will never read this book again."
negative,"Poor instructions and Poorly made: My son got this for christmas and we spent almost 2 hours trying to put it together. It does not snap well into the holes and does not stay together well. Everytime you try and move it, it all falls apart. We ended up returning it, definetely not kid tested."
negative,"buy the import !!!!: If you must have Speak and Spell ( which is quite good, despite being very lightweight, fluffy, lyrically empty early-eighties synth-pop ) do yourself a favour and spend the extra money on the import version. The US version pales in comparison to the original Uk version. There is a great song ( Sometimes I Wish I Was Dead, which is not as depressing as its title would suggest ) that was left off the US pressing, and the extra time was taken up by the inclusion of the 12"" remix of Just Can't Get Enough (which is better in its original 7"" mix anyway - over six minutes of Just Can't Get Enough is, well, too much of enough ). There are also a few great b-sides that are on the UK version of the cd."
negative,"It Bloody Wasn't: Go buy "" Bridges "", "" Steel Wheels "" and avoid the God Awful "" Voodoo Lounge "" and don't waste your time with this rehash of "" Bridges "" "" Steel Wheels "" and the God Awful "" Voodoo Lounge """
positive,"Tea Chest Review - More for the tea than the chest: This item is what it mostly says it is. Most of the tea flavors are decent (I especially like the Peach Tea, but dislike the Orange Spice Tea). Recently these Bentley Tea Chests have been on sale at Amazon for quite decent prices. Don't expect too much from the box though. It's a paper covered pine box with a couple of handles and a front catch. It does have a very thin velvet lining inside, but I wouldn't count on the inside box cells to isolate flavors or prevent oxidation, so foil or paper covered tea bags are a must for this tea chest. Overall a decent value if you buy it on a good sale."
negative,"This book was a bit too redundant.: I think Jean Auel is an awesome writer. However, I think this book focused way too much on ""how amazing"" Ayla was in the eyes of all the other characters. I adored Ayla in ""Clan of the Cave Bear,"" and ""Valley of Horses."" (I have read those two books over and over again.) In this book, Ayla seems too subdued, or not really shining through, as in her previous books. I agreed with one reviewer which stated that Ayla spent too much time explaining and retelling what all of Auel's readers had already read in her previous books. I probably will never re-read this book. I still love Jean Auel and Ayla!"
positive,"A Great Garwood Romance Mystery: I really enjoyed this novel.It was my third Garwood read, The Bride being the first. I have to admit that the first chapter was pretty confusing and I almost gave up trying to understand the story line. However, once it became clear as to what was going on I was hooked,and it was oh so hard to put down. It had a complex but thoroughly enjoying plot that was very witty and mysterious with the missing Arrianne's box. Brodich is very much an arrogant but endearing leader who met his true soul mate in Gillian. They complemented each other completely.This book had a lot of characters and a bewildering start. But don't give up. I think this is Garwood's best yet!"
positive,"Americas: I have learned things I never knew, I wish they would make school childen read this history, it would change their opinion about many things!"
positive,"Works like a charm: I bought this, the Le Creuset enameled crepe pan, and a crepe recipe book for my husband for Christmas (he's crazy for crepes). At first the spatuala looked too big for the 8 in pan but it actually worked like a charm. This was our first time making crepes and it takes a little practice but was great fun and the spatula is a big help. It is somewhat pourus wood so will darken a bit from the oil/butter in the crepe pan, but it doesn't detract."
positive,"herbal life 1: The product was sealed however, it did take some time to arrive. Other than that the product is good."
positive,Great for HDD to SSD: This was exactly what I needed to migrate from my Laptop's HDD to the SSD. It was very easy and the only thing that I would have liked was more control over what I could copy versus just the Document folders
positive,"Not The Best But.....: This CD Is well built in ways but some songs need help but overall the CD is a B+ because of two songs ""U Remind Me"" And "" U got it bad"". I'm not saying that those are the only good songs on the CD I'm just saying that is what makes the CD well built. Here is my rewiew on each song.""U Remind Me""- My 3rd favorite song on the CD and that tells you that it will be at least one more single on the CD.I Don't Know- Not a bad song but it is not Usher's styleU Got it Bad- My favorite song on the CD (maybe a single)U-Turn- My 2nd favorite song on the CD good dance party songHottest Thing- My 4th Favorite song on the CD (nice song)If I want to - Good BeatTwork it Out- Good songGood Ol' Ghetto- Ok songU R The one - I like this songU don't have to call- Single MaterialI can't let U go- All of it is goodCan U help me - Other Favorite on this CDHow do I say- Good song"
positive,Best Ever: Crazy thin! I see why they are so highly recommended. Feels like nothing was there at all. I will recommend these to all of my friends
negative,"Sound is defective: When I try to watch this, I have to turn the sound on my TV all the way up to hear it and even then it's still too low. Some parts are better than others, but I was not pleased with the sound recording quality."
positive,"Truly unique movie with outstanding acting and photography: I first saw this film as part of an in-flight entertainment and was immediately captivated by it. Outstanding acting by giants Spacey and Bridges combine with an intelligent script and masterful photography (cinematographer John Mathieson also worked on ""Hannibal"" and ""Gladiator"") to create a unique piece of art that refuses to be easily categorized into any genre.It offers a thought-provoking insight into modern society and the human condition in general.The DVD is con-genial with a reference-quality image and excellent, if somewhat subtle, sound.The black-and-white ""making of"" photographs by Jeff Brigdes himself, found in a little gallery in the ""special features"" section, are truly remarkable. Too bad there are only a handful on display.Watch the end credits all the way for a neat little ""dessert"" afterwards :-)"
positive,"My all time favorite: Im only 16 but I've read many books and the only one that I could even compare to Dune would have to be The Lord of Rings. I just recently completed the entire Dune series and It was the best written most indepth writing I have ever come across. Frank Herbert creates an entire universe here; an economic structure, a political structure, an entire enviornment so completely different from our own. This is a definate must for readers of any taste."
negative,Purchased twice-never worked: My 4 year old used his piggy bank money to purchas this toy. We could not get the mouth to chomp down no matter how many teeth we pushed in any order. We returned it for a new one from a different seller& had the same problem. Very disappointed.
positive,All the King's Men on CD Unabridged: Superior product; arrived on time & too bad the movie was so effective.
negative,"BEWARE: uSED THE MACH 3 FOR YEARS, SWITCH UP THE M5 BLADE...WORST MISTAKE..OVER ENGINEERED THE BLADEDS CLOG UP...DO NOT BUY"
positive,"Excellent resource: I have this book. While I have not taken the ASVAB, what I've seen of the samples in the book would indicate that criticism about incorrect answers is false. And I'm a pretty good test-taker.Wiley has elevated their Dummies books by making their contents as accurate as possible. That is why Dummies books are used as classroom resources across the country and why I also use them when I need to get up to speed quickly, accurately and without unnecessary information."
negative,"UNABLE TO RATE BECAUSE...: AFTER ORDERING THIS BOOK, WAS ADVISED THE SELLER HAD INSPECTED IT AND FOUND THAT SECTIONS OF IT WERE DAMAGED/MISSING SO...THEY DID NOT SEND IT AND REFUNDED MY CREDIT CARD PAYMENT.SINCE THE FIRST AND SECOND BOOK OF THIS AUTHOR'S SERIES IS UNAVAILABLE (OR PRICED TO SELL TO VERY SERIOUS COLLECTORS ONLY-- READ: EXORBITANT) I PROBABLY WON'T EVER GET TO READ THEM.ANYWAY, I SHOULD BE HAPPY I DID NOT RECEIVE A DEFECTIVE BOOK AFTER PAYING FOR IT!"
positive,"Love my Dirty Dancing DVD: This limited edition Dirty Dancing Keepsake DVD collection is a must for all fans of this movie. It has not only the movie but lots of additional footage, interviews, and even screen tests of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey."
negative,"Another Disappointment: Grisham is off on another political tirade. He starts off developing a decent plot and then abandons it. He gets off on an anti-Vietnam crusade extolling the virtues of running off to Canada. He focuses on his relationship with a matriarch which, again, diverts from the story line. He treats the solving of final crimes as an afterthought. Grisham has clearly lost it. Where he once wove a tale that meshed from beginning to end, he now appears on an ego trip to stuff his political predjuces down the readers throat at the expense of whatever plot he initiated. I was also disappointed with The King Of Torts for many of the same reasons. This was the last book by him that I shall read."
positive,"ALUTA CONTINUA - VICTORIA ASCERTIA!!!: yeah the struggle continues, victory is certain.. it's not quite surprising that even though this guy went to some of the best schools, he still has to face the same circumstances the average black man on the street faces... it's obvious from Jett's account that a lot of racial prejudice still exists in this country."
negative,Better off shouting loudly: Ths phone is terrible. It's impossible to hear--either too loud with dreadful echoes or painfully soft. Not worth the bargain price for which I bought it.
negative,Eli's the king: I think that this book was very weak.There should of been more killing.I also think that lennie did the right thing by killing the girl at the end.The book wasn't very good.To much swearing.
negative,"No go: I did not like this one. It is a bit large and it has a plastic, rubbery smell that never goes away. It's also slightly loud. I have had similar toys before and I like this one the least."
positive,"I learned a lot about Menopause!: I was very plesantly surprised by this video and I learned a lot about peri-menopause and menopause itself, what to eat, what to do to help relieve symptoms, etc... it's extremely detailed and friendly.The 3 workout segments are basic and short at 20 min. each - I liked the strenght workout the best. These shorter milder workouts are good for a day when I feel tired but want to do something good for my body.Well done Kathy and thank you for talking about menopause!"
negative,"Dissapointed: I bought these slippers when Amazon had them for less than $15, so I probably shouldn't complain, BUT... First, the size is quite small. I wear a 10 and ordered a 10 and an 11, based apon others reviews. The 11 BARELY fits, and I can feel my toes bumping against the ends of the slippers when I walk.As far as quality goes, the slippers do look nice, but unlike other similar slippers I've owned (and paid a lot more for) there is little to no cushioning inside the shoes. I'm not just referring to the cushioning between your feet and the floor, but between your feet and the seams where the sole is sewn onto the bottom. I can feel the pronounced ridges of the seams all the way around the bottom of my foot, and they make standing in the slippers for more than a moment or two quite painful. If the slippers were bigger, maybe I wouldn't feel it, but I finally had to put in a pair of insoles, which did help a bit. All in all, I'm pretty dissapointed."
positive,"Good pot for the price - heavy: It's a good pot but it's pretty heavy. It also makes some kindof weird noise when it's boiling, but everything seems fine. It was cheap and gets the job done."
negative,"Couldn't use it: After adjusting the leg pieces for several days (wearing socks & boots)and then even replacing these with foam rolls I still cannot prevent the ankle strain when using this product, even at a 45degree incline. I know somebody else who has one and they like it so I guess it depends on the person, I am not heavy for my size and never thought this would be an issue."
negative,"LOOSING HER TOUCH..: Jean Auel started out with an exciting story of Ayla, but threw the series, she slowly either lost interest or just forgot how to write. She is loosing her followers, who have watched Ayla grow. All hopes for Ayla to return someday, and find her son Derk are all but lost, as the books become more boring and seem to only fill pages with gibberish. The #6 book in the series is not out yet, but I think I will read threw the pages before I buy it, to see if its worth the purchase."
positive,High Quality Hot Beverage Holder: These cups are easy to clean and drink from. the color is excellent.A worthy addition to your home.
negative,Bad..: I dont really know how good they work because they expire in only a month!!! I wasnt going to use theese untill later on this summer! How can a product like this expirse only in 2 months!!
positive,"A Classic: After a visit to Monterey & Cannery Row, I found this novel to be even more relevant than the first time I read it almost 50 years ago.The character development was well done & the fact that many of them were based on real people (if not all) made the novel true to the real life & events on this iconic street during its hayday."
positive,"Comprehensive View of a Master: While I personally don't like ALL of Moore's work (the Piazza Del Italia's too gaudy for me), this book presents a strong case for his elevation to Master. A very comprehensive survey of his works, it relies mostly on photos & illustrations, with some text. From Sea Ranch to Kresge College, everything's here. Pick it up in conjunction with his memoirs (often available on remainder tables) & you have a really good set!"
positive,The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin: Nicely done with good history and anecdotes. A way to find out about the workings of the man and his times.
positive,"Good read: Hadn't read this since i was a kid, decent read, although the story/adventure is lacking at a few moments. If you are reading this after watching the movie, please note the movie, only covers roughly the first 100 pages and a lot was added/changed from the book."
positive,"Great product: It works just great with a beefed up computer, about twice the RAM of the suggested. Easy setup, but the software that comes with the program is hard to use and not worth bothering with. If you want a very simple, easy to use and effective editing program, use Windows Movie Maker which comes with a Windows XP update."
negative,Our unexpected wasted time: I am a very big Maureen McKade Fan . I have got 2 of every book that she has . I waited so long to read this one . But when I got it I sat down to read it and I have to say I was crying at the end becuse it was so painful to read . It was a very disapointing night . This is one book that I will not be keeping :-( It was very laging in many areas . Along with unbelivable . I am usally able to loose my self in her books and forget any kind of day the world has put me threw but not this one. You know it a great book if you laugh and rut on the people in it but this one you sipmly can not.
positive,"Very good as 'Phone' (Cheap & works fine): I got new apple 3g .. That was my biggest disappointment. So Returned it and got this phone. This is pretty cheap and almost for free. This phone doesn't have hi-tech functionality like you-tube, bluetooth etc. Internet browsing i didn't try but who cares... you have to keep in mind that this phone is just for basic purpose.Signal quality is excellent. I get bars even every one are having 'no signals', very light weight and very good battery life. What else you are expecting as a 'phone'drawbacks : no bluetooth but getting handsfree wire device is also getting rare because of marketing techniques. Also I miss volume control buttons on side.but overall I am very happy and dropped all plans to buy any other phone"
negative,"Oprah's next pick: ""Schmaltzy and vacuous"" pretty much covers it, though one might also add that this novel consistently attempts to pass off conventional wisdom as insight and panders to the lowest literary common denominator while trying, through understatement, to pass itself off as art. Should sell a million copies-- look for it as Oprah's next pick."
positive,"Quite good, though sometimes farfetched.: I love the writing. I love the books. I just sometimes find it a bit strange that the mysteries from Québec *always* link back to North or South Carolina. But I have to say I'm glad, as Pat Conroy was the only person writing mainstream fiction set in that neck of the woods.The sense of place in these stories is remarkable, with just the right evocative details. The characters are finely-drawn and the plotting is rock-solid. The tension is just perfect. I recently buzzed right through my first two Reichs books with a great deal of pleasure. A very good read indeed.As a side note, I was a bit startled to find *myself* in this book. I've used the name Ivy Lee online for years, and I lived, until quite recently, near Beaufort, SC. That minor character was a bit of fun that made me wonder over and over if I knew Ms Reichs online! Just coincidence, I'm sure.Thanks for a brilliant bit of entertainment!"
positive,"a highly practical teaching and preaching resource: This is not your typical verse by verse exegetical commentary. While it goes deep enough to satisfy your intellectual appetite, it really is more focused on giving you a resource for teaching and preaching, rather than giving you ammunition for your next doctoral thesis. In other words, it is highly practical and written for the average reader. This does not mean that serious students have nothing to gain from it. Far from it. But the goal of most students is to eventually be able to better share their faith with others and this commentary could be a very useful tool in that respect.Before many sections of the book there is a ""Preaching Focus"", and what would normally be called exegetical notes are called ""Notes for Preaching and Teaching."" There are introductions to important sections and there are also helpful notes at the end of several sections. All in all, a very practical teaching resource organized in verse by verse commentary form."
negative,"Worst yet!: Amazingly silly dance routines. Baaaad acting. Lame, lame, lame story (I particularly love how the meteorite happens to land right next Peter and Mary Jane while making-out on a giant self-made web). And all for a mere $60 retail. Thank god for Amazon! If you're into this sort of thing that is. Don't let the effects dazzel your brain, this is truely one of the worst comic book movies, yet. And it's Spiderman, how can you screw that up."
negative,""" HELP ME!"": ""This book was very boring. I had to read this book for a cause. If I could have choose another book I would have sais 'OKAY! ANYTIME, ANYDAY!!!' I say this because I thought it would get better in the end, but instead it got very boring."
negative,Ic.: It's very boring.All other movies nominated in the Academy Award for the Best Picture are better than this one.
negative,"Rachel Weisz is fantastic but the movie itself is shallow and empty.: Shallow and empty horror movie that manages to lower your I.Q. while you are watching it with a flat out horrible performance by Keanu Reeves, who manages to make his matrix performances look Oscar worthy by comparison. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence lacks passion for the material and not to mention professionalism and the script is by far the most offensive thing in the entire film with a very confusing story line that does not make much sense and some pretty incredible bad dialog. My heart goes out to some of the good actors in this film, who does bring their amazing talent to this waste of celluloid especially Rachel Weisz, who manages to overcome the very bad script to give a tight and powerful performance that the movie clearly does not deserved. The one star in this review goes to her for her valiant effort to give a good performance despite the horrible script and her retarded leading man."
positive,"Buy This And Give It to Teachers For Xmas!: What do you want it to say on your tombstone? A,B,C priorities. Get more accomplished by compartmentalizing your tasks. Write a letter to someone far away like a diary entry over several days! That is what I learned to do after reading this book. Leant out first copy, never got it back! Thanks Carmenza! Anyone wanting to increase their potential needs this book as a primer. Remember if I bought it here it was because it was a standout in my life!"
positive,"wonderful product: This helps keep the baby swaddled and cozy. My 2 month old sleeps much longer in this product. The fabric is thin enough that the baby doesn't get all sweaty as with the thicker fabric offered.Weird but cute comment: With this color and print, when the baby wiggles he looks like a catapiller with a human head. That provides much laughter at my house."
positive,"Excellent Ski Tours for the Western Sierra: This book has 59 tours in the Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Park areas and around Huntington Lake. Describes some beautiful country. Each tour is rated with difficulty, length, elevatnion, navigation, time, and season. The USGS topos for the tour are listed, along with excellent tour maps. Each tour has a description of what you see, where to start, and leads you thorough the tour.I like the book, but I would also like to see an index and more tours for the Yosemite high country."
positive,"AWESOME action, but NOT good dialog!!!: I love the way the action sequences are repeated in slow motion so as to get every angle of the stunt. The dialog, at times, fell a little short of having any meaning to it. But with that said, NOT many movies DO have meaningful dialog, I didn't punish it for that either. Overall, this movie is very exciting and if you like action movies then...WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THIS ONE YET? It is action packed!!! NOT nearly as bad as others have said."
positive,"A Boy Who Finds a Dog: I think kids would like the book, Shiloh, by Phillois Reynolds Naylor because it is fun, and adventurous. I ike this story because a boy named Marty finds a dog and he named it Shiloh because he found the dog by the Shiloh School Houes. Marty finds out that it is Judd's dog. One day he had to take the dog back to Judd which makes Marty feel very worried aboutShiloh's safety. I think you would like this story because it is Judd's dog and he is mean. You will have to read the rest of the story to find the ending.(...)"
negative,"Living Landscapes Bali HD DVD: I bought it. Too bad we can't view it. NONE of the computers, laptops, portable players or televisions the family and extended family own will open the program."
positive,"Good, Almost Great.: The interviews are ace and remarkable in their clarity and insight. These are let down by the lack of context as to the battle within the wider campaign and a map or two would have enabled the reader to see the landscape and the positions, both would have added to the understanding of the action taken by each of the medal winners. Another example is the cover photo, listed as US Army coming ashore on Tinian Island in the Pacific Islands, which is sort of correct but Tinian is one of the northern Mariana islands (next to Sapian which was a major Marine victory) and was the home of the 509th Bomb Group which lead the atomic raids on Japan, a small detail yet one that would context this good book even better."
positive,"5 full-on hits: There are 5 totally rocking tracks on this disk (the last 9 are kinda generic).The good tracks are simply as good as indie rock gets: extremely catchy, stick in your brain hard rock. Great for before you surf, snowboard or skate. Based on how good these good tracks are, I'll give it my favorite album of the year award.Like most bands, buy all their albums and make your own compilation disk."
negative,"Blow lives up to the name...: Blow is a long, boring true life-based tale of a drug dealer's life. Blow is a classic story: boy gets easy money from dealing, dealing turns bad, boy gets busted, boy looses everything, boy tries to regain life, but blows it. Buy Traffic."
negative,"HP PhotoSmart 2575 scanner makes noise: I had a previous model similar to the HP 2575 which lasted for 2 years with alot of use. However, after purchasing this model on Sept 21, 2006 and using it for barely 2 months the scanner mode is now squeaking and sounds horrible. This is the same noise the prior version did right before it quit. I agree that HP support is completely worthless - that's if you can even get them to understand what your problem is since it may not be in their ""manual"".Anyone have a suggestion on a decent brand that will do incredible scans of old photos and not fail in the first two years??"
positive,"asking for an information: Hi ,We are running a pub here iN Marmaris Turkey.Since long time we are looking for the production place on lite ice cubes to import here to Turkey to sale.If you would like to make business with us to sale this product here in Turkey to the clubs please ,inform us about the details...If you do not prefer to make business together would you help us where to find the production center of this product in china or in Europe...Thank youSincerelYBar SoydanZulal UyAnik"
positive,"A Taste of David Copperfield: This version of David Copperfield was done as a miniseries for TV. While it gives us a decided flavor of Charles Dicken's rich characterizations, it leaves some important characters behind. This is necessary, in part, due to the enormous length of the original work. Still, when I used it in my English classes, it helped high school students with learning disabilities to visualize the historical climate and serves as a springboard for reading chapters from the novel and discussion. Student comments were positive for overall enjoyment of the movie. For those interested in the actors, the cast is not only recognizable, but accomplished. You will be delighted at some of the portrayals!"
negative,"This movie was terrible: This movie is so bad. It does not stand the test of time. I saw it decades ago when I was young and idealistic. I think kids today would laugh at it. I actually rented it because my son is in law school and I thought it would be fun to see how life in the 70's compared to life in 2011. Lame, I tell you, Lame.............."
positive,"Great Book: I had to purchase this book for my freshman english class, as I was required to read the whole text (14 chapters) and answer the 5 questions after each chapter for the final. This book suprisingly wasn't a burden to read as it's very small but packed with useful tips on how to improve your study skills and habits. I read the entire book and answered the questions (70 in total) after each chapter in a matter of 2 days. I already had very good study skills and habits (3.3 overall g.p.a. after my freshman year) but this book still gave me various ways of how to improve those and even brought to my knowledge things I did that I didn't even know was helping me study. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone that attends school starting from middle school and up to even people just looking to improve their overall studying."
positive,"Great Option for the Yamaha Receiver: The concept of the IPOD dock is simply great. I was surprised to learn that it is an available option AFTER we bought the receiver. It's such an important accessory, that one would think the Yamaha marketing folks would have included it in the point of sale materials. Go figure.Anyway, it is simple to install and easy to use. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an IPOD.Playing music from the IPOD is certainly easier than selecting CD's to play and then inserting them into a CD changer.Now that we have the IPOD dock, we may no longer need to have a multi-CD /DVD player. When it comes time to upgrade to a Blue-ray, we may only need the single CD/DVD player which will $ave a few shekels."
positive,Pictures not illustrations: If you are looking for a practical guide to identifying the trees found North of Maryland and as far West as the Great Lakes you should add this book to your library. It is a gem. Even if your focus is in other regions Levinsons methods are practical guidance for the amateur. One comment I would make is about the claim to be an illustrated text. The transcribers note that they replaced the original woodcuts with arbitrary photos of trees or parts of trees. Hence a figure titled Pitch Pine Twig is clearly not pitch pine. Notwithstamding this peculiarity I still rate it at 5 for the merits of Levinsons work and the otherwise high quality of the trancription.
negative,"piece of junk!: Don't waste your money. This is the worst printer I have ever owned. If this is an indication of other HP products, no wonder HP stock is tanking. Paper doesn't feed, display screen doesn't work, error light blinks continuously.I'm taking this into the back yard and going ""office Space"" on it."
positive,"Close to perfect: As always listening to his voice gives me chills! Its not his fault,but I could only give him a 4 out of 5. The producers and song writers stole the other point. Clay is so talented. He has proven over and over he can sing any song...so why dont the producers and song writers give him better material? Some of the songs are a little on the ""bubblegum"" side. Clay is a grown man and needs more grown up songs. The last thing I want for him is to see him not taken seriously because he is being produced for a quick dollar with the teen generation. He is too good for that. He needs some songs that are going to get airplay on adult stations. I would have liked some soft rock songs. ""No more sad song"" and ""Perfect Day"" just might make it. Dont take this as a bad review...on the contrary I would recommend it to everyone. I have not put it down since I got it the day of release. Its worth the money and aside from the few bubblegum songs the CD is great!"
negative,"Well engineered, awful coffee: We have the B77. Did everything we could think of to ensure a good tasting cup of coffee. Flushed the system, used bottled water, different brews from different suppliers. Could not, no matter what we tried, get a cup of coffee that was not bitter or sour. It's going back."
negative,"How Bad Does it Get!: This book I would not advise anyone to read! For 3 chapter they just talk about a stinkin stump! Who cares about a stupid stump. I mean I get that it's symbolic and everything, but the author definetely could have had some way of making this book more interesting. There is almost no action throughout the book until the last few chapter because the whole book is centered around how a cowboy stays on a farm and a kid's perspective of the story. A few of the chapters were just dialogue about absolutely nothing. And how much do we really to know about the cowboy anyways! If you want a book with good symbolism and connotation with still some action you should read The Giver. Overall, one a scale of 1 to 10, this book is a -1! The only thing that saved it from a -50 is the last few chapters in which they have some fight scenes. This book will be a waste of your time, so don't buy it!"
positive,"AWSOME!!: This Movie is Great. I loved it. sure there are some stupid jokes, and the CGI of the Scorpian King STUNK!!!...but I loved the story line. I've watched this film 3 times and I loved it all three times. So please people, stop womping on it. this movie rocks!"
negative,Problem playing disk: It would have received five stars had I been able to play the first side of disk #1. Something wrong with the disk and apparently pervasive - a replacement disk didn't work either.
negative,"Poor Qality: First of all the discs are copies, not originals. The sound cuts in and out and the picture is grainy looking. I am unable to watch it and I did not get a packing slip in the box with the DVD, so I guess I can't return it."
negative,"Pure BS: Ralph Lamb was no hero. He and much of his family were corrupt to the core, even a member of his own Mormon religion said that. Further he was never responsible for getting rid of the mob in Vegas, that was done by the feds. Lamb and the Metropolitan Police Dept were considered so corrupt that the US Attorney and FBI wouldn't even share information with them."
positive,great: It was a good movie for sci fi people who have already seen the stargate series. came to our house quickly
positive,"Seems like a nice pair of boots.: I have only wore these boots a couple of times, so I may be reviewing them too soon. As other reviewers have stated they don't seem to need a break in period, but there is a certain ""learning"" period. I say this as a person who literally has worn nothing but tennis shoes for years. The learning is getting used to the extra weight and bulk on your feet. I bought these to be a part of my ""bug out"" plan. I will soon be going on a real hike on rougher terrain to see how they feel then. Plus until I have put many more mile on them to see how they hold up I can't say for sure how many stars they deserve. I give them 4 for now and assuming 200-300 miles from now they are still in good shape I would change it to 5."
negative,"I hate it: After reading the book and having the pleasure of meeting the authors in Missouri, all I can say...nothing new here. If you consider ripping off existing fly patterns revolutionary...go ahead, buy the book. Buy some Tony Accardo flies and poppers and take your hat off to a true master."
positive,"Brilliant!: Though there may have been a few slight annoyances about this book (Dr. Marchmont, Edgar's suspicious nature), for the most part, it was highly readable and very well-written. The Eugenia subplot was fascinating and the characters were well-rounded and interesting (especially Sir Sedley Clarendel, who I thought showed a lot of potential, and who was much more than the fop he appeared to be). I should warn you (especially everybody new to Burney)that it starts fairly slowly, but the plot really picks up a couple hundred pages in. There were several times that I got so into reading it (especially the last 200 pages) that I ignored homework or other things that I was expected to do. Altogether, I highly recommend Camilla to anyone who wants to read something engaging, entertaining and different."
positive,"excellent: I bought the 1999 version and am about to order the newest edition. I had not been to Disney World in 12 years so I had no idea on what to do and where do go. The book was right on about every detail. I especially like the ride advice for little ones and the hotel recommendations. If you are planning a trip, buy this book first!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"Very Dark: Other reviewers have covered the content. So I'll share our experience reading this series as a family. My 9 year old liked it. The prose and plots held the adults' attention. But with time, we felt the series was kind of oppressive. There's very little joy or positive energy in these books. The cats spend most of their time on the defensive, getting hurt. And because it is a series, there's a lot of rehashing between books. I also noticed that my child hasn't asked to read any of the author's other series. Instead, my child is now reading the Chronicles of Ancient Darkness series."
negative,"A lot of potential, but does not meet expectations...: I have had the DSM-320 for six months. It does NOT play DIVX (only some XVIDs with the audio out of sync), but the radio functionality is great!Firmware updtates are done every fifth to seventh year, so don't buy this mediaplyer in expectation of having a working product in the near future. It has still got more bugs than an African youth hostel. If you need AOL radio it is a great buy, but for anything else it is slooooooow, unreliable and very, very annoying...Check out this forum before you buy it: //p214.ezboard.com/fdsm320frm13"
positive,"Cake Craft & Decoration: Please send me Cake Craft & Decoration, begin by March 2006 issue.ThanksDiana"
positive,"Ever so Wild: Two of Frankie Laine's great albums with Johnny Williams are reissued on one disc- to excellent effect! Although the arrangements and style of these 60s albums resemble Laine's and William's work on ""Hell Bent for Leather,"" in this case the songs are not cowboy songs, but, in the case of ""Dueces Wild,"" gambling songs, and, in the case of ""The Call of the Wild,"" klondike-adventure songs. No popular singer has ever explored this rough and ready terrain with Frankie Laine's success, and it's a thrill to hear him charge through such masculine songs as ""Call of the Wild"" and ""Roving Gambler."" Even songs that had proved major hits for other artists are remade in Laine's image: Johnny Horton's ""North to Alaska"" comes to mind. Some may find these selections and arrangements trite and old-fashioned- and they are- but the sheer strength and passion exhibited here is hard to dislike."
negative,"Diane Arbus in Cinematic Hell: ""Fur"" takes the fascinating subject of Diane Arbus and trashes it. Ignoring Patricia Bosworth's 1984 biography, director Steven Shainberg and screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson opt for a pretentious fictional approach. With a running time of 122 minutes, ""Fur"" goes nowhere very slowly. Nicole Kidman's fine performance as the influential photographer deserves a much better film."
negative,"HALLOWEEN?????: This isn't a Halloween film and the plot was absolutely horrible, this film should get one star instead of two."
positive,"Another great book by Irving Stone!: I think I'll just have to read them all. Irving Stone is one of our best contemporary writers. Read his The Agony and the Ecstasy, too, another great artistic biography. He makes us feel Van Gogh's angst, his struggle to express himself creatively, to hone his craft, to function in society. His infamous heartbreaks. The love and long-distance support of his brother. It's a truly poignant portrait of an artist - set in a spectacularly beautiful world."
positive,"Oh, my! Absolutely wonderful.: As a person with brain damage, I felt like I knew the author, and she knew me. I was touched by finding that another person shared my difficulties and view of the world. This new world can be a terribly frightening and lonely place.Patricia Long faced the challenges, sometimes feeling defeated, but ultimately with a strenght of character that has brought her to a new level she never thought she had in her.Patricia had traumatic brain injury. Mine is acquired and worsening daily. I don't have the ability to get better, but the book was still a great encouragement. I learned some new ways of coping.This book was recommended by my cognitive therapist.And, yes, it took me a half hour, with many corrections, to write this."
negative,"One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read, Don't Waste Your Time: I was so excited to see a new book on Frederick Douglass I didn't take time to preview the book. A classic mistake. The book is full of assumptions and innuendo. It seems the author was trying to destroy Frederick Douglass' place in history. There were too many insulting statements based on little or no fact. I tried to keep an open mind while reading the book, but the more I read the more disgusted I became. What the author may consider conservative and controversial; I consider a racist piece of trash."
negative,Sesame Street Kids Favorite Songs 2: I hated this video. The favorite songs #1 is great. My 9 month old daughter loves it. What a disapointment the second one was. They don't have enough of the Sesame Street characters in it. It's a lot of clips of kids talking and singing and bad cartoons.
positive,"School Assignment: I would recommened this book for anyone ages 13 and up. It's a hard read, but has a strong theme and interesting characters. I enjoyed the whole book until the ending. I didn't like the ending because it was a little bit confusing and sad. Besides that I enjoyed this science-fiction which has a strong resemblence to the Giver by Lois Lowry."
negative,"Who, Which, Where??: There have been more than dozen productions of this piece made available on LP/tape/CD. Which one is this?? If it's the most recent London revival, it's lame. If it's the New York original cast with Elly Stone, it's priceless.What have we here??"
negative,"Very Disappointed: I ordered this dvd on December 1st. I had no idea it was coming from ITALY. It was to be a Christmas present, but I received it January 15th. The cover and all writing is in Italian! The worst thing is that it will not play on the dvd player, or the x-box. It will play in the laptop. It says this dvd is only available for viewing in Italy and a bunch of other foreign countries nowhere near here. I ordered it from Utah, you would think they could send it here and it would play. I have never heard of such a thing. I can't send it back because it had to go back to Italy and I will not deal with that overseas mailing hassle. This has been a nightmare and I feel Amazon shouldn't work with 3rd parties like these people. I like to order from Amazon. You can see that I have a long history and have ordered many things from Amazon. First disappointment. Please check into these vendors and do not associate with them."
positive,AWESOME!!: Is this really Ms. Spencer's first novel? This was an outstanding read. I had to remember at times that this was being written by a woman. She did a wonderful job with the writing and with all of the characters. We got to know the characters without them becoming to boring or getting too much information on them. What an ending too!! I am anxiously awaiting her next book. Much success and blessings in all your endeavors. Peace!!
positive,"excellent!: not a huge fan of Mia Farrow but she was EXCELLENT in this! this film centers around her and her husband who live in an old apartment building in NYC and theyre trying to have a baby. They have a few problems with a nosy old couple who turn out to be witches after their baby, and it turns out the husband was in it all along. no one believes her when she suspects these people, so they are all against her. i dont want to tell you the end, that would spoil it, LOL i know its fiction but the only thing i have a problem with the film is the fact that witches are always being portrayed as evil, and they are not...i guess alot of films would not have been made if they didnt believe that."
negative,"One of the worst books I've read in years.: This is just another of the low quality books put out under the ""Tom Clancy"" name.The book is written by Jerome Preisler and is by far one of the worst books I've read in some time.The plot is very poorly defined, and is so poorly followed that 1/2 the time you are left trying to figure out how a chapter fit into the rest of the book.Character development was minimal at best, and completely missing at worst.There were two main plot lines that had virtually nothing to do with each other, and trying to follow them simply made the book unreadable.My advice is that you don't waste your time on this sell out of a ""Tom Clancy"" novel."
negative,"Bad Tudor Porn: If OK magazine and Penthouse had been writing in the 1500's this is what they would have come up with.First, it is a badly written book. It is essentially bad Tudor porn. No characters are well written, and they are all insufferable. Honestly they couldn't behead Anne fast enough for me. Even Mary, who should have been the heroine/likeable one was a winy, annoying character.Second, if you're going to make it up just call it fiction and don't try to pass it off as history. Do some basic research. If I can refute the basic ""facts"" of your book in 5 minutes with Google, it's not history in any sense of the word.This book does not deserve to be a best seller, she does not deserve to be identified as an historical fiction writer. I look at author recommendations on books, and if she recommends it I put it down and move on."
negative,"This Movie isnt a tribute to anyone: A Poor Excuse for a film.Due to the fact nothing happens in the film, example, He walks in the room, looks around the room, finds cereal, makes the cereal, eats the cereal, and we sit through a 10 minute scene and get nothing back.I am a huge fan of Asia Argento and she couldent even save this film from the trash bin."
negative,dishonest: Unscholarly would be too nice a term for this book. It is intellectually dishonest. Non-academic propoganda. I would rate it a zero if I could. Enough said.
negative,wait till you hear the real thing: There is no comparison between this and other Nosferatu albums and Bernard J Taylor's masterpiece. Save your money.
positive,Classic novel by a great authoe: Loved it every time I read this super novel. Will read it again and again. One of my favorite books of all time. The classics always stand the test of time.
negative,"Why all the fuss: Contravery! Where? I didn't see any! Real low budget! I loved how they made such a fuss on the cover, tricked me into buying it! A waste of a movie."
positive,"This is a Very Good Book Indeed.: This is one of the best written books I have had the opportunity to read. Those of you who gave it a 1 are ignorant. And dont worry Sheri, he wont be writting anymore books seeing as how he has been dead for a while now. Before you criticize the writing of a wonderful author please learn how to spell correctly.1984 is a wonderful trip into the human mind and it shows how those of us in charge can and will do anything to remain in charge. It is a very good follow-up to Animal Farm. They both describe power hungry and greedy people can go to extreme measures to keep that power.Those who said the government would never end up like this are fooling yourself. The future could very easily end up like this. With the formation of the ""Homeland Security"" it is becoming even more likely that this may well be the future of the world. (Of course thank goodness 1984 wasnt really like that)"
negative,"Historically inaccurate, highly suspect.A Roger Corman film.: While this movie touches on some of the truths regarding Manfred ""the Red Baron"" von Richthofen and Roy Brown, the man who supposedly shot him down, it makes up 90% of it's material from popular tripe and the sensationalistic journalism of the era. If you have any interest in Manfred von Richthofen, or the truth, rent The Red Baron (1988 Queststar) instead."
positive,"Good solution for people with weird shaped ears.: All I have read about these was pretty much true. You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need."
negative,"mainstream press fails to understand comics,,,,,: This was a cheap and really look down approach to comic books and superheroes in general. The History Channel does not make good production films anymore on any subject, it comes off more as something expensive and cheap you would buy at a mall. I'm hopeful that one day soon, a more in depth film will be made on the history of comic books and superheroes in general, but this trash was not it."
positive,"real life saver: I received this book from my ex-wife just after our divorce. At first I thought it was a crule joke. But after reading the life 101 book I realized that she could have given me A great gift.. Like the book states, Not all parts will pertain to you at this time, but it is a wonderful refference for later... I have purchased at least 15 of these books. and given them all away.. I usually buy one for myself and start rereading it when someone will say something that relates to a chapter in the book and I point it out to them and the next thing you know there goes another book... at this price it is easy to give them away... MR BILL"
negative,"Disappointed: I bought this book because the synopsis sounded good and because I knew John Grisham had a reputation of being a great author of suspense novels. This book was ok, but just ok. There wasn't any suspense that I could see, and it wasn't the type of book I couldn't put down. It was just a nice little tale of a town and it's people. Not a typical Grisham novel."
positive,"True Crime: This box set includes The French Connection I & II. The original is of course the most well known of the two. The movie is based off the true events of the biggest heroin bust in history.The story follows two of NYPD's narcotics detectives as they stumble onto a hunch which turns into a huge multi-jurisdictional case. Detective Doyle who is played by Gene Hackman, was one of the NYPD's most decorated officers when he retired. The two detectives build their case and eventually narrow their search of suspects before finally getting the approval of the upper brass to make an arrest. This is a great crime drama which follows the original novel and the true story really well.Part II of the set picks up where part I ends. What most people don't know is that part II did not actually happen. Part II is complete fiction while part I is a true story. Great film!"
positive,"Magnificent!: This cd is absolutely wonderful! Madonna is the best Evita out there! Compared to Patti LuPone and Julie Covington she is the only one who can actually sing! Unlike Mandy Patinki, Antonio Banderas brings emotion and power to his singing. His voice is strong but can also be soft when it should be. After listening to this cd, I am glad they did cut out certain lyrics and replaced them. Some of the lyrics from the old Evitas are too direct. Jonathan Pryce may not be the best singer on this cd, but at least his voice doesn't make you cover your ears every time he comes on. He fits the part very well if you knew anything about the real Evita and Juan Peron. Jimmy Nail is also a good singer, although unfortunately he is only in 3 tracks. This cd is absolutely gggrrreeeaaattt!!!! They tried and they were more than 100% succesful!!!"
negative,I hated this book.: I really hated this book.In two different stints as a member of the Military Book Club it is the only book I ever sent back.
negative,"shelters of stone: Like so many others, I was anxious to read Jean Auel's new book. How very disappointing. Where oh where was the editor? It wasn't just the repetitions from previous books; but repetitions from 3 pages back that were jarring. If you've enjoyed this series, skip this book and see if she can do any better on the next one."
negative,"If you like Tozer, you won't like this!: This is man-worship at its most blatant! The Tozer quotes are good, of course, but they are much better read in their context. The compiler's have seen a way to make a quick buck on Tozer's popularity and the page titles are crass, tasteless and irrelevant. The Bible verses that are supposed to associate with each quote bear little relevance, and add nothing to the quote. This is a waste of money at any price! We find on the back that this booklet is part of a series. Others in the series include Moody, Wesley, Luther, and ... Larry Burkett (whoever HE is!) Please save your money and time. This one ended up straight in the bin. To me it is worse than pure secularism and borders on blasphemy! It's sick!"
negative,"Material is very thin: Material is too thin to look nice. When the sun is shining, you can't even see the design. Seems to be nicely constructed otherwise, but just doesn't look that nice."
positive,Loved this book!!!: It was a wonderful well written Book!!! I have read many of Julie Garwood books and I love them all. This was one of my first that I read of hers and I loved it!!!
positive,"Mind opening: This movie makes you enter the human's brain like no other. And not just the main character's brain, but yours. Worth the trip if you want to know what one (anyone) is made of, whether you like it or not. A masterpiece in terms of film making, too. It will not leave you indifferent."
negative,Lodge Book: For the price of the book I was looking for more recipes not a history of cast iron cooking. Not worth the price
positive,"Baldwin and Sheridan in LOST TREASURE: Although the film steals its opening sequence footage from Backdraft, it is still a fun way to kill a couple of hours. Stephen Baldwin is likeable in the lead role and Sheridan looks great as usual. Not as bad as most say."
positive,"Little Women: Little Women is a wonderful book for all ages. No matter how old you are, or whether you are a male or female, there is something in there for you. So pick it up and get ready for a wonderful trip through the minds of 4 girls and their mother during the war, and listen to their tough, fun, and rough times! I guarantee you a wonderful read!"
negative,"Not Great: If you need accurate, repeatable measurements, you will probably want to look somewhere else. It does not inspire confidence when you zero your caliper and it will not even repeat the measurement of zero. I would trust this for a good ballpark measurement but that is not really the level of accuracy required when I reach for a caliper."
positive,"Prince Caspian: With More Action and Violence in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian I would say this is one of the best Narnia Movies I have seen. I do wish it had more of adventure like the first movie.About 85% of the movie was one big battle. It doesn't beat The ""Lord of The Rings"" Trilogy in action, but it does have more creatures. As a movie critic for Prince Caspian, I give this 4 out of a possible 5 stars."
negative,"BEWARE if you have a widescreen TV!: What's the deal, slipping the fullscreen version of Stuart Little in with the widescreen version of Stuart Little 2 and mislabeling the package?! A 4:3 aspect ratio film should NOT be called a ""Deluxe Version"" when there is a 16:9 version available. I feel very deceived/taken by this, and am docking these otherwise cute movies 2 full stars for Studio Stupidity."
positive,Stargate fan: I have been a fan of Stargate from the beginning. This movie was excellent. I would highly recommend it.
positive,very new york: I got this watch for my girlfriend's son for his 9th birthday because they had just moved to new york. He loves the watch.
positive,"Best Swing CD in the Universe: This is the best swing CD in the universe. Really. I have almost a hundred: Cab Calloway, Duke, Basie, Casey McGill, Lavay Smith, Beckett, Indigo Swing, etc etc etc. This one smokes them all. Buy it!"
positive,"My Majella!: I must admit I read this novel only to get the background on my girlfriend Majel's name. I initially held no respect for its ""Great American Love Story"" subtitle, but this book really hit me right in the chest. I liked that I was able to extract the characters' personalities from their words and tones rather than from paragraphs of third-person description. I liked that it piqued my interest in nineteenth century Californian history, especially the upsetting struggle of the Mexicans and Native Americans living there. And lastly, I liked experiencing the boundless love that flowed from the simple, strong and beautiful Ramona. A quick, colorful, emotionally satisfying novel."
positive,"What I Thought Of ""Of Mice And Men"": ""Of Mice And Men"" is a terrific book! Especially at the end when Lennie gets shot. I just love the foreshadowing, for example, when Lennie kills the mouse, then the puppy, it leads you to beleive that he could maybe kill another thing, and then Curley's wife walks in. I also love the awkward pair,Lennie, the slow, large man, and George, the smarter, smaller guy. Altogether, I enjoyed reading this book and I will probably read it again! I give it four stars because I just couldn't put it down!"
negative,"Long winded.: This video was dull and did not provide any information that I didn't already read in the books that I checked out from the public library for free. I'm fairly disappointed with my purchase and I feel that my money could have been better spent. I find the video rather pricey, but gave it a try because of a very enthusiastic recommendation from a friend. Needless to say, if you are the type of person who must have audio and visual to learn, steer clear of this and find an instructional video that's more concise. If you can learn through just reading, I highly suggest you just check out some books for free and save yourself some money. If you like long winded stories and have too much free time on your hands, this might be the video for you."
positive,"Best appliance EVER!: The Conair Infiniti BC173 Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Wet Dry Straightening Hot Air Styler is the best hair appliance I've ever had. It works like a dream. It straightens the hair while drying. It's so nice not to have to blow dry & then straighten with a flat iron. It saves so much time & effort. I would recommend this appliance to anyone who wants to have straight, shiny hair."
positive,"Of Mice and Men: Of Mice and Men, one of the best novels I've read before. But, before you read it, you should have at least a slight background about what happened on the great depression. Also, The author conceptualize many characters inside this novel and as more you read as more the story gets exciting. I highly recommend to read Of Mice and Men."
positive,"Life, It's Trials Included: This book is great! I love it and would even say that it is my favorite book. It is a charming story about 4 sisters, Meg (Margaret), Jo (Josephine), Beth( Elisabeth), and Amy. The book includes the truth about real life. It's not perfect and the author, Louisa May Alcott, understands that and therefore includes some tribulations throughout the lives of these charming girls. The book is set around the 1800s and includes all the prides,joys, fashions and styles of this time. I recomend that you read it. I know I enjoyed the descriptive tale of Little Women."
positive,"Hobbit Cool: This is a great animated feature that I think very well portrays the story of ""The Hobbit"", and it's magical lands and people. Some of it, me thinks, was a little cheap at times, but I love it. (especially Bilbo's song, 'The Greatest Adventure')"
negative,"Myth making and outright falsehoods.: Mark's book simply fuels the fantasy world of conspiracy ""fans"". He routinely takes quotes out of context, ignores inconvenient facts and distorts information to promote his own program, that of hate for FDR. Compare this book with Gordon Prange's works. It's easy to tell which person did the work and gives a rational view of the events surrounding this sad day in US history. If you want to see where Wiley has distorted the original information, check out www.ibiblio.org/pha, where thousands of pages of text await the person who doesn't want to be lead by the nose."
positive,"Quilt Club Review: As a member of a small quilting group, I purchased six copies of Jenny's Country Kitchen: Recipes for Making Homemade a Little Easier by Jennifer Wood for group members. Every person in the group love the variety of recipes and the overall layout of the book and it's practical and easy to prepare recipes. Members have used several recipes and report the success in results and reception of food prepared. I, personally, will be purchasing additional copies for my daughters and daughter-in-law. Monique D. Graveline"
positive,"One of Bradbury's best: I rarely read SF, I'm more of a fan of general fiction books like Prince of Tides or The Triumph and the Glory. But I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for a class and actually enjoyed it. It had an aura of chilling prophecy, the world may well deteriorate to conditions like that described in Bradbury's classic book, where books are burned. I hope not, though, Amazon would lose even more money than they are now."
negative,"Pampers: I was really unhappy using these,they leaked badly many times.In the past I have used the Pampers Cruisers and was very happy with them.I now buy Huggies little movers since I feel those are the best diapers around."
positive,Clan of the Cave Bear: This book was delivered on time and in the condition advertised. I would purchase a used book again from this source.
positive,"My All Time Greatest Book On Consulting: This is the book that finally made it ""click"" for me.I have bought copies for those I have coached and mentored and have seen them start right and quickly realize success for themselves.A great book that should grace the bookshelf of any person just starting out.To make it work you should be ready to work and actually use the tools and strategies provided."
positive,Great movie!: We all truly enjoyed this movie! The picture quality was beautiful and I know I will watch it again! Awesome!
negative,"blagh: I was hoping to have a condensed, to-the-point, informative guide on giving birth. I had missed my window of opportunity to be in a class and decided I preferred to be able to watch a video from home anyway. I feel that a lot of time is wasted in this video with theatrics and cheesy humor. I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it only to realize she was still desperately trying for laughs 5 minutes in to one point.I am probably going to purchase another video simply for the fact that her style irks me!"
positive,"An amazing book!: If you are looking for a very practical look at how to live a life rich in many more ways than money, although money comes to people living life with a 'definite purpose' as noted in the book."
negative,"Philosophy 101: I really hate to rain on the parade, but feel moved to write a review as an ""average viewer."" That is, I saw the film during its theatrical release, when I was 19; and I was unaware of any controversy surrounding the film, as I lived far from any ""cultural center."" (I was in Arkansas, actually.) This was the Vietnam era. I was a war protester, cultural misfit, and acidhead. My reaction to the film was, and is, one of boredom. That's not to say that there aren't some good bits: McDowell's Alex is an engaging screen character. But to speak of ""social commentary"" or ""philosophy"" in this film is to reveal an ignorance of the perfectly common and ordinary statements of bygone literary figures introduced to my generation (and, hopefully, others) in high school at latest. The film looked cheaply made in 1972, and that look has only worsened with time. If you want pop philosophy with a (relatively) good look, try _Brazil_ instead."
negative,"I'm looking for a different router: I'm using a Mac and a PC with this product. From the start, I could not get it to set-up like the directions instructed. I had to bring it to my local Res-Net office on campus for them to set-up. The big complaint I have with this router is the connection with the computer needs to be reset nearly every day for me, sometimes three times a day (PC and Mac). Depending on how heavy my internet usage is."
negative,"T'is a pity: I hate to say it but this book stank. Not that Mr. King's writing style is bad, I just suppose I want REAL EARTHBOUND SUPERNATURAL TERROR! Mr. King, leave the psycho and alien storylines alone please! I found myself quickly ripping thru the pages looking for a scare. Unfortunately, I found none."
negative,"The worst I have ever used: This is an upgrade? This razor is terrible. I usually let my facial hair go for a few days and then shave. The system worked great with the Mach 3 but I decided to ...upgrade. Big mistake, this thing is like shaving with a dull saw. Back to the Mach 3 for me."
positive,"My first try at fantasy with ""The Hobbit"": I recently read the ""Hobbit"" so that I could then move onto ""The Lord of the Rings"" and then go see ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies.I have never read Fantasy books before so this was my first one, and I have to say that Fantasy takes some getting used to.While I enjoyed ""The Hobbit"", I did find some parts of it slow and uninteresting. I decided that Fantasy is probably not my favorite genre, however, the the book was still good and I would recommend it.""The Hobbit"" tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, along with Gandalf the wizard and a band of dwarves taking a journey to try and reclaim treasure taken from the dwarves ancestors by an evil dragon.For someone used to reading books grounded closer to reality, the plot of this book may sound kind of funny. But after you read about the experiances of this group of adventurers, you will have to agree it is quite a fun story."
positive,"score: this is an excellent album for anyone. its definitely a two part album, with the first half filled with the unique field holler/blues sampling, the second with slower and more emotional tracks. watch for porcelein, southside (good guitar solos), bodyrock, if things were perfect, and inside."
negative,kj: the box says Ingrid Bergman and J Cotten. Its a lie. They are theiving from us. The box says it is Ingrid Bergman. How cna yoyu sell it as such when it is not her movie.
positive,"An adventure classic: I read this as historical research but quickly fell in love with it as a work of literature. There's a lot of first-we-did-this and then-we-did-that, but when Whymper moves away from chronological reporting, he shows himself to be one hell of a good writer. His conquest of the Matterhorn and the tragedy that quickly followed give the book its emotional core. If you like adventure stories, I don't know how you don't love this."
positive,"A Watershed Work!: This is the definitive watershed work that brought Buddhism to the West and explains it in a manner that's very easy for Westerners to understand. It is a wonderful book that uses a question and answer structure like the Catholic Catechism to enlighten the reader on the Buddhist faith. It covers every aspect of Buddhism and there's much to learn from it whether you are a beginner or a master or from the East or the West. I strongly recommend this book. I got so much out of it. This book answers a lot of very important questions, including ones that I have had for some time. It's been a real blessing to me."
positive,Travis McGee is still great.: I am rereading John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee books in order and am having a wonderful time. I highly recommend them.
positive,"Good overview of structured finance field: I liked this book because it's useful for people with various levels of structured finance knowledge. The first few chapters explain the thought process behind the rating process and provide an introduction into the structured finance world of thinking. The second half goes into more depth about actual rating processes. The third part addresses asset specific issues (auto, airlines, etc...) While the last few chapters of the book review more advanced methods of analysis.For people with little or no knowledge of the structured finance field, the first half of the book will provide a good understanding of the subject, the 2nd half of the book will probably required more time and effort to fully appreciate its value."
negative,"Poor Choice: Why is this book on a best-sellers list? I had to literally force myself to finish it, and was gravely disappointed. The writing is poor, filled with metaphors that just don't work. The reviews on the back cover also claim that it is ""hilarious""? I'm sure they didn't actually read the book. So for anyone who wants a good autobiographical book, read Augusten Burroughs, Running With Scissors, Dry, and Magical Thinking; David Sedaris doesn't even compare to Burroughs."
negative,"below expectations!: I was disappointed with this film, having heard all the good reviews. The chase scene really isn't that spectacular. I could not believe it when I saw this garbage beat out A Clockwork Orange for best picture! For a better action flick, check out Dirty Harry; It has a much better chase scene which involves Clint Eastwood riding on the roof of a school bus."
negative,"Oh please... is it something in the water?: The title shoud be changed to ""I'm now a Christian and here's why...."" I won't even bother to discuss the silly analogies and ridiculous attempts at logic to be found in this ""masterpeice"" of his. This book is great to Christians merely because it is a written example of one who has ""chosen the light"" and had a PhD, hooray! Also, the mere idea that there's still a war between science and religion in 2001 should baffle everyone and those responsible should find better, more constructive things to do with their life. If you are seeking the Truth, look to those whom you trust and ask them. Or look inside yourself for the answers, most are already there. Good luck to everyone and may God have mercy on your souls."
positive,Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie: Yet another timeless collection of great cartoons from the master himself - Mel Blanc. Although I would have like to have seen more of Daffy Duck.
positive,Excelent: Is excellent. I recommend it with your eyes closed. The trouble was that my edition came ugly and battered.
positive,"Awesome: An absolute must-read for ALL parents of both boys AND girls. Being a feminist, I had to keep reminding myself that when we take care of our boys we also take care of our girls. It has transformed the ways I look at my son and also my husband and other men in my life.Along with Reviving Ophelia it should be mandatory reading for all parents!(...)"
negative,"small didn't work: It is very small compared to what i thought it would be, but even so it didn't work when we got it"
negative,Somewhat Helpful: OK but not great. The female voice is not very soothing. I recommend Susie Mantell's Your Present; I believe it is far more effective.
negative,"Don't buy it!: I bought the platinum B70 and it immediately stopped working correctly. The thing repeatedly turned off for no reason whatsoever and if I had the patience to wait for it to work and the machine decided to randomly cooperate it would probably take 15 minutes to make a single cup of coffee. I would start it, it would make some noise like it was working and then shut off. Restart it...shut off. Restart it...shut off. Unplug it and start over and sometimes it would work. So I sent it back for an exchange and the new one I received did the same thing so I sent it back again but this time I asked for a refund. It turns out you get only an 80% refund even though it is faulty and doesn't work right and even though I sent it within 30 days. So I am out $31.00. Then I bought a standard model at Costco. It shuts off by itself too. So I'm 0 for 3 and I'm very surprised this hasn't happened to a lot more people. I doubt if 0 for 3 is just bad luck! Don't buy it!"
positive,"Paul Hogan great as always: Miss these kind of movies, remember getting so excited as a kid to find out the Crocodile Dundee movies were coming on that weekend, couldn't wait to watch them."
positive,Fantastic!: This story is epic. Asimov shines in The Foundation. Makes you want to read the whole series. (something Im in the process of doing now. ;)
positive,"Much Better than the first: This follow up to Into the Wilderness was very enjoyable. I was not too thrilled with the first book, but thought I would read the next book anyway. I was pleasantly suprised and got a better feel for the characters. I will buy the next one with interest!"
negative,"Oh, how I hate these diapers!!!: When I had my son 8 years ago, I swore by Pampers. They were the only brand I used. I recently tried them for my one year old daughter after using another brand and in just one week I cannot believe the amount of leaks we have had!! She is constantly soaking right through them. They sag in the back with only a small amount of liquid in them. My husband is begging me to go back to our old brand, which I am promptly going to do. I don't know if these diapers work better on boys than on girls or if they have just changed them. I HATE them! Terrible."
positive,"fast shipping and great comunication: the seller was always prompt to reply to all my requests, I'd definetely buy from them again!"
negative,"One long WTF? moment.: We watched Last Tango in Paris mainly just to say we've seen it. Little did we realize how messed up most of the characters are & how disturbing a few scenes would be...however, it is french directed so I guess that explains it (a genre neither my wife or I have ever been able to embrace). Did not care for the film at all but give it 2 stars for the shockingly hairy full frontal."
negative,To be honest....: To be 100% honest i thought the movie was boring and too sappy for a cartoon.The old guy got on my nerves and the movie was just so unlike adam.I mean come on we all know he could have done way better than this stupid movie.Im sorry but i just think the movie was horrible.
negative,Horrible...: Oh my God!It's unbelievable how this movie could gain so much popularity.I think Luc Besson did not know anything about Joan of Arc.And Milla Jovovich shouldn't play this role.She couldn't expressed her (I mean Joan's of Arc) emotions.She was crying and shouting all the time.Nothing more.Besides she was too old to play 17 years old girl.Only one thing in this movie was impressive - batallistc scenes. I am very disappointed with this movie.I guess most of the people who know Joan's biography after watching this movie would feel the same as I do.
negative,"Big fan of the book, but give me a break British Hollywood: Harry Potter is getting too old, and I even think he is gaining weight (right along with the rest of the cast). I am not sure that I can handle 2 hours of the British accent, and the whole thing is totally predictable if you read the book, they hardly make any changes...nice try guys. But a big ZERO for me!One last thought for those considering whether to watch this movie, (and I am not trying to be critical here, just honest...every movie deserves at least three stars because someone worked very hard to get it on the big screen and then on DVD, and besides I don't think we should be judging everyone.) don't you think we have seen enough Harry Potter for awhile? Its getting stupid."
positive,"Very satisfied!: It came on time, and it was in the condition that they indicated it would be. I am very satisfied!"
negative,"Slow moving predictable story: The story is a very simple one but the action, so to speak, doesn't really happen until the final third of the book. It was a battle to get through the dry middle!Unfortunately the story is also exceptionally easy to guessand the turns of the story are not surprising in the least.On the plus side, the book gives a good glimpse at life in Puritan early American communities and their moral strucutres."
negative,"Worked like a charm! FOR 5 MINUTES: Really wanted this to work, but sadly disappointed. Literally worked for about 5 minutes and then stopped heating altogether. How difficult can it be to make such a device that actually works?"
positive,"A wonderful classic...: I was assigned this book to read in 10th grade ""American Literature"" class. Suprisingly this book was enjoyable to read and had a few events that caught me off guard. I loved this book and would recommend this to anyone of any age."
negative,"Don't waste your time or money: This is an absolutely horrible movie. My kids love spiderman and walked away from the theatre saying ""it was bad"", just as I did.The whole theatre was obviously disappointed with all the yawns and talking about everything but the movie during the movie. I seen kids wiggling/watching their fingers and being more entertained than watching the movie!"
negative,"Product didn't match the picture/description: Unless they sent me the wrong product by mistake, the foot cushion picture and description does not match the item delivered. I was under the impression I would receive two (a pair) of water filled foot cushions that I could insert into my shoes. Instead I received ONE foot cushion, filled with another material (not water) that you attach to your foot via a toe strap. I was definately not happy with the item and sent it back for a refund. Luckily for me Amazon has a great return policy... they make returns very easy!"
negative,"Great book, but not this Kindle edition: There's no question on the importance of Hodge's book. But this $3 Kindle edition is simply scanned with OCR and is almost worthless. It would have been far easier to read it in simple image form."
negative,DuD: This was a nice looking timer but right out of the box was a DUD.Would not work at all at first.Then it started working after bending the a/c prongs a bit.Ran about 6 hr. with pump and it got hot and quit.Will trash this as its not worth going through the return crap.
positive,"Great album!: Whatever happened to them? I wish they made more music, I know I would have bought more. Maybe they will do a comeback tour one day?"
positive,Trials of True Friendship: This book is very applicable to everyday life. It is a great resource to use in the classroom. It is also a great book to just check out of the library and read (ideal for young female adults). It is a classic novel that will never be forgotten.
negative,Not appropriate for 9 yr olds: My very athletic 9 yr old absolutely could not use this - much too hard - returned it.
positive,"Coyote Aint So Ugly: Thsi movie delivers with a little of everything, action, romance, and a little something extra for the guys. Violet, a little town girl, has roamed into the big city in search of her dream. To be a professional songwriter. The only way to make the money she needs to support herself she has to get from dancing on a bear at a local pub, or so it seems. You should see this movie if your looking for a love story, a little fun for the guys, or a laugh out loud riot, in all i give this flick 4 stars for greatness."
positive,Pictures!: I bought this for a friend for her birthday and it didn't have a picture posted but from the description I figured it was the old version without the scary lady on the cover but it wasn't. Oh well.
positive,"Pleasantly Surprised...: I was a huge fan of Mr Aiken's during American Idol but the over produced single had me doubting whether or not I would enjoy the full length CD. I am pleasantly surprised because Clay sounds like...Clay. But he also sounds like a genuine pop star and puts his magnificant voice to good work here. The Way is sensual and beautiful. Perfect Day is uplifting, and Measure of a Man sums up Clay to a tee. A great freshman effort here and I cant wait for the next."
negative,"Worst History Book Of All: This has got to be the worst and boring history book of all. Throughout my entire years in school reading history book this has to be the worst. It gets so boring you can't even read it if you try. If you did read it, chances are you did not understand them 10 pages. Combining with a horrible professor and book it's going to be one long semester for me."
positive,"Surprisingly good, and interesting for non-believers too: I am a huge fan of Sergio Castellitto, and as a frequent visitor to Southern Italy I wanted to learn more about the life of Padre Pio. Although I am an atheist, I enjoyed this film very much, in much the same way that I enjoy visiting churches in Italy. A surprisingly good, interesting film, that grabbed my interest until it ended nearly four hours later! I recommend this movie to anyone interested in Southern Italian culture."
positive,"A wonderful holiday film!...: I just received the DVD of ""The Greatest Store In The World"" and enjoyed it very much! I had heard of this film before but could never find a copy of it until now, and it was certainly worth waiting for! As always, the British really know how to make a great film! This charming holiday movie was made for TV in England back in 1999. All the players here give wonderful performances, especially Elizabeth Earl (who also gave a great performance in ""Fairy Tale-A True Story"" in 1997, one of my favorite films of all time), her younger sister, Holly Earl and Dervla Kerwan as their mother. The supporting cast also gave first rate performances and I highly reccomend this movie to anyone who loves great, heartwarming holiday films. This is one of the best I've ever seen!"
negative,"Stick with Tae Bo: This was the WORST tape I've ever gotten! The Tae Bo Live Series and original Advanced tape are far better workouts and more comprehensive than this. I agree that the double-time is way too fast and you simply don't get a workout from this.Tracy is terrible. She is annoying, her moves are basic and boring (think beginner's jazz class with box steps and grapevines). I do not recommend this to anyone looking for a good workout.Stick with TAE BO!!"
positive,"Great action film !: With the sequel realeased at thre moment, this is a must be watched movie. If you like action movies with great effects and storline you will love this movie, Tom Cruise fits the role like a glove, if you like James Bond, secret agent movies as I do then I would say this is one of the best non-bond movies around. The story line invloves Tom Cruise as typical secret agent on a mission, suddenly the mission goes wrong and all his team get wiped out, Tom is accused of sabotaging the mission and needs to find out what really happend. This is an ideal opening to a superb mystery action film. If the sequel comes close to its predecessor then your in for another thrill ride. The DVD is superb, both formats and awsome dolby 5.1 sound, if you have seen the movie on video, buy the DVD to experience it as it was meant to watched."
negative,"Not her best...: To be perfectly honest, I didn't like Amarantine very much, only a little, whereas I love her other albums. This is definitely not her best, and five years is too long to wait for a rather disappointing album. The songs are reminiscent (I do no want to use the word ""rehashed"") of her older -and better- ones. One example is ""Someone Said Goodbye"" which is very similar in theme and rythm to ""One by One"" in ""A Day Without Rain"". Buy it only if you're a die-hard Enya fan, but if you're new to her music, try her master-pieces, Watermark, The Memory of Trees, and The Celts."
negative,Not so great.: DISAPPOINTING!!! This album was a complete let down. It is watered down. As bland as a piece of toast with no butter. Plain rock. Nothing Ducky Boys about it. I hate this album. I really do. I hope that they realize this and never attempt this type of sound again.
positive,"I LOVE THIS BEAR SO MUCH!: Out off all the teddy bears I have bought, this one remains one of my favorites. It is very encouraging and unbelievably adorable! The legs are actually folded behind as if the bear was praying. If you want a minni prayer partner order this bear!"
negative,"This is a disgrace to DVDs: There could have been so many extras here, and we get nothing. When the movie aired on network television, it put in entire sequences that made the cutting room floor, including the weasels painting a pig head on Eddie. Not only do they not give us the cut scenes, but I would have also liked to see some ""making of"" features or maybe some commentary. Anything! This movie deserves better."
negative,"DO NOT BUY!!!!: Not only did it just last a month, but Amazon gave me a hard timeabout returning it since it worked when I first receieved it.In all the years that I have ordered from Amazon, and thousands ofdollars that I have spent there, I have been fortunate to nothave to return anything. After this experience, I now know betterthan to ever order electronics from them. It's much better tobuy from a store that will take it back if it stops working aftermerely a month. The agents at the third world country that Amazonhas outsourced customer service to obviously thought that 46 dollarsfor an electric pencil sharpener that worked for a month was notunacceptable. After years of enjoying the convenience of orderingfrom Amazon, I will think twice about ordering ANYTHING from them again."
negative,This book stunk: this was the biggest waste of ime on earth i cant believe i actually read the whole thing. Complete garbage.
positive,"Really Fun Read: WOW! Judi McCoy has done it again. All her books are fun, funny and endearing, but this last one, Heaven in Your Eyes, is one of the best. I thoroughly enjoyed the personality of her heroine, Anne and her hero, Drew is a hottie! The story is fast-paced and engaging and the end, a surprise. It's definately worth the price of the book - I'll read it again."
negative,"Received wrong product: I ordered Constantine and got another DVD instead. I shipped back Constantine at shippers request. Haven't received Constantine yet. Please credit my credit card as it's been to long. I no longer want the DVD.Thanks, Al Pins"
positive,"Who Died?: Mrs. Twain murdered herself. You mean she committed suicide. No, it was murder...she really hated herself. There are so many lines you can quote that it is impossible to not love this movie. All the classic actors are in this. Back in the day Professor McGonagall was a head turner. This is a must watch for anyone who has a pulse...eyes are not required."
negative,"Weird: I dont even know what to say about this flim, all I can say is that it's very dumb and it really pissed be off cuz IM a huge Kurt Cobain fan......But it is kind of funny but yet so depressing... But yah if your the type of person who likes to watch movies that has no talking hardly n' luv watchin people just walk around then Hey you should really like this flim"
positive,"Southern Country Tradition Continues in this Great Album!: A new entry to the Outlaw Country genre. Although that statement isn't completely accurate since some of the songs on this album show a softer side to Davidson than his outlaw side.When I first heard this album, my immediate thought was that we now have someone to carry on the rock, outlaw, blues country. The sound is a familiar southern country sound that Travis Tritt, Hank, Jr. and Waylon Jennings perfected years ago.Davidson showcases a strong voice while adding lyrics that aren't forced. His voice is haunting as you remember some of the best of genre and wonder if they aren't coming through Davidson. It is wonderful to see the industry signing artists such as Davidson.... it proves that the industry isn't abandoning the strong southern country sound in favor for the new country-pop crossover acts that are all too frequent. If you are looking for an updated ""Good Ole Boy"" album, this one is it!"
positive,the ending blew it: the ending [was not good]. i wont tell what happens. it will just ruin a already horrid ending. the acting was good and funny. it was excellent.
negative,"AWFUL: These have to be the worst diapers I have ever bought! Waste of money, useless at night, they leak and smell after being worn for just a short period of time. Seventh Generation are by far the best I've used and will continue to do so, don't know what I was thinking buy these"
positive,"Clever verse book for children: Although a fun book to read to a child, not Lynley Dodd's best. The various cats' names are quite clever, and the last page is entertaining for a child who likes surprises. I was hoping for more extended rhymes and a more complex story (a la Slinky Malinki), but this one is not quite of the same calibre. Still, a good addition to a child's library."
positive,A good Anime Soundtrack: I got this one by accident but hey I didn't send it back and I listen to it all the time and I hadn't even seen the movie! Now that I have seen the movie and own it I would say this is a must have.
positive,"subtle masterpiece: There is more to this book than meets the eye, you may lay to that. Apart from the fairy tale plot there is superb dialogue and dialect hidden in the pages. The relationship between Long John and Jim unfolds grippingly. There are also superbly detailed scenes of action and adventure allways achieved with an economy of language. The seafaring language is used very deliberately without any ostentation. Always a pleasure to read. Great pace."
negative,"Uncertain: Michael Levy's books have helpful information, however, after a while I got frustrated with all his poetry. To me, it distracted from the point of what I was reading."
negative,"I've read one third of the book, and then dumped it.: I liked the idea of the book's basis; that is, blogging about learning French cooking by using Julia Child's book about French cooking. But I couldn't stand the author's personality style as it came through in her writing. It's not so much that she uses the F-word a great deal, but the fact that she is a whiney, crybaby, mean-spirited person. I feel sorry for her husband for having to put up with her histrionics. My copy is the paperback of 300 pages, and after having read the first 100 pages I cannot take any more of her. I've never felt this way about a book before, but it makes me angry. Sorry."
positive,Interesting and thought provoking book on development!: This book has given me some insights on how to solve problems either individually or as a team member. I'm not quite ready to accept all of the ideas but it does give me something to think about! I really liked the fact that it contains both theory and practical advice for both developers and managers!
negative,"Will wake up the family with NOISE!: I had an older Keurig machine which was bigger but great. I purchased this Model which looks more like something out of sharper Image. the water container has an internal blue LED light that illuminates the water a Star Trek like blue and will flash when the water gets low. So if you like a nice big cup of Joe or tea you'll need to fill it often. Now that said, about the noise factor - this thing sucks in water and growls very loudly, like a coffee grinder. If you are filling a big mug of coffee, you will need to fill your cup twice which means the machine will have to suck water in 4 TIMES which lasts about 6 or 7 seconds. It rattles anything on the kitchen counter from the vibration frequency. Sounds great doesn't it...."
negative,"Pointless Book Lulls Students to Sleep!: Unfortunatly I was required to read this atrocious book for school. I am a very forgiving student when it come to books that are dull, but this one drove me past my limit. The examples are outdated and pointless. There are too many references to dreag racing and silverware.Granted she might have some good points but you can't see them because they are buried so deeply in her ramblings. It was THE MOST BORING BOOK I have ever read!! It was difficult staying awake.This torture may have been worthwhile if there was something to be learned. Unfortunately there is nothing to be learned!!!You could condense the book down to ONE sentence- Writing is important, like drag racing, and never say the word there. Okay thats the book.I just saved you 7 bucks and the pain of deciphering the boring words in MICROSCOPIC PRINT. Ilearned as much froim her book as I do from SWEDISH PROPAGANDA that i do not understand.Only Swedish propaganda wasd more interseting!!"
positive,Excellent summary of little known area of WWII: Ms. Wiggins has covered the human aspects of this part of World War II submarine operations with a fresh and interesting perspective. Her inclusion of personal interview material make the story more credible. A good read for any history buff.Cdr. John A. Holt USN(Ret)
negative,0 STARS FOR THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE! THEY NEED TO BAN THIS MOVIE FROM THE STORE SHELVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!! yOU WILl WaNT YoUR MONeY BACk AnD yOUR TIMe. Please take my advice I stopped watching after the 78 minute mark and I skipped to the end. It does not make any sense like other reviewers have said and its basically like watching the same movie over and over and over. Good thing I didn't pay any money on this vulgar trash its not worth 2 cents of anyone's hard earned cash. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
positive,The hobbit: The hobbits was a very good book had good action stayed moving the whole time and was never boring .
positive,Exciting read: Wanted to read the book before the movie was released....I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very funny at times. Looking forward to seeing it on the big screen!
positive,"go!: this is a great english debut and the included russian songs are even more fantastic. definitely check out, i predict they'll be huge within a few months!"
negative,3/4 of it is missing!: This video description says 4 episodes of Morocco and Russia but it only shows 1 episode of Morocco! 1 episode of Morocco is missing and there is nothing at all on Russia! :(
positive,"Love this: This is very nice, well made, real warm. Love the color, can fit into many decors. Awesome quality."
positive,"Great voice, Great album: I was prepared to love this CD before it came out because I love to listen to Clay sing anything. It's one of the few CD's/albums I've ever heard that I don't want to skip any songs, and have several favorites that I think would also play well on the radio, if given the chance. I've heard other reviews of ""too sappy"", ""vanilla"", etc., but I don't see that. Just good songs (don't all songs have cliches?) catchy tunes, and of course, Clay's powerhouse voice, which always makes me smile. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is not Clay's fault. It's because on a couple songs, such as ""Run to Me"", the background music tends to drown out Clay's voice, and THAT'S what I want to hear. Other than that, I would tell everyone to buy this album and I would gush about it, and Clay as I always do when I get the chance."
negative,"So much potential, so little entertainment: Well, I just watched both of these movies, back to back. And I have to say I was really disappointed in both. There was so much potential for them both to be exciting as well as informative and musically captivating, but both fell short. Way short. The first was nothing but a bunch of kids riding up and down the streets all night long, obviously out of boredom, and only creating more boredom, to good music that was always too far in the background. The second movie followed them as they progressed into the 60s era, and this time in three or four separate and completely chopped up scenarios, and again with good 60s music that was not pronounced enough to bring back many memories to the viewer.I'm actually sorry I didn't just watch them on cable and forget them. Neither are movies I would want to watch again - unless I was having trouble sleeping."
negative,"TV scripts don't always make good books: There are some touching chapters in this book, but overall, some of the material was less-than-gripping. As I read this book, I could imagine the text as part of a TV news story script complete with old pictures, natural sound, some long pauses in the piece as the camera pushes in or pulls out on the shot. Coupled with the video, these chapters would be powerful. Without the video, they read a bit on the dull side. I can't argue with these people being called the greatest generation but I would argue with those that claim this book as the greatest tribute to the greatest generation"
positive,Must read book for beginner: One of the best book I Have read on witchcraft. Easy understanding. Someone who is just starting out this is one of the book I would recommend.
positive,"Best Batman movie ever.: When Batman Begins was announced, I (like so many others) found myself saying ""oh no, not ANOTHER one!!!"" In fact, I didn't go see this one in the theater until it was almost released to DVD...one night on a boring business trip when I had nothing better to do, I strolled to the local theater and decided to check it out......and WOW.If you were tired of the Batman flicks of the '90's and how they got worse with each movie, do not fear. This one is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest (yes, even better than the first one with Jack Nicholson). Batman Begins is, in a word, incredible.Strong performances from Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, and others. A fabulous storyline that is much, much more than cheesy one-liners and ridiculous comic book style visuals and effects. And some great action sequences that will even make you say ""WOW"" in this era of super-sized special effects.A review can't do it justice...SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!"
positive,"Great Book with Typical Flaw: Until Bishop Wright finishes Volume 4 of his magnum opus, Christian Origins and the Question of God, we will have to do with his shorter monographs on Paul's thought. As always, the trenchant scholarship and sharp writing shines through.And, as always it seems, the same flaw appears whenever Wright tries to be relevant to the contemporary church: his ideas of Christian social justice are just the most shopwarn cliches of the most warmed over academic leftism imaginable. For example, he decries widespread consumer debt as creating ""misery for millions"" and profits for a ""tiny minority."" As if borrowers don't borrow because it is in their interest to do so, and as if lenders would lend without being paid a return for their trouble. To hold opinions like this means being totally ignorant of modern economics. It is one thing to take every thought captive for Christ - another to indulge foolishness. Remember Mark 7 - folly is sin."
positive,"If you're a hardcore Transformers fan: you've GOTTA get it!: as a kid, when the movie came out in theaters I was going out of my Transformers phase so I never bothered to see it...until now.you have to approach this movie with an open mind, its great! I admit the soundtrack is kinda cheezy (it was the 80's afterall) but the action packed conflicts between the Autobots and Desepticons make up for it. tons of action, new worlds, new characters...this movie will have you searching for all your old Transformer toys. true fans - you can't go wrong!"
negative,Long drawn out...all over the place!!!!: I saw this movie at the UMFF. It was toooo long. It was into 67 mins and still haven't got to the point. The storylines ...well so are all over the place. I would recommend putting on this movie if you have insomia. Trust me it will put you to sleep
negative,"Far from perfect...: I had high hopes for these to make my new Jawbone Era usable.Unfortunately, they are hard to fit, are not as flexible or form fitting as I had hoped and overall could stand to be much improved.Buy them if you have no other choice, but don't expect much or you'll be disappointed."
positive,"I'm happy with mine.: I've had no problems with it yet after about 7-8 months. It's pretty fast once it starts printing. It takes a few moments to start a print job though. I'm using the USB connection so it could be my USB controller that's slow, I don't know. I'd buy another HP printer in the future. I just hope HP can make the installation process simpler.Color prints on glossy are not bad but don't expect them to look exactly like real photographs. Either I bought the wrong model for ""film camera quality"" pictures or ink printers just aren't up to par yet. ..."
positive,A classic: This movie is a classic. I admin this movie is not just for everyone. That makes it even more valuable to me. If you don't understand it then at least try not to show it and better don't watch it.
negative,"The word in brackets says it all.: [ABRIDGED]?? You can't abridge Tolkien, any more than you can abridge Dickens. And who in their right mind would want an abridged edition anyway? It's not as if _The Hobbit_ was a very long book. Even with _The Lord of the Rings_, which is far longer, all the people I know that liked it say it's not long enough."
positive,Good Value for what you get: The caliper come with a case an extra battery and instruction. It give pretty accurate readings and the build quality is pretty good for the price. The batteries that came with mine including the replacement seem to die out faster than I expected. The replacement I bought from cvs appears to last longer. August will be 3 years since I purchase this from amazon and it is still working today.
negative,"Too fantastical: Interesting premise but carried to such fantastical extreme as to disabuse. The story deteriorates from a somewhat intriguing tale to imaginary nonsense. Director Cohen does say in his commentary that since nobody really knows what goes on in those ""secret"" societies at Yale, Harvard, etc. (and as a Harvard alum I have to add, nobody cares), Cohen and his colleagues could let their imaginations run free. Well, they did. Yale, meet the Addams Family and The Munsters. Morticia and Lurch are more believable than the Skullsters in this thing. Nicely photographed movie though, especially the ersatz Ivy League interiors, somewhat reminiscent of older edifices at the real Harvard. Kudos for cinematography. Thumbs down on plot. Thumbs up for Craig T. Nelson as Mandrake, Sr., a cad you come to relish hating."
positive,"Francie Nolan is my favorite heroine: I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith as a teenager many years ago. I went on to read her other novels as well. I got the audiobook for my husband and I to listen to on a trip. I still love it. I think I missed some of the underlying messages when I read it when I was young, and I don't think I really agree with Ms. Smith's world view, her political and theological ideology. But I love her rather poetic writing style, and the way the characters are so REAL! The reader on this audio version is excellent as well. Everyone should read this book!"
negative,"Give me the original: I was surprised and delighted to see this ""remake"". After purchasing I was, well, disappointed. I guess because the framework of the story was the same but nothing else was. The modernisation of the action was poor, the story only Ok and I didn't find it engaging except in one scene. A satisfying ending with all the story nicely wrapped up but I think the cast deserved a better story line and sticking to the original concept and doing a real remake with modern cinema techniques could have made this a four star candidate. Oh well I guess we'll never see a good modern updated version because this certainly is not it!"
negative,"Confusing and Contradictory: Okay, I have read, analyzed, and written an 11- page paper on this book, and I don't have good things to say about it. The critics say it is a brilliant insight on the personality of the absurd, and they believe that Camus is amazing. Please. Camus could not decide what kind of character he wanted Meusault to be. One minute M. didn't care about anything, while the next he was absorbed in Marie's smile. I did not find the book insightful at all, and I honestly feel it is a waste of time to try to find deep meaning in it."
negative,Just buy from amazon not an indie seller: I ordered it new and it came in in an already opened case and it was fairly poor condition I had to tape it for it to stay together....enough said
positive,Swagman Bike Rack: Very well made and solid (heavy). Not the sort of rack you would want to pull on and of your vehicle by yourself very often. If you want a rack where you don't worry about your bikes swinging in the breeze this is it. The rack does fold up so it doesn't stick out the back too badly when the bikes aren't on. The receiver pin tightens to take out the slop between the hitch and the rack.
negative,"Sent the wrong merchandise: I was greatly disappointed with Amazon, upon receipt of this product !! I clearly specified that I wanted the COLORISED version and clicked on same. I was led to believe by AMAZON that the colorised version was available, so I ordered it...And when it arrived, it was the same old B&W; version !! I'm still interested, but ONLY if it's colorised...Please let me know CLEARLY if you have that version available or not. I can always give away the B&W; version if I can acquire the colorised version....Do you have it or not???? Please answer me at [...] And no double talk, please !!Annie Silva"
negative,"These are NOT the ORIGINAL ARTISTS!!!!: Don't make the same mistake I did!!! First of all, there are only 6 discs, NOT the 7 discslisted! And, if you are interested in quality - meaning you'd like to hear these songs sung by the actual people who made them famous - then DON'T buy this product!!!"
positive,Power to women: I read this book when I was 16 and I totally fell in love with it. I love the power it hands over to women. Hawthorne does a great job in illustrating the kind of prejudice society extends to women for actions that can be equally distributed to men but even more so he shows the determination of a woman to overcome whatever adversities may be present with renewed pride and dignity.
negative,not her best: this book is not one of her bests. i found it boring and that i was struggling through it. when i read the intro it sounded good but then when i started reading i just didn't like it at all. i mean it was basically an on going battle between Trevor trying to make her love him and her protesting because she loved Richard. it was just sooo boring!
positive,"Loved it!!: This movie was different, as in it's more dug into the past of Bruce Wayne. Which I loved, since Batman was becoming very one dimensional in the other movies. Emotion is the key to this film. We learn how Bruce becomes Batman, and HOW he earned his MIRACULOUS combat training! Christian Bale is extremely beautiful, and very sincere as Bruce Wayne. It doen't hurt that his chiseled body looks good if, it was drenched in wipped cream and cherries.This is the best Batman movie I have ever saw!"
positive,good stuff: Great read. It gives someone who thinks the game is just about throwing and hitting a different view on how the game is really played
positive,"Hilarious!: I believe this movie started off as a 2 minute cartoon skit on Saturday Night Live, but that can't compare to the laughs that this movie will bring you. You'll want to get this movie, believe me... But instead of getting this movie, you may want to consider getting the limited edition collecters disc as it's loaded with extras!!"
negative,"Great book, poor translation: The Master and Margarita is indeed one of the best written books ever. Unfortunately Glenny's translation leaves much to be desired. It reflects none of Bulgakov's witty, quirky, beautifully flowing style, and reads more like a verbatim translation of a theological treatise."
positive,"Great movie especially for those who are fans of the games: I haven't seen this on home video, but on TV recently, which I thought was great, except that there wasn't so much based on the game. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo are Mario and Luigi, which is OK. There is a Princess named Daisy, not Toadstool. King Koopa is human, not a reptile. Also, there were no fire flowers nor were there any invincibility stars. If you like the games, you will love this movie. I hope to see it on DVD."
positive,Great book: I've been reading this to my boys and we are loving it. We can't wait to see the movie. Now they have Legos too.
negative,"Unintentionally Hilarious: I first saw this in the mid-80's, and even as a pre-teen just laughed myself silly at this ludicrous departure from the ""Halloween"" tradition. Michael Myers, whose relentless earnestness made the first two films horror classics, is conspicuously absent, instead replaced by a ridiculous premise about children being converted into monsters by wearing ""Silver Shamrock"" Halloween masks. The final twenty minutes or so of the film inundate the viewer with a thoroughly annoying, synthesized jingle for the Silver Shamrock company that is memorable because it is some of the most pathetically cheesy music ever to be captured on celluloid. The only things that are scary about this movie are that John Carpenter put his name on it and a movie company actually mass marketed it. Otherwise, everything about the film, from the acting to the special effects, is downright laughable. File this one under ""unintentional comedy."""
positive,"Fun story from the free ebook list: I have this as a paperback but didn't want to dig it out of storage before seeing John Carter of Mars. I wanted to refresh my memory of this fun story. It is a dry narration of John Carter's experience. As I was thinking, the movie butchered the story. I originally read this story in junior high along with the entire series. This is a storystory best read and not seen at the theaters. I've also read the Gor series which has a similar storyline."
positive,The Hobbit: This book was boasting with the great imagination of J.R.R Tolkein. About 60 years before the lord of the seires Bilbo Gandlaf and a gang of Dwarfs travel through the misty moantians to get to a treasure stolen from the Dwarfs. As the gang travels through the land they meet tons of epic characters (elfs dwarfs goblins trolls). Tolkein could have written more voilence like its sequel Lord of the Rings. Overall it was a epic classic.
negative,"Romeo And Juliet: I think this movie follows the play very well, but scene 13 is horrible. There is full nudity which is not necessary. I have seen movies and plays and am shocked that a G rated movie would show not only Romeo's rear but Juliet's breasts. I would never recommend this version for students of any age."
positive,"ALMOST EVERYTHING: THIS BOOK HAS ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU COULD EVER NEED AND EVEN SOME STUFF YOU MIGHT NOT! I LOVE HOW IT'S RING-BOUND, BUT THE ONE PROBLEM I'VE FOUND IS THAT THERE IS ONLY 1 POCKET AT THE VERY BACK. IF YOU BUY SEPERATE TABS WITH FOLDERS FOR EACH SECTION, YOU'LL BE ALL SET!"
negative,"Amusement park entertainment in a theatre! Oh,joy....: Special effects extravaganza, without a doubt. Very beautiful people, (especially Oded Fehr who adroitly delivers the only bearable character). Otherwise, populated by shallow and stereotypic personages. Script hangs by a thread with tongue-in-cheek humor. Oded Fehr admonishes while Brandon Frasier smirks, Rachel Weiss bubbles, John Hannah whines, and Arnold Vosloo up-chucks. Just what you'd expect on a roller-coaster ride."
positive,"Great book: This book was great, and an overall thriller! I loved it, and so will fantasy fans. Overall one of the best books ever"
negative,"Cannary [row] ( Cannary row): Cannery row wasn't in my words the most exciting book I have ever read(throwing slabs of meat against a wall would of been more amusing), but it wasn't the worst book I have ever been forced to absorb(The giver). If you're an adventure seeking reader(like me)this book is probally not for you....especialy if you're forced to read it for english class! Perhaps if the writter had worded the book a little differently it would of been better...*stops and thinks*(possibly...not...)*sweet drop*. Now that I'm done slammin on the book I might as well not scare you off to bad(you poor souls who have to suffer as I have)! There is one interesting part in the book, its the part where Mack and da boys get drunk and trash Doc's place! thats all I'm telling you! Your gonna have to tape your eyelids open and read it yourself!!!*laughs maliciously*"
negative,"The never ending story: All English teachers will agree that detail within a story is a must. They will also agree that there is a point where the detail is no longer helpful but, instead, becomes a nuisance. Jean M. Auel's detail of Ayla's surroundings quickly surpassed the category of descriptive writing and entered the ranks of A Bushman's Guide To Nature. I am Only a high school student but it doesn't take a professional to recognize a disaster. The story is slow and filled with useless detail. All in all I feel that Jean M. Auel should abandon any interests she may have in continuing with the series."
positive,"Yes we Cannery: Man I love Steinbeck, love him!This book was not a disappointment. It wasn't as much of a novel as a group of short stories with a thin novel thread running through it. It's like the Canterbury Tales on steroids.The characters are all so interesting, almost each one has a chapter or two devoted to them. You could probably read the stories in any order, they're arranged chronologically but you could probably put them in a deck and shuffle them and come out with something unique and powerful.This book is written about the period right after the depression but right before WWII, this time period was still considered to be in the depression but the economy was past the low point. Things weren't as bad as they were but they certainly hadn't picked up.So I say yes yes yes read this book. it's a rewarding experience."
negative,DO NOT BUY THIS COPY!!!: This copy is only a low-quality PHOTOCOPY book of the original one. DO NOT BUY THIS. It is not worth your money.I am very disappointed to find out Amazon allows this item on shelf.
positive,"This vs. Huggies Snug & Dry: I liked that these were a lot softer than the Huggies Snug & Dry. The Huggies feel stiff and too much like paper.Absorbency wise, I tried both of these overnight and the Huggies had better absorbency.Overall, I like these diapers. They are soft and absorbency is pretty good. I'll keep using these since Amazon has a great offer. Can't beat this price."
positive,"Oh the memories.: I grew up with the first generation of this book. It is the cookie bible. I remember reading through this as a children ooohhhing and ahhhing at all the beautiful pictures of the cookies. When ordering a new cook book on amazon this popped up in related searches and as soon as I saw it, I had to have it. It is the same exact book that has been printed for over 50 years now and it is such a treasure. I am the third generation to have this book now and I will be buying my children when they have family's of their own. I am so excited for my children to ohhh and ahhh at the cookies and help mommy make beautiful batches of Christmas cookies soon."
positive,Gladiator (Extended Edition) is Great: Truly a masterpiece. This DVD belongs in every collection. The extended edition has some additional scenes which were not in the original release. Worth a little extra money.
negative,A waste of film...: I agree with Mark Fantino. This may be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Not even the great cast could save the movie. Good actors can rarely overcome a screenplay that is this bad.
negative,"Indeed Just Another Dumb Blonde: Clearly, the producers just went along and jumped into the bandwagon. They found another ""dumb blonde"" (a formerly famous artist's daughter), gave her a make over, a song, placed her in some promotional lines, and here you have it, a produced ""artist"". There are plenty of these sorts out now to begin with, but what makes Hoku even more distressing is that her vocal range isn't very... agreeable. Then tune is mixed up in a blender with all other sorts and the lyrics... I won't even start with that. It's a cutesy little getup, but that's it."
positive,"Good read!: This was a good, romantic novel. If you like Diana Hamilton, Lynne Graham, Jane Porter, Michelle Reid, etc. books with strong Alpha Male characters, then you will love this one!! The hero and the heroine meet again after she secretly has his baby. They were separated because she found out he was engaged and his fiance set her up to look like she stole jewelry. Of course, he believed the evil fiance & cast the poor heroine out of his life so that she was forced to have the baby she conceived without his knowledge alone. Read it to see how he finds out he was wrong, gets the heroine to forgive him, etc., etc."
negative,"Dreadful book: If you are a Christian, don't spoil your money with this book. I tried to search the credentials of the so called ""reverend"" but only in the book I could find his true identification. The book tells the same known stories of the apocripha and is full of lies and misconceptions. I don't recommend it and I already deleted it from the memory of my computer. Since I bought the eletronic edition nobody else will grab the remains."
negative,"The worst movie I've ever seen about these 2 great pilots: too phoney, lots of errors in the way the movie was made, also bad lip syncing from the woman singer, they played them off as ruthless killers when in fact all other stories tell otherwise. One part shows the bullet shot to the top of his head while flying, but yet when you see him with his head bandaged up its wraped around the side of his head for a wound to the top."
negative,Stopped working after 2 months: Ok while it lasted. However this cord stopped working after two months. Save your money -- this is junk.
negative,"You are not saving any money: You aren't saving any being this adapter. I purchased this for a 12"" G4 Powerbook. The power it supplies goes on and off constantly. This can't be good for the computer. It certainly doesn't charge it. Don't waste your money on this Macally adapter. Try to find an original Apple adapter if you can."
positive,"Difficult made simple: I bought the book Friday, started to read it that day (after work), continued the reading Saturday, and by Sunday evening I had ported almost the whole website for my workplace from Struts to Cocoon!The book transforms a very complex subject to a comprehensible level, to the point that you will be Cocooning just after a few days like an expert!My advice: GET THE BOOK!RCS"
positive,"weird stuff: Dredge is different from anyone I've heard yet. I can't Tell what this guy is singing about. By far Dredge has some of the most modern, but beautiful music out. Young musicians. you can call it emo maybe. evn if you hate emo check this album out. I bought it knowing nothing about it. Bug Eyes is fantastic, even though I have no idea what it means."
negative,Not worth the penny it cost: The seller provided timely shipping. However the product is junk. The sound is muffled and intermittently goes up and down when I move the input cable. I guess you if you buy cheap you get cheap. I have since ordered a name brand device to cassette converter which I hope will work better.
positive,Would purchase from this seller the next time: The book arrived very soon after I ordered it. Its description was accurate and the price was great.
positive,"Stardust Memories: If you like all that pre-grunge grunge dressed up in outlandish costumes and enough make-up to cause Angela Bowie blush, you'll David and the Spiders ripping their way through their hits and a couple of covers including Mott the Hoople's ""All the Young Dudes"" and Lou Reed's ""White Light, White Heat.""Grungy and gaudy before either were cool!"
positive,"EXCELLENT!!!: Great spare power supply, the only con' is the excess of weat generated when you use it for a long time... but works great!"
negative,"I weep.: This collection of tunes is an experiment with rock. I'm loving Björk's vocals, all though over-produced to an inch of her life. This LP is too eclectic to be eclectic. Post seems an effort to please mainstream goons. The LP feels forced."
positive,"Can someone tell me what season the Zorro episode is on?: Could one of the Bob Newhart Show fans tell me what season the episode of Bob Hartley dresses as Zorro for a masquerade party,and ends up on the ledge of of a building is included on?Thank You."
negative,Stargate Continuum: Not bad but could have been a lot better. Overall it was dissapointing. They could have at least noted what happened to the Ori after leaving fans hanging with the series ending. Not worth buying.
negative,"A waste of time and paper...: This is a horrible. Do not waste your time. It is contrived to the point of being not interesting and adds nothing to the breadth of fantasy literature or even childrens literature.It is difficult to read as you feel the writer struggling with the thesearus button on his computer.Mr. Paolini may be a writer one day, but this one should not have been published and will plauge him throughout his professional career"
negative,"Sprinkled with sexual innuendoes: I am a great fan of Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea as I grew up with these films. Both movies are romantic and show the beauty of a simpler life. In the Continuing Story, Anne is not the young, attractive lady she once was and Gilbert has lost much of his handsomeness. Anne has a romantic intanglement with a Jack Garrison and it seems as though she is shown more with Fred Wright than with her beloved Gilbert. This moving is not heartwarming and sweet like its predecessors, but haphazard in plot. I do not recommend this movie to anyone wishing to see a clean movie, as it is sprinkled with sexual innuendoes."
negative,"Arkangel's Recording of Othello Disappoints: I bought this recording with high hopes. What better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right? Well, not with this recording. The cast is made up of ""distinguished actors,"" the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school. Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line. The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce! When there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out. For audio recordings, you need the best voices. Too bad Arkangel didn't realize this. My advice? Grind up these CDs and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums."
positive,"Worth seeing more than once: Jumanji is an excellent film. There is enough action to keep one's attention, and a great combination of suspense and comedy with some great acting by Robin Williams. It can be a little scary for younger children, because of the constant danger the children are in throughout the movie, but it was one I have watched several times and never get tired of it."
positive,"Beats out my Mach 3 Turbo hands down: I went from disposables to the Mach 3 Turbo when they sent me one in the mail, and i loved it, got so much closer. Now i use the Fusion exclusively. Some say the 5 blades is a gimmic, but i can feel a difference in that i dont cut myself at all, and the surface is wide enough to cut more at a time."
negative,"Disappointed: Keurig B70 Gourmet Single-Cup Home Brewing Systemis just a disappointment. It has some nice features but it just doesn't make a strong enough cup of coffee if you choose to make the largest cup. It makes a decent tiny cup.Using the same size K cup to make a small to xlarge cup just doesn't work. The brewing time is the same, so if it drips more water through the same amount of grounds, how can you get the same strength for the large cup of coffee? I bought the Senseo Supreme and it's great. You can insert 2 pods to make the large cup."
negative,"Some recipes are problematic: I'm not sure if these recipes were actually made by the author. Some don't fit into the jar, and some don't make sense. The magic bars recipe tells you to put all the dry ingredients into the jar. . . o.k., the graham cracker crumbs go in first (on the bottom). The cooking directions tell you to mix the graham cracker crumbs with butter and make a crust on the bottom of the pan, then pour the rest of the jarred ingredients over it. . . how exactly do you do that.My daughter is making lots of jars from this book - but we have yet to cook one - I'm a little afraid of what's going to happen.Also, some of the recipes are just the same recipe with a different name and the ingredients in a different order. . ."
negative,"Not Happy With This Camera: I have many digital cameras, thought I would try the V705.The anti blur technology does not work very good, if at all.Doesnt support high speed SD cards.Uses Hi Compression, no way to change it = low quality Pictures.Quick Time Video is not a good mode, I would like AVISCN Custom mode is a joke.I talked to Kodak about these things and they are sorry.I will stick with a Winner, hp R817."
positive,"Set it and forget it: The TiVo wireless adapter is easy to install: plug it into the back of your TiVo and you're ready to go. My only difficulty was in getting it to agree with myLinksys WRT55AG Dual-Band Wireless A+G Access Point + Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch, which seems like a common configuration. It was a frustrating half an hour before I was able to get everything to play nicely together. (The detection process wasn't as easy as I thought it would be in this plug and play era.) You definitely need to know how your network is set up and be prepared to play with your wireless network configuration application.That said, once I got everything working correctly, the thing has been extremely easy to use: in fact, I haven't had to do anything to it since we put it in. The additional TiVo features that come with always-on access may appeal to some; for us, knowing that we can remotely program a show in a short time frame and still catch it is pretty cool."
negative,Don't rent or buy this movie. at all: Not a nice movie at all. It does make any sense at all. Some parts are very scary and very grusome at times. Their is no Micheal Myers in this movie. It is not worth of time and money to see this movie. Other Halloween movies are better.
positive,"Another exceptional Harte work: I have been a professional in telecom for over 6 years and I have bought several of Harte's books. I read like them because of his clear, concise style. This books diagrams are really exceptional. I would recommend it to anyone in the field, no matter what level"
negative,"wrong book: They sent me the wrong book. It was The Berenstain Bears, Learn About Strangers, instead of The Stranger. It was disappointing!!"
positive,"Mest Destination Unknown review: i think the new mest CD is really a good CD. i am a regular punk listener, and this cd is really a jolly cd."
negative,"Be Warned, This EP Is Censored!: Ugh! I'm so disappointed! I love Lady Sovereign. I love all the songs on this EP. But I had no idea that they would be CENSORED on this disc! All curse words and objectionable phrases have been eliminated with editing, or in some cases, alternate lyrics. LAME! This EP should carry a label identifying it as a CLEAN version so that consumers know what they're getting. Strangely, there doesn't seem to be an Explict Lyrics version available. This seems to be it. If I am wrong, I apologize, and someone please correct me, but I haven't been able to find any listings indicating both edited and explicit editions exist, which is extremely frustrating. I have heard uncensored versions of these songs, so I know they are out there. Unfortunately, they are not presented on this disc. Awful.Five stars for Lady Sov and these songs when they're uncesnored. One star for the versions presented here."
negative,"misgivings: The bed needs air refilling more often than I thought it would- every 3 days at the most. So much so that if I didn't pump it, the bed would all be like a water bed with ""jelly-like"" feeling. To lessen this effect I situated it in a corner of the room against the walls. Further more, what surprised me was the round water condensation on the bed sheet just underneath my (head) pillow in the morning. But what confuses me is that in the evening the bed feels cold (or the air inside feels cold).What I like about it though is that the pump works real fast in inflating- although it is loud for an evening activity."
negative,"Nothing Electrifying about this Secret: Father Michener is plagued with worry for his dear friend and mentor Pope Clement XV.Clement is concerned with a starling secret that is hidden in the archives of the Vatican. He then sends Michener on a trip to unravel the mystery of the third secret that the Virgin Mary has reveled to three youngstersGripping page turner? No, the only reason why I kept turning pages was because I was highly expecting a blow out a secret to end all secrets but once reveled I was sorely let downInsights on the Vatican was nothing more than the writers own opinion which makes this book a decent fiction read , one that you can take on a long airplane trip to pass away the timeblah"
positive,"Value for money... Perfect size: I own this photo printer. It is small in size, but produces professional quality photos at a low operating cost."
positive,"I loved it!: I thought this was an awesome movie. Not only did they keep the main characters from first movie together, but they had better and cooler special effects and tied the this movie together with what happened in the first one. This movie had alot more action in it and more special effects.Also on this DVD is many many special features like interviews with just about everyone and an egyptian type dictionary. This DVD is packed with hours and hours of fun and interesting entertainment.But this DVD and enjoy the ride."
positive,"Good price, good night.: Decent product. I had to sleep on it for a few nights and I survived. It is comfortable enough to pass out on It stayed inflated the whole night and deflates well. It comes with a sack for storage, though my folding skills are pretty lame, so fitting it into the bag is a challenge for me."
negative,"Not wild about American literature.: I'm not a fan on American lit! To be truthful, when I had to read it in college, I did the Cliff Notes, and even THAT was B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!. I have tried reading it twice and don't make it past the first two pages. The movie? NOT!!! Don't go by me, though. Some things have got to be read. My American Lit. professor loved it. To each his own."
negative,"A book short of good story.: Harry Turtledove is not a rocket scientist, nor an expert in weapons,tactics and explosives. He is no diplomat,no tank commander, no fighter pilot and certainly not a horseman.Upon reading his worldwar series I was left well-educated, but only in the fine art of .... baby-burping."
positive,"Daddy says, ""Five stars!"": I shop with my 3-year-old daughter. She loves this book, and I also like it a great deal. The pictures are detailed enough to give us tangents for conversation -- we talk about what she'd like to buy next time we go shopping. I've even used the cashier page to start talking with her about money, and why I go to work (so we can pay for things we want to buy). And as the previous reviewer noted, it provides an awfully good role model, when the little girl puts treats back on the shelf!"
negative,"A misleading view of Basque cuisine: A pretty book with some nice pictures, but it does little to portray veritable Basque cuisine. I am a Spaniard from Catalunya who loves good food and knows the kitchen. I was bothered by many things in this book -- his overuse of butter, for instance... Gazpacho is a dish from southern and central Spain, not the Basque country. Gazpacho does not need an ""earthy"" flavor as Mr. Hirigoyen suggests by adding red beets (What an aberration!). The dish ""Hake San Sebastian"" is unheard of anywhere in the Basque country, unless he means his own version of the traditional ""Merluza en Salsa Verde"". ""Bacalao al Pil Pil"" is one of the most ancient and sophisticated dishes of the Basque country (possibly of Europe)and is taken for granted without giving it due respect... In sum, quite a disappointing and misleading view of Basque food."
negative,"Waste of money: The product worked fine on the first day and now it doesn't work as described on the advert. I've never been so sore (both side) in my entire life. I cannot wear it for more than 2h. Other then the product itself, the delivery system was also misleading I choose a 5-8 days delivery when i placed the order but the product was delivered a month later. What made me even more annoyed was the fact that I had to pay for the post charges because apparently the sender didn't use correct stamp or pay the full charge. :@"
positive,"Pay Attention to Track 2: ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" is a good song, but I think more attention should be placed on the second track, the unreleased ""Could It Be You."" ""Could It Be You."" is a throwback to old school R&B music which really works for the group.If you love the song ""Bye, Bye, Bye,"" definitely buy this cd single, but if you want to hear something a little different, and in many ways better, buy this cd single for ""Could It Be You."""
positive,"I passed the certification test with this book alone.: The information is redundant, and I believe that I read the information twice throughout the book because it was repeated in different sections; however, I did pass the test and I guess that is all that counts.The information organization is awkward, some information is unclear, and the exam objective checklist was useless because I had no idea on how most sections covered the exam objects; however, I just read it, and used the review questions so I did not forget the key points, and it worked.I would recomend this book before taking the $2,000 Microsoft class."
negative,Incorrectly advertised Playing Cards: These are not the cards that were shipped to me. I ordered Poker Size Super Size Index. The Vendor tells me that they are not made. Then why are they advertised?Somehthing is wrong!!!!
positive,"Great Whodunit!: I was introduced to this charming little mystery while a schoolboy, and the enthusiasm of my teacher (Agnes Hay) resulted in a lifetime passion for British history. If you're such a buff, you will thoroughly enjoy this fictional modern-day examination of the Murder of the Princes in The Tower of London. Delightful---you'll want to curl up and enjoy it all in one sitting!"
negative,"MK4: Just give up, this game is so bad i dont how it got a seal of quality. Its MK3 remade. choppy terrible graphics, horrible sound, moves, and everything else. I can't even tell which character im choosing!! You can tell they put noo effort into this game at all. If you want a fighting game try street fighter alpha on Gbc, and stay far away from this!!!"
negative,DON'T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!: In early December I ordered products from Sharper Image as Christmas gifts. Half of my order did not arrive and I never received notice as to why. Turns out I had to call them to find out the items were on backorder. I finally cancelled the order and a month and a half later THEY STILL HAVEN'T REFUNDED ME!Do yourself a favor don't buy from these guys they're comepletely disorganized.
positive,The best Batman of the three with Christian Bale: This is much better than The Dark Night or the Dark Night Rises. Bales role in Batman Begins was outstanding. It really shows the dark side of Batman and makes it believable. The next two were more corny and seemed to focus more on the effects and not the story.
negative,"Moonstruck: This being my all time favorite movie, I bought this DVD as a backup to one I already have. I was not so impressed as the main menu was different (look and music) and the contents indicated on the back cover of this ""deluxe edition"" were not there (recepies, etc) I fail to see what is so ""deluxe"" about it. I will always recommend this movie but maybe not the ""deluxe edition"" because it is nothing special. I also had problems starting it (I initially thought something was wrong with my DVD player. . .haven't watched it again as my original version is much better."
negative,WASTE OF MONEY: FOLLOWED THE CRAPY INSTRUCTIONS THE BEST WE COULD.WHEN WE PUT IT IN OUR PRINTER THE PAGES CAME OUT A TOTAL MESS. THEY HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY. THEY DONT TELL YOU HOW MUCH OF EACH COLOR TO PUT AND YOU HAVE NO GUIDE LINE. I THREWTHE KIT AWAY IT WAS NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY.
negative,Not my idea of a good read: I've read worse. But it takes a lot of mental energy to wade through all the commas and figure out the point of each paragraph. It seems a lot longer than 240 pages. I wouldn't have read it if I hadn't been forced to by the school. And the introductory thing is torture.
negative,"Unsatisfactory product: I bought this thinking it might help with friction-based discomfort. Since coming off of birth control, I've had dryness issues and painful sex. This product was not helpful. The feel is silky, yes, but not slick. It took a LOT of the product to get any kind of benefit, and even then it just felt weird. Afterward, it was very difficult to clean off, and left an ""after"" feel about which neither of us were pleased. I can't imagine wanting to be covered in it for a ""massage,"" either. I don't see the point of this product in any respect."
negative,"Please!: We had to read this book in English. The book is not at all suitable for us kids. For one, it is boring, and for two, the book has profanity, and it keeps on saying the same stuff over and over and over again."
positive,"worth reading: I read this for a paper in high school, and it was really good. It takes some effort to get through it, but in the end, it is totally worth it. this is one book that I read years ago and still think of often. I recently started reading it again, and I'm looking forward to being reminded of the parts I'd forgotten."
negative,"Hated it!!!: I'm sorry, but I did not like this film. I'm glad I did not pay to see this in theaters. I saw it on TV (cable), and was not pleased with the film at all. Bad acting, and a waste of film. The movie was not scary, and it was predictable. Truth is just watch the first 4 Freddy movies. Those are the BEST ones in the series."
negative,"Not much about Julia only Julie: Julie Powell is thirty some living in in New York City. One day she decides to make all the recipes in the Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French cooking, that over 500 recipes. Julie is not master chef by any mean. Needless to say it will a adventure. With help from Eric (her husband), friends and the people who are following her blog, Julie tires to do something that very few pepole have attempted to do.""Julie and Julia"" by Julie Powell is a cute book about trying to some that you have never done before. I had hoped that there be more about Julia Child but there wasn't. Overall ""Julia and Julie"" is a cute book but not a keeper."
negative,"Review of Artec Textureline Smoothing Serum: I ordered this particular product as a trial substitute for the ""Controlgel"" by Textureline, which has always been my first choice. It appears that the ""Controlgel"" is out of production. This ""Smoothing Serum"" is a poor substitute. My barber agrees. He got me on the ""Controlgel"" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the ""Controlgel"" product would come back. My barber and I won't buy any more of the ""Smoothing Serum."" What a WASTE!!"
negative,gooey: I approached this album with great hopes of sinking my teeth into some great Catalan folk music. But i was disappointed. I listened some more but i was still disappointed. This album rarely resolves into something that doesn't sound like a yellow/grey goo.The vocals are (vaguely) pretty but too breathy and indistinct for much emotion to be carried. And the music sounds like it has been pulped and reconstituted resulting in bland characterless sound. There is some interesting subtleties - the gentle drum pattering can be engaging.Overall though an underwhelming experience.
negative,"COMPLETE JUNK: For the first six months I absolutely loved this machine. The ease of making a single cup of coffee throughout the day made it vastly superior to making a whole pot that lost flavor as time went on. However, after about six months the machine started making 4 ounce cups rather than 8 ounce cups. I have used only filtered water since day one and had descaled the machine as well to prevent any mineral buildup. After numerous calls to Keurig and researching the issue on the web I could not change the short cupping problem. It seemed as though the water pump was just giving out. At about 8 months the machine finally stopped working altogether. Have seen reviews of the Keurig OfficePro line that are positive and have decided to give that one a try. While supposedly containing a noisier water pump the machine does not seem to stop working suddenly. Will update this review after using the Keurig OfficePro."
positive,great product: I use a fountain pen on occasion so I find this ink to be great - not messy - easy to fill the pen -
negative,"expensive mistake: I was very dissappointed in this disc. Syntesized instruments don't even come close to reproducing Boleros majesty,not to mention many were out of key,and it was a poor quality attemt at reproducing the sounds of the symphony instuments!!! Don't waste your money,I'm sorry I bought it."
positive,Very helpful: This book was given to me years ago when I was pondering a new direction. It was so helpful that a few years later I lent my copy to a friend who loved it so that she bought it for herself and her friends. This recent purchase was for another friend at a crossroads.
negative,"Rock formation, rock formation, new character...: Rock formation, rock formation, new character... etc.The sad part is, the rock formations are more interesting than the new characters. Just reread the first three and skip the rest of the series."
positive,"Really a fun read: Enjoyed this a lot.....Sex with Kings was good....this was even better....wow, really popped the top off of Princess Diana, but I still like her. Well written, really enjoyed the authors style of writing....seriously, if you like the inside scoop (even if it was 400 years ago)....BUY THIS!!!!!"
positive,"Terry Pratchett is a great author!: This is another book in the Discworld series, and the second book in the Sam Vimes/Watch story-line. It introduces a couple of characters that become regulars. Well-written and a joy to read."
positive,"Baby loves it: It's a good tool to have in the crib when teaching your baby to fall asleep on his or her own. The music alone lasts 15 min, and doesn't drain the battery. Music combined with other effects doesn't last as long. My son is 7 mos old and we are changing the battery for the first time. It's been an enjoyable accessory in the nursery."
positive,Awesome: The book was great and i just love the golem part when he always says my precious and the the riddle game
positive,"Help!In major confusion, WHAT TO BUY???!!!: Please i can't decide. I have NEVER seen, played, or touched an Advanced Pet. At toywiz.com com, they have all the pets you would want. Pet1 ,Pet2 ,progress pet.wHAT TO BUY! I read everything i can to find out. I have $91. I could buy almost all of them. But... which one to buy?! this one sounds okay. I never heard anything about the progress pet. But it sounds so good. So if you are willing to help me, post it on the next review. Then i will decide out of all three, which is the best, and until i find out, i will tell all megaman fans, about the best p.e.t.!!"
positive,"Randy is a dog's best friend...: I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. There are few people I have encountered that are as dedicated to a cause as Randy seems to be. His devotion and tenacity are to be commended. He is doing such a great service to the city of St. Louis. There are a lot of us out there that would've never even realized there was such a stray problem in this country. I am so glad to have read this book and to be more informed on the conditions these dogs have to live in. It has been said over and over about this book, but the prevailing message is that one man can make a difference and seeing that proven in Randy's case is a great motivator for the rest of us. For anyone who loves dogs and/or loves inspiring stories, read this book."
negative,"ATTENTION TEACHERS!: I had to read this book in my sophomore Honors English class. Basically, it is about book-burning and the importance of books. BUT IF YOU WANT TO IMPART TO YOUR STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF READING, LET THEM READ SOMETHING THAT IS AT LEAST INTERESTING! Instead of having your students read Fahrenheit 451, let them read DUNE (and don't say it's bad because the movies were!), or HARLAN ELLISON, or PHILIP K. DICK. NOT this pocket-protector, suit and tie business writer, Bradbury. I've tried reading some of his other stuff. He's not that good. This book was okay, but nothing great and certainly nothing I would spend money on or read again. Have you ever heard of ""show, don't tell""? This book only TELLS why books are important. But let the student read a good book and that will SHOW them why books are important. This is one of many rotten books that I have read in High School. It's no wonder, with book selections like these, that students don't read and are illiterate."
positive,Great Book: I thought it was a great book. It's filled with a lot of very useful information and it's always great to get info direct from casting directors since they are the ones who we all need to audition for!
positive,"Set of four Free standing card holders: Haven't had an opportunity to use them yet, but after examining them they appear to be a quality product , I'm sure they will be just fine and work as expected."
negative,"Absolute tripe!: This is the most worthless waste of paper I have ever laid my eyes on. To say that behavior is biological is to say that human beings are software driving bodies. Women and men behave the way they do because of SOCIALIZATION and there is only minimal impact from normal physical differences (insanities are excepted, as they are aberrations)."
negative,This Sucks: I waited all week for this over priced shirt. I only bought it because I couldn't find another button down shirt in eggplant and I needed the color for an event this week. The shirt arrived and they sent me the wrong style shirt. Its a polo shirt. Doesn't even look like the picture. Now I'm screwed for the event this week. Hella Lame.
positive,"Each read is like peeling layers of a rose: What greater journey than to delve into the human heart? Every emotion one can nurture there is here, bared and examined.Hester, at once forthright and complex, serves as our guide, as she wanders the lambrynth of her own private neart.That we can fall, sin, disappoint and still find redemption in confession make the message of The Scarlet Letter a most comforting tract for out day."
positive,sometimes they come back: It was a great movie as I remembered it as it came out the first time. I recommend it was good.
negative,pampers fell apart: I was very dissapointed in the quality of the last batch of pampers that I bought. 1/4 of the diapers fell apart as I was putting them on my daughter. I switched to Huggies because of this and have not bought any more pampers.
negative,If narrators matter to you be warned !: The product detail states Conner O'brien is the narrator (whom my daughter wanted) but it wasn't him after all... it's Scott Brick... I ordered this under the assumption it was Conner and wouldn't have had I known... This may not be a big deal breaker for some people but if your going to put the name of the narrator in the product details at least get it right... Scott Bricks voice is irratating to my daughter... different things bother different people and we need the right information to make an informed decision before buying a product.... The book how ever is fantastic if you don't mind a slow start... get past the first chapter and you'll love it as millions have...thanks for listening.....
positive,"A wonderful read for all ages: As I began the first chapter of this book, I thought I had made a mistake in purchaing it. It started off kind of ""goody-goody"" sounding and written for young adults. But I gave it a chance, and it paid off. As I got further into the book, I was hooked. I fell in love with the characters and kept turning the page to see what would happen next. It's a classic story for every woman. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my 8-year-old cousin.The story is essentially about 4 sisters as they grow up. Each sister is unique, with different ideas and priorities. ""Watching"" them grow up through out the book is entertaining and heart-warming."
positive,"This is Kerouac's real masterpiece!!: I didn't much care for ""On The Road"" after the first 50 pages or so and i'd pretty much thought that this great ""Beat Writer"" was nothing but hype, but after reading ""The Dharma Bums"" I now believe Kerouac is one of the greatest writers of modern times. READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
positive,"Working together: These games have been carefully designed so that the players ""work together"" to find solutions to a variety of non-violent situations. While competitive games can be good for children, it is also very important for these children to learn how to rely on each other. These games are top rated for this learning experience."
positive,"The greatest Christmas story every: This is the greatest Christmas story every made or told. I only buy ""Charlie Brown"" Christmas trees now. My wife hates them but she doesn't understand what Christmas is all about."
negative,"Not for me: Don't care for the story line.Too, distasteful and hardly worth reading even if it was the last book I had.."
positive,"I was told I can listen to the radio at a reasonable volume: To say the least Beavis & Butthead's creator Mike Judge makes you laugh till you cry again. Only this time its about work. I mean from begining to end you will laugh. I thought I was gonna drop dead about mid ways through. My favorite character without a doubt is Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), who is put through hell at work, even though he was laid off five years earlier, and by some glitch in the payroll system, he still recieves a paycheck! (I mean he's hilarious)! Im gonna go by saying the same thing Milton always said to his bosses, ""Okay, I'll set the building on fire"". Dont Miss This!"
negative,"This is a camera?? Sold in retail stores???: I wish I could rate this camera -9999999999999999999999999999999. Actually what I really wish is to mound all of the Vivitar Vivicam 55 cameras up in a pile and BURN THEM. Anyway, I found this camera at Walmart thinking it should be good for the $20 price tag they were asking. When I first opened this wannabe camera I noticed the buttons were very cheap. More than half the pictures taken were either blurry and/or yellowed. Don't bother trying to create a video with this thing unless you like a still frame video. I brought it back after I did some research and found the Logitech C310 Webcam for several dollars more here on Amazon(which has HD!). This is the worst camera i have EVER used. Live and learn, and never buy anything made by Vivitar. Shop around and spend a few extra dollars for a better camera. If not, you get what you pay for."
positive,"First impressions are deceiving.: I really was looking forward to the release of this CD and must say was a little disappointed the first time I listened to it. I liked Invisible and This is the Night because they were familiar but was hoping for other songs Clay sang on American Idol. However, after listening to the CD several times, I can't decide which song is my favorite. I listen to it over and over at work. The thing that I find incredible is that I never get tired of listening to it like I do my other CDs. It gets better every time I hear it."
positive,"Happily Hooked: This book is wonderful if you are new to crochet, or even if you're not. I learned to crochet with this book. The instructions and illustrations were so much better than the ones I had seen elsewhere. You really can teach yourself through this book. I am a very visual person and with a little practice and repetition, I learned the basics and then was able to move on to the other stitches. The projects are really cute and trendy. The first thing I made was a purse and although I had a little trouble with it at first (mainly because it wasn't going the way I thought it should), I realized you need to trust the instructions!! I recommended this book to several friends and they've all enjoyed it. I always keep this handy whenever I'm crocheting. It's a great reference book as well as a project book."
negative,"Completely Worthless: These may work for some people, but for others like me, they're worthless. The fit was horrible and they did not stay in my ear. They also caused my Jawbone Prime to protrude far enough so that the front part no longer touched my face (which is required for their noise reduction circuitry to work). I threw these away and am now using the stock earbud with the ear hook.These are designed for people with a certain ear shape. If your ears don't conform to this shape (which is likely the case for many people), these will be useless. If you want these, I suggest buying from a local store where you might be able to try them on, or at least to return them without having to pay return shipping."
negative,"Dreadful: I borrowed this from the library before buying, and am I ever glad I didn't shell out the money for this program. The music is tinny and the singing tuneless. The words are more often shouted than sung. The children's pronunciation is awful, even to my non-native ear. Finally, the constant back-and-forth between French and English only confuses; immersion in the target language is the better choice, particularly for children. ..."
negative,"Cant get the stopper to stay: So excited to get this.. but have tried and tried to get the white stopper to stay where it should. Others have tried as well, but no luck it keeps slipping out. Now maybe I am doing something wrong, but when something which seems simple takes so much energy time and effort, well something is wrong with the product. I have not had the joy of using it yet as it does look strong and of good quality. Sigh."
negative,"Don't waste your time or your money: Unfortunately, The Shelters of Stone is a major disappointment. Only once before have I failed to finish a book because it was just too bad to continue - this now makes twice. None of the books beyond Clan of the Cave Bear ever entirely lived up to Auel's first, though at least Valley of Horses was decent if not as engrossing. This book, however, is not only boring, but the language is stilted and bordering on silly as Ayla (whom I used to like as a character) ponders every single detail of life she notices and seems to feel a need to explain it as well. Why did I get it? I was hoping that Auel had returned to her earlier style after taking so many years to complete this book. On the bright side, at least it's thick enough to make a good door stopper."
negative,"...jusr miserable: This book promotes everything that a woman should not be: stupid and submissive. I am sad for Gillian, I am totally repulsed by Broderick - a possessive and rude pig, and I am bored by the book that reaks of a day-time soap (you know what is going to happen 10 pages in advance). I am sorry, Ms. Garwood if this is an ideal love for you for it surely seems like an abuse to me. I am truely sad that women still find books like that exciting and interesting."
positive,Good Organizer: This is a good organizer for small projects or just keeping track of a temporary project both home and office.
positive,"Wonderful: Comfortable right out of the box. Well made. Durable. Can't vouch for the waterproofing of them, as I have learned many moons ago.....no shoes are waterproof. I refuse to test them, once you do...they never seem to be the same."
positive,"Makes sense: The Smart Spot made sense to me. I liked the business stories and explanations about energy in the ""physical world."" Instead of pop-psychology, there are plausible answers based on what the author apparently ""sees"". What's more, the techniques seem to be within reach.But does the stuff described in Smart Spot really work? I tried the procedure for grounding in a meeting and was pretty surprised at how much it helped.I wish there were more ""energy explanations"" in the book. North obviously perceives more than most of us, and I wish she had taken more risks to explain what happens on the non-verbal plane. Maybe her next book. (I also wish she would attend my next meeting and tell me what really went on.)This book has great ""visualizations"" that are not intimidating and that actually seem to work."
negative,"Not particularly moving: It's a nice, fast summer read, and I must admit to shedding a tear or two, but overall, I didn't like it.I don't think I'll be reading more James Patterson. For one thing, he is totally unconvincing as a 35-year-old female. I mean come on. There's this one line about an ""upside-down ponytail"" and it almost made me quit reading and throw the book against the wall in frustration. Funny how little things like that can throw off the whole experience. Generally for me, this was not dense enough to be a real romance. Badabing badaboom, they're in love. But why? No one knows.Anyway, if you're in the mood for a fluffy read, you might be ok with this one. Otherwise, skip it."
positive,getting into the spirit: a fascinating and stimulating account that seems to put things into the proper perspective. Makes the myths all the more enjoyable.
positive,"Holy cow!: From the moment the CD began I had goosebumps. It showed an incredible range of emotion and creativity.True story: It was actually given to me by a friend who worked at a radio station. It was a promotional copy and he had not listened to it before giving it to me.After hearing the first track, he slapped his forehead, Homer Simpson style."
positive,Whistle Lanyards: What can you say: it's just a lanyard. I buy these for all my volleyball referees on the NYC Board because of the good quality.The seller was very efficient and quick with the order - a great pleasure to deal with. I will buy from them again next year.
positive,"Cap in Terrell, Tx.: I really do like using Mosby's Medical Dictionary because it is an easy print to read. I am currently taking an Internet course in Medical Terminology. When I don't understand a word I quickly look it up in Mosby's Medical Dictionary for more clarification. The graphic pictures are excellent. In addition, I will be purchasing Mosby's Medical, Nursing, & Allied Health Dictionary."
positive,Great: Insert the CD and listen to the first track. This is everything Nightwish is known for. Any fan will love this album
positive,"This is a MUST HAVE!!!! Couldn't live without: This is one of the best things I ever bought for our daughter. It is very soothing and she definitely uses it to help her fall asleep. When we lay her down in her crib, she may fuss at first, but then when we turn the aquarium on she loves it! If you put it on music and lights only it will play for 10 minutes. Once our daughter learned to turn it back on she loved it even more! One night not too long ago she played it for 2 hours straight in the middle of the night until she fell back asleep. I cannot praise this product enough."
negative,pampers baby dry: It gets soggy in no time and leaks out big time . The product has lost its quality .I will never buy it again .
positive,"Solid and cheap: The ESV is in whole one of the best translations of the century. This classic trade bible format is good for people who need a Bible fast, but will eventually purchase a better one later on. Not good for notes, and it is recycled paper, so it would be best to use it for Bible study (for those who don't bring theirs) or just as a handout."
positive,"Mad Max (1979): A catalyst in the Contemporary Era revenge-actioner movement, this George Miller flick features a young, then-unknown Mel Gibson in only his second movie role, as top-cop Max Rockatansky. After a pursuit of Max's ends in a fiery crash, killing the pursued (a biker named Nightrider), he is targeted by motor-terrorists for the death of their fellow gang member. When Max goes on a vacation trip with his wife and their infant son, they are attacked by the malicious, vengeful mob, leaving Max a childless widower hungry for his own violent revenge--and that's exactly what he gets. Set in post-apocalyptic Australia, this film, made for a meager $400,000, held the highest cost-profit ratio of any film in Hollywood history until 1999, when Blair Witch surpassed its mark."
positive,"Back to a child once again: The family sat around the TV, popped popcorn, everyone snuggled up to one another, wish upon that star and enjoyed a childhood classic."
positive,"i spit on my review: i've been watching sexploitation,""t&a"" horror films since my early teen years. i believe these films were made to get into the viewers head and mess with it. i spit on your grave dose just that. i don't believe this movie or other movies like it will compel you to reinact any of the violence or torture, but it will affect you emotionally.it will also affect how you relate to people.those of you that have a strong belief in god stay away!this movie is nothing more then a portrait of men[the black part of our hart & soul] what we have to fight against unleashing upon women.the saving grace of movies like this for me are hot naked women putting men in their place.if that kind of stuff is up your alley, two of my other favorite movies are: blood sucking freaks & show girls. watch at your own risk."
positive,"Beginner woodsman manual: This is basically a beginners guide to traveling, camping, and surviving in the woods. Covers a wide variety of topics from cabin building to snowshoeing. My biggest takeaways from the book are to always have an axe and blanket when traveling in the woods. Also, never explore unfamiliar areas without a compass and a means of fire creation.Don't expect a story. This is a manual."
negative,"Disappointing: I'll keep this short. The book was an awful read save the last ten pages. Everything before that is terribly uninteresting. It is only once he has been sentenced and awaits his end that it becomes something worth flipping through. I have the utmost respect for Albert Camus, but this is dribble."
positive,"Charming Perfomances!: Not a great film nor is it very original but Someone Like You is a very charming look at trying to find Mr Right. Ashley Judd looks breathtaking and takes her role and gives her the right amount of strength, charm, and intelligence in what could have a been a very boring pathetic role. Greg Kinnear does what he can with a badly written role. Hugh Jackman is charming and likeable as the womanizing roomate of Ashely Judd. The chemistry between the two is amazing and it's the one thing that really carries the film. I only wish the film focused more on the relationship between these two then between the relationship between Ashley and Greg. It has a predictable and happy ending and is certain to please all lovers of romantic comedies."
positive,"Gripping!: I was enthralled immediately and absorbed through out the book. It's a fascinating, well told story which was even more interesting because it's historically accurate. I read a lot and haven't read a book I liked this much in a long time. It's just a great read."
positive,"An Absolute Classic!!: I was 9 years old when this movie came out. I loved it then, and now at 25 years-old,I love it even more!! There is nothing negative to say about this movie whatsoever. The art is beautiful and the story fits the characters well. It is a must have for anyone who collects anime."
positive,"Wow, this toy is much smarter and funner than you think!: This toy is really fun and smart! There are 4 catagories that the item you choose for it to guess can be: 1.vegetable 2.animal 3.mineral 4.otherIt asks you 20 questions like: Does this bring joy to people? And others. Then you can answer Yes,No,Sometimes, or Unknown.But all of us are very surprised how fun and smart it is!I think that you should buy it if your interested!It has worked very good for me, the only miner problem I had is that the restart button was jammed but you don't use it much and we work it with a pen. I hope you get it and enjoy it!"
positive,"GOOd: a gift for my friend he loved it is a child movie and could find it anywhere but here, great price and fast shipping"
negative,Not worth your money!!: I bought this product according to the good reviews and its not worth your time and money. The product feels like putting a piece of cheap tape and nothing coming out. Dont buy this product!! Its very cheap!!
positive,This book is great!: This book is an excellent novel for those who are looking for adventure. Dumas is a brilliant writer.
positive,"Clay Aiken ""Measures"" up to expectations: This album is excellent and I would recomend it to anyone who has any sense of taste in music. Clay delivers an exquisite debut CD with powerful vocals and lyrics. A great buy and well worth the few dollars required to buy the CD."
negative,"1 hour of static rain noise: Ok i admit. I'm not a brain music expert. I really am not sure whether this CD emits sounds that will make me more creative or open up my alpha brain waves like the cover says. I've tried and I don't really feel any different. And yet I'm admitedly intrigued by the warnings on the label that say ""do not use while operating heavy machinery"" and such. However, the cd provides only a single song - if you call it that - that lasts for an hour - and its really just a low thumpy staticy rain noise that remains fairly constant and does not ebb and flow. Nothing really mind blowing if you ask me. Also, the packaging looks more backyard than mass production leading me to believe the $23 price is also a bit high. Ok experts, flame away! Tell me I'm simply not smart enough to get it. Perhaps that is the case... either way I guess i expected something different."
positive,"LET THE REVIEWS TELL THE STORY: ""Beautifully descriptive, nonstop action novel on the Hindu epic Ramayana, artfully weaving in strong themes on the environment and peace,"" American Library Association's Booklist."
negative,"Bad copies!: I've been a faithful user of Gillette razor blades and replacement cartridges for many years! But, these replacement cartridges are the worst Gillettes I've ever used! The blades are dull big time, some cartridges have missing blade strips, the lubricating strip is green all the way (not green and white underneath), the orange color of the metallic part surrounding the trimmer is a darker than on my usual Gillette Fusion cartridges! I am pretty sure (200%) that these are copies, bad copies probably made in China! This is unacceptable! I got them from AllTheTimeWholesale through Amazon; I will no more buy my Gillette Fusion replacement cartridges from them! What a scam!"
negative,"not so great: My cat can still splash water out of it after the cont. is filled. However, when water level goes down some there is then only about 1/4 inch of water in the bottom of the bowl for cat to drink. Not so great."
negative,"Unimaginative: You need to hear it for yourself and decide..Don't let other's hype sway you..Which is worse?? A Christian band trying to imitate the world or a worldly band trying to imitate a Christian band?? As Christians, we need to be the Innovators that the world wants to imitate..Imitation is the best the devil can offer!!!"
positive,try: get some help and give it a chance. skeleton's key is good and if you can get the tapes then you're half way there.
negative,"formula reading in the ""hardy boys"" tradition: Although MacGregor craftily weaves in a bit of historical facts to entertain, they are extremely general. Otherwise, the book reads like a Hardy Boys novel, deserving little attention from the adult audience. The novel works as a young adult novel; however, it seems marketed as more of an adult novel"
positive,Hi-Tec Boots Work for Me: Had an older pair that lasted for about 6 years. I loved them and sought to replace them with the same model. I got them and they broke in pretty quick. I am happy!
negative,Way too much Catholicism: I liked The Amber Room and LOVED The Romanov Prophecy. I was prepared for another terrific book. What a disappointment. This book is far more a fictional in-depth look at the selection of a Pope than a mystery thriller. I found it too far-fetched to be remotely believable.The flyleaf says Steve Berry is at work on his next book. Let's hope it's better than this one.
positive,"Alternate Italian Renaissance Light History: Any book set in the Renaissance is pretty much bound to be a complex amalgam of plots and counter plots. This book lives up to its setting in history. I was cautious in approaching a book that was written by three authors, expecting writing dissonance and perhaps some plot danglies. But the authors did a very good job of developing characters and coherent plot. I didn't expect anything along the lines of a serious historial novel, and so was not disappointed. I would almost classify this as a Young Adult book because the majority of the main characters are in the process of coming of age. This is light fare that is well enough written and well plotted to engage your attention. Very light on the fantasy element, and light on characterization - - but don't think that any of the characters are cardboard cutouts. The plot is woven well enough and moves fast enough that deep characterization isn't missed. Well done entertainment."
positive,"Best DVD docummentary yet !: Regardless of how much I love this movie, it is the extras in this edition that really surprised me. The 1 hour docummentary has got to be best I've seen in a DVD yet and the reason is very simple: few filmakers have gone through such lenghts to bring their vision to the screen as James Cameron has with the Abyss. To think he went even further with Titanic ! It's a shame that DVD edition is so very plain."
positive,"Excellent Garlic Roaster for 1.5 to 3 heads of garlic: I love roasted garlic. Lately I've taken to making garlic butter with 3 heads of roasted garlic and chopped up fresh basil.The only ""complaint"" that I have with this roaster is the size. Two heads of garlic is a tight squeeze with wasted space. A third head, broken up, can sometimes be made to fit.I would gladly trade mine for the larger version. But, if you're not overly addicted to lots of garlic all at once, this is a great product."
positive,"Another classic in disguise: While the Comanche is an interesting rocket, the biggest attraction to this kit is that it's a perfect starting point to ""clone"" an Estes Condor. (The single glider version.) The main body tube and nose cone are the exact pieces that you would have received in a Condor kit if this was 1978. That said, the Comanche is a neat rocket when it works right, but I've seen a lot of them built and very few work the way they're supposed to. Getting two stages to light isn't exactly easy. Getting three is quite a challenge."
negative,"This is a gem, for a CERTAIN KIND of reader: If you know it all already, this is a good book for you to buy. If you are looking for grammar instruction, look elsewhere. This little book was written 75 years ago and it has things worth thinking about, but it is not a grammar book, or a book on speaking, or a book on writing. I just bought it and am delighted to rummage about in it. It's a GEM. It's worth the money by a mile and a half. I gave it two stars only to not be lost in the shuffle. Buyers often don't look at 50 rave shill reviews but they'll look to see who doesn't like and why. So maybe I caught some readers. This is a good buy IF you KNOW IT ALL. It's not instruction, it's food for thought."
positive,"The Unknown R&B Soldier: I knew Wayne Cochran by the single Going Back to Miami. Despite no charted on Hot 100, it was airplayed on Costa Rica's first Top 40 radio station back in 1967. Next year a girlfriend honored me with the generic Wayne Cochran vynil for Chess Records which I lost. Those songs are the reason why I kept looking for WC on CD till I found out this Australian release, so what to think...? I dig Wayne's energy on up-tempo songs but the ballads ""When My Baby Cries"" and ""I'm Leaving Up to You"" got a pure classic R&B with those musicians there. You see, not all that shine's is gold, but this is gold for those who appreciate such rock and soul or blue eyed soul style."
positive,"Not the only book you'll ever need: This is quite a handy book, there were a lot of interesting practical things that I didn't know or wish I knew or been wanting to know. Many of which includes:* Useful Air Travel Tips* How to find water in the desert* How to treat a venomous Snake Bite* How to perform the Heimlich Maneuver* How to perform CPR* Basic First Aid (to treat basic ailments)* Poisonous Plant Guide (what/which part of plant is poisonous & poison symptoms)* Common Ailments and their Remedies* Foot and Hand Reflexology* Acupressure Chart* Yoga Positions* Serving Size Chart* Chicken Soup Recipe* Table Setting* Dance Steps (for Waltz, Tango, Rumba, Foxtrot)* Palmistry Chart* Sun Dial* Wonders of the World Checklist* Learn to Drive a Stick Shift* How to Change a TireAll in all, it's a real nice practical book, but not the only book I'll ever need. It's one of those books that you read once, look over it once more later on, then forget about it."
negative,"in the crappy tradition of houseonhauntedhill and 13 ghosts: there are some pretty crappy haunted house movies out there like 1999's House On Haunted Hill and 2001's 13 Ghosts, people who find those scary and intelligent should be shot because their a heap of junk. this one is alittle bit above both but the story and characters drop it in some parts. Lili Taylor at the end is horrible but Liam Neeson and Owen Wilson add some spark and some comedy to it especially Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones is ok as well as the bisexual. strictly a horrible remake done by DeBont after the classic original"
positive,"Super Great Deal! I Love these Cables: I must say, I was a little sceptical about these cables, because they were so inexpensive. They work just as good as more expensive cables. I have seen PS3 HDMI Cables in the stores for up to $99.00! An audio/visual person I know informed me that an HDMI Cable is an HDMI Cable regardless of what materials are used, etc. As he explained, the signal remains the same.I highly recommend these cables, I purchased two since they were so cheap."
negative,"Problems with HP laptop: I bought this product to assisst in upgrading my HP laptop hard drive. I was able to clone my old drive, but when I replaced the old drive with the new, the laptop wouldn't boot. Upon further investigation (and help from an engineer friend), I have learned that HP has a hidden system partition, and the cloning software was unable to access these tiles. So I'm stuck until I can get expert help, and even then, it may not work. Bottom line is it's not so EZ after all."
negative,"The most boring recording EVER!: This is, in my opinion, techno at it's best. However, because it is techno, it's AWFUL. Every track here is about twice as long as it should be, and each gets boring after the first minute. I despise techno because it's always the same thing over, and over, and over. And over. And over. The sampling just rips off other artists, and what little new musical ingenuity exists is buried so deeply in the mix that all you hear is the damn drums and the same samples replayed indefinitely. A little bit of lyrical change would be nice too, instead of ""Rock y'all, gonna stock y'all, to the beat y'all, the bodyrock y'all"" twenty seven times over. And over. And over. And over. And over."
negative,Nice to look at but thats all: I received this machine for my birthday on november 12. Today is december 6 and I just returned it to the store and got a new one. After about a week and a half it stopped making full cups of coffee. I thought it was just a fluke until it started sounding like an airplane was taking off on my kitchen counter. After reading all the negative things about keurig in general I am very happy this was a gift and I did not shell out 150 on a coffee maker that craps out in 2 weeks.
negative,"LESS THAN MEDIOCRE: I was in the US Navy, and I found this movie absurdly unrealistic. First of all, no one as old as Charlton Heston was ever involved in actual battles in WW2. His acting, as usual, was lousy, his age betrayed the film. I find elder actors degrading the heroes of WW2 repugnant. I gave this video away to the local Goodwill store."
positive,"SEXTETTE: Don't Let This Happen To You!: That Greta Garbo retired from films in her mid thirties did more to keep her memory and ""the mystique"" alive than anything else she could have done. That Mae West decided to film ""Sextette"" in the late Seventies, when she was in her mid eighties, is the flip side of Garbo: the Baby-Jane-Norma-Desmond syndrome descended upon a new world with new values. And to pair West with the young Timothy Dalton and expect the audience to take the romance seriously further complicates this already messy film. Part musical, part comedy, part Grand Guignol, this film should be seen for the five-star lesson it presents: know when to gracefully retire, leaving only the fondest of memories, Garbo-like, captured on film forever."
positive,"Movie more true to the comics: finally, a batman movie true to the comics.i didn't like the 4 previous batman movies but i loved this movie!! i'm picky when it comes to batman but this one remains true to the character. i have the deluxe edition dvd and its great.highly recommended for ""real"" batman fans."
positive,xtreme white plus bulbs: the piaa bulbs are much brighter and whiter than OEm bulbs. Very pleased with them.
negative,Pictures not what they appear to be.....: very disappointed in this item. it sits in my basement and will never be used. I assumed I ordered the entire tent structure based on the photos upon purchasing the item. turns out it was just the 'net'I would absolutely love to return this and get my money backThank you
positive,"Good Value: This was a great product, just what I needed and just as pictured. I use these to sit on a couch and watch video on my computer and they work great."
negative,"Strange words to be used in a fantasy: Page 304. ""Tell her to wait another five minutes.""[ Murtagh wants Eragon to tell the Dragon Saphira to wait 5 minutes before coming to rescue them. Wait.. Dragon can't tell time...Page 411. Ajihad:""Indeed, they never fully....allowed them to police their kingdom."" the word ""police"" is kind of too modern to appear in a fantasy book.Page 470. The modern time concept appears again in the book. ""The Urgals will arrive in a matter of hours."" Unless they have magical watches, they can't properly tell time, can they?"
positive,"TGN 3: When I first heard this CD, I loved it from the get go. The music is very hypnotic, while at the same time it infuses you with a lightening bolt of high powered trance trip'n. This makes an excellent medium for visualization (the internal kind, not the video kind), meditation, and just trancing out. Oh yeah, and dance. Dance, dance, and dance to this badboy. Even at 56 years old, I can feel the electric current going through me like I was made of copper. Did I mention it's downright sensuous too...oooeee baby, it sure'nuff is."
positive,Great trilogy: The dark knife trilogy is by far one of the best trilogy's ever! With great action and suspense these are must watch movies!
negative,"Dummy Scared the Be-Jesus Out of Me: Oh, God, do I remember seeing the dummy's face in the ads. That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn't. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I've seen the ad, I've nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!"
positive,"Wonderfully romantic book that sweeps you to Italy: THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world."
negative,Eh: James Patterson lost his touch in this book. The romance seemed too forced and the plot didn't flow as smoothly as you would expect it would from a Patterson novel. The fact the the reverend is shacking up with a married women is never discussed. Jennifer becomes romantically involved with a man she knew when she was too young to remember him and the apprehensions about becoming involved so recently after her first husband's death are only lightly discussed. The story seems too forced and Patterson should stick to mystery thrillers.
negative,"Doesn't work!: We have ordered this DVD set 2 times and we have had to send it back each time. We also bought a set a SAMS CLUB today and it doesn't work either. Yes, we tried to play all 3 discs and in every DVD player in the house. We LOVE the movies and wanted to share the fun with our son who is now so disappointed. Save your receipt!"
negative,"remingtons don't last long: this was the 2nd remington shaver (not refurbished, but brand new) we got for my husband and it's the 2nd one to stop holding a charge before 1.5 years (warranty is 2 years - and what a pain it is to arrange to get it serviced). we will NOT be buying a remington ever again."
negative,"Terrible!: I purchased this thing in August, used it ONCE, and the belt broke. No biggie. Ran to the hardware store and bought another. It worked the next 2-3 times I used it, and now it's overheating and otherwise useless. This thing is very, very cheaply made. It feels like a toy. There are better vacuums out there for the price."
positive,"Classic story, new twist.: I have seen this movie at least four times and every time, I cry when she leaves the castle (if you've seen the movie, you know what I am talking about). I am not overly senimental but the poignancy and Ms. Craven's lovely voice make that scene superb. But that is how the whole movie is. Though overshadowed by Rogers and Hammerstein's version and Disney's animated, this is just as good if not better then either of them. I strongly recommend this for anyone who believes that while true love does exist, it is not as easy as the fairy tales make it seem."
negative,"Don't bother...: We got this as a gift and have used it 0 times. It's expensive and poorly designed. A large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper, easier to fold, and nicer looking."
positive,"Definite ""thumbs up"": An excellent little collection of spells. Not wicca or CM, so if you're looking for those you might be more pleased with some other selection. But it's good solid folk magic, largely of a mixed African and European flavor.I wouldn't say the book is indispensable for the advanced or intermediate practitioner. It's largely addressed at the beginner. But it's a pleasant read, well organised, and contains more useful practical spells than most books on the market these days.I definitely class it as a good value, especially at the price."
positive,"What a great toy!!: I bought this for my son when he was nearing 6 months old. It was great for tummy or back time, since whenever he would poke or kick it he was rewarded with music and lights and swimming glittery fish. He would lie on his back and bonk the flutterballs together or wave them in the air to make the fish inside spin. When he started sitting, he loved to take the balls out and roll them around. He is now 10 months old. He still loves the toy. He takes the balls out, puts them back in, takes them out again and tosses them. He played with it even when the batteries wore out. Now he looks inside to see where the music is coming from. He turns the whole bowl upside down and whacks the bottom. It's been very durable and a lot of fun. The dual volumes are very nice, as is the on/off switch. The fish do occasionally get stuck, but nothing that a good whack hasn't been able to solve. Two thumbs up."
positive,"Enthralling: I'm very glad to have discovered this original, complicated but enthralling book by Kim Newman. In this take-off of Bram Stokers Dracula, the Count survived execution and went on to become the consort of Queen Victoria in 1888. England is made up of the ""un-dead"" and the ""warm,"" and when a killer 'Silver Knife' begins murdering vampire prostitutes, they must work together to track him down. Many names from the original Dracula, as well as other literary works find this way into the story, which is fun.I had a little trouble sticking with this book at first--it is quite complex and with many characters--but once I got pulled in, I could not put the book down. I highly recommend this for fans of the original Dracula."
negative,"Suck it Michael Bay: Boobies, explosions, and maybe the fight/transformation scenes would have been awesome with theater version basss/surround sound. A waste of time. Unless you're drunk. Then it's ok."
positive,"I'm a Garbage addict.... and this rocks!: This is the best CD I've ever heard! Once again, Shirley rocks on with those dark tunes. But this seemed a little happier-especially ""When I grow Up"" and ""Special""-than the first album. Probably the best song is, well, all of them are great! This is certainly ""Special""!"
positive,great: fast delivery and great conditions would defenetly recommend to guy from themand will defently buy from them again
positive,my favorite childhood movie: I was about 6 years old when the last unicorn was in theaters i own they didnt get to see it theater but because i keep telling my parents wanted to see it they rent it for my sister and i we both loved it now that older i wanted this video so my sister and could share with my 4 year old niece needless to say she love the and enyjoys as much as we did(and still do)
positive,"Finally becoming as important as it should've since 1977: I read it first before studying industrial design. Then read bits of it every semester of study. Now, a professional, I was thrilled when I found the new edition. I've always thought the world needs to work more like Papanek proposes, and actually, I think now people are becoming a lot more aware of the issues raised here. Papanek's predictions or ideals are happening: In ecology, social work, and ethics. I admire this author, and it's all because of this book, to start with."
negative,Dissapointing: I bought this as a present for my brother and it turned out to be a great disappointment. The footbag is smaller than a golf ball and there is barely any sand in it.
negative,"No idea what the author is talking about: I have no idea what the author is talking about - it's just the way the book is written. It seems to just start from nowhere. It's either the author is assuming the reader already knows a huge amount about marketing planning or just seems to put down thoughts as they come to mind. I reached Chapter 7 (with skipping some material in between) but can go no further. I read a lot books on management and marketing - this book has just confounded me. Luckily I got it from the library and didn't buy it. I just finished reading one excellent bookThe New Rules of Marketing and PR: How to Use Social Media, Blogs, News Releases, Online Video, and Viral Marketing to Reach Buyers Directly, 2nd Edition& this book was quite a let down after that."
positive,"Have a Heart: If you don't like this movie, you have no heart. Ashley Judd is simply adorable. If you can't accept the fact that meeting the right person is all about timing, you know nothing about life."
negative,"Buy the Porta Booth Pro Not This: Not worth the money. You can buy the Porta Booth Pro for around the same price and get much better results. In fact, after putting in a new vocal booth, I'm so impressed with the Porta Booth Pro, I'm keeping it. I am, however, selling the SE Flexion Filter. Waste of money - waste of space. It just looks cool."
negative,"Great value for the money: This product was purchased as a gift, and it was definitely a value for the money."
positive,Fundamentals of Management: I am very pleased. I received the item in a timely fashion and in good condition.
positive,Works Great!: I love these shirts! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable. Looking forward to buying more of them in the future.
positive,"Works great so far!: I bought this item after the folks at Radio Shack told me there was no way to use a TiVo without a phone line. Once I got it setup with my wireless network, it's been great. Doesn't need internet access very often, but it is definitely much faster than with a phone line (setup took about half the time, if not less). I've had it now for over a month and have had no problems. We'll see how well it lasts."
negative,fragile.. fragile....very fragile...: I've had 6 of them for 1 month and one of them got lips chiped out already. (which one of the reviewer already commented that it happens often with these mug). It was sadly tossed out and now I'm worried they will eventually all dissapear out of my kitchen.Keep them apart from each other when you wash them. The slightest touch will chip it out unexpectedly.BTW: You can buy them individually at Bed and Bath Beyond for less price.
negative,"surprising inaccuracies: An interesting concept containing a series of stumbling blocks that impede the reader's progress down the Brokaw path. Examples: In dealing with both the Womens Army Corps (WAC) and the United States Army Air Corps, Brokaw consistently mis-names the units. The Army Air Corps was NOT the Army Air Force. The WAC began with the WAAC - Womens Army Auxillary Corps- which converted (with the necessity of WAAC members being sworn into the Army), and became the Womens Army Corps. Brokaw consistently and incorrectly refers to it as the WACs -both in the text and in the index on page 412 of the book. I also wondered how the editor had managed to ignore the structure of a sentence on page 190... ""Lieutenent Settle spent the rest of the war supervising medical technicians at the hospital with no difficulties."" My flow of reading was too often impeded by technical error."
positive,"would be 4.6 out of 5: For a cheap bow case, it really lives up to its name. I've traveled a few times to test it out and no problems what so ever! You get what u paid for.I have a mission craze bow and it fits well. There's room for everything i need to put in it!Cons and Problems-A little flimsy and doesn't seem too sturdy. And you have to put in the arrow holders when they should be able to put that together at the factory.Pros-Easy to take, compact, lightweight, holds arrows, holds everything you need, big enough, not too small, good foam padding.OVERALL it's a really nice case especially for the money. i would buy this case 1,000,000 times again. everything is great. the only not so good thing is the construction. it's nice. don't get me wrong. but it's a little flimsy."
positive,"Delightfully Wonderful!!: The Bis members, roughly 19 then, are full of life and hurrah in this full-length studio album! The New Transistor Heroes take indie pop to a whole new level. This is a definent buy. Don't you dare hesitate!"
positive,"A Must Have: My grandson has been enthralled with this since he was a newborn. If he would start to fuss, my daughter would push the button for the music and back off to sleep he would go. Even now, at five months, if he wakes up in the middle of the night, she just pushes the button to turn on the music and lights, and he goes right back to sleep. She call it her ""Miracle Toy""! I loved it so much I got him the swing and boucer, which he likes just as much."
positive,"classical: I really enjoyed This side of the sky, Myraleen and Lorian both childhood friends growing up into fine woman with respect and morals, one of my book club membors recommended this book since I'm avid reader for historical fiction. great job"
positive,"All time favorite movie: I've owned this film for years, first in VHS, then DVD as soon as it was available. It is quite witty, at times hilarious (the reaction to cousins Seton and Laura Cram arrival in the playroom is priceless!) then melancholic, then uplifting. Plenty of fun too, with Grant & Hepburn showing off their athleticism with acrobatic flair. Many different characters and some unusual messages for a 30's film, with a cast of pros and great Cukor direction. Hepburn and Grant cannot be beat, Lew Ayres is just great, but for me the best of the bunch are Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon. A true classic that can be enjoyed time and time again!"
positive,Epic fun.: This has been an amazing experience to play and has a great chance to be one of the best Gamecube games I have played ever. One of the best games ever too. Definitely pick it up as it has lots of everything you can ask for. Definitely up there with FE7 as the best of the series.
positive,"Nice features, but you get what you pay for: I liked the power rating and that it will turn on passively with an analog input (such as the stereo out from a flat screen TV). Shipment was lightening fast and packaging was top notch.Amazon has(d) it on sale for 80 bucks, so jumped on it. While the sound is tolerable it doesn't fit in with the quality of the rest of the system. So this will be relegated to anotherroom and I'll go for the Crown Amp like I should have in the first place."
negative,"Just plain awful!: I love satirical movies, spoofs, slapstick, etc. I love everything that this movie SHOULD have been. The jokes are lame and recycled from other movies. I maybe got 2 good laughs and a few chuckles out of this movie. I never even made it to the end of this movie. I just couldn't stand it anymore and I didn't want to waste any more of my time. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
positive,"Breakout!: That song alone describes what this album, and more specifically the songs She Don't Know Me & Runaway, did for the career of this band. If you listen to this CD, you will recognize a format that they have used on many subsequent albums. On the song Shot Through The Heart (which is my fav on this one), those are the same words you hear Jon sing at the beginning of You Give Love A Bad Name from the ""Slippery"" CD. It's amazing to hear how well played and written this first CD is. Especially given that Runaway & She Don't Know Me were demos done at his uncles club (which I believe were redone when the band formed). An Amazing start to what has been an amazing career. Rock On!"
negative,"Kindle edition full of errors: I purchased the kindle edition of this book a few days ago and have been disappointed to find it full of typos, misspellings and wrong words that frequently change the meaning of a sentence so that I have to read it several times figuring out what the error is. This edition even has the name of Ayla's son Durc wrong, printing it as ""Dure."" This is not the quality I have come to expect from the kindle editions of books."
positive,"A Little Afraid of God's Power? Max wants you to relax.: This book will give you an understanding of why God's message is delivered as it is, to get our attention. Max provides some wonderful stories from John to broaden our understanding of why God communicates the way he does."
positive,"I learned the hard way: I originally bout a netgear adapter because it was a little cheaper than the Tivo adapter. I had nothing but problems with the netgear. Poor signal strength (33% or less) and frequent lost connections (a few times per week on avg). I put up with it for about a year or so before deciding to try the Tivo adapter. I read some good reviews, but was still skeptical. Not any more. It worked great right out of the box, much stronger signal (90%) and after nearly one month, it hasn't lost it's network connection even once! This was definitely the way to go."
negative,"Get over it...: Geez...Get over it people. What is most offensive about this piece of trash if not the rape footage, but rather its ability to manipulate us into thinking this is important in any way. It is badly done, strictly manipulative and in no way worthy of discussion (see, I am being ironic). If you want to witness the true horror of rape, see Kubrick's 'Clockwork' or 'Better Days'. C'mon--kitsch is kitsch and trash is trash and this definitely falls in the latter category. This is offensive not because of its IQ-reducing and blatantly ludicrous aesthetic, but because it is still in the repetoire of horror films(??!!) And the little critique from Cannes speaks volumes to the paucity of good films and postmodern French sensibilities in reviewing films. Let this piece of crap die on the slaughterbench of history--please!!"
negative,Not at all what I expected: Color cover leads one to believe this a quality booklet...Wrong...it is type writer printed pages that should be made available on the internet for FREE. Very dispointed and very misleading.
positive,A very pleasant read: This is the perfect book for a quiet interlude on the couch. You will enjoy it from beginning to end
positive,seabiscuit: i just love seabiscuits story and the impact this animal had on the whole country-fighting for the underdog in a depressed era
negative,"Disappointed: After starting to read the first of many stories in this book. I closed it and didn't read the rest. I do not like fiction because fiction is a story made up in someone else's head. I thought these would be true stories. So if you like fiction, you will like this book. If you want true cat stories, which I prefer, this is not for you. It's my own fault being disappointed in this book merely because it is fiction. I guess it's a good book, again, if you like fiction."
negative,"Fact or Fiction: Have found significant portions of book embelished to point of fiction. Real story was good without the self serving embelishment. Brinkley missed a great opportunity to tell true story, makes John Kerry big target for those of ill will who know real story. Brinkley ghost writer not historian with this book."
positive,"Remembering old times: The music is just as I remember it! It brings back so many memories... The only disappointment, is that is not 100% digital, it has been recorded from a long play, and you can still hear the needle going on the disc. Besides that is perfect!"
positive,"Wonderful and Emotional: I enjoyed this book and was recommended the book by the author. I cried with Nina, Ahmad and Ebony. The characters were believeable and made me look deep within myself. I enjoyed the relationship of father and daughter in Ahmad and Ebony and Nina and Mitchell.Job Well Done"
positive,Alls well that ends well: This is a perfect story of everything working out in the end. Im getting married and so decided to watch all the wedding movies I could find this didn't disappoint at all. It was great to watch a non-american film gives you an eye into other cultures.
positive,"My daughter's favorite book - a lot of fun!: I bought this book from Amazon sight unseen because my 4 year old is now a big sister. I was very pleasantly surprised with the clever design, humor, and fun colorful illustrations drawn by 'Dilly'. It is really aimed at older children (maybe 7-11), especially the humor which is right on for that age. It is great for younger kids too if you don't mind your 4 year picking up expressions like 'gross me out' and 'punky' (which are now common expressions in our house). My daughter is an early reader and this book motivates her to read independently or at least pore over the pictures a lot. I look forward to the sequel re. Dilly's camping experiences."
positive,Great product: Finally I found bike rack that fit for my car 1995 Toyota Celica. This mount rack goes over the spoiler. It's very sturdy to carry my two mountain bikes.
negative,I don't: This movie was horrid. He only wanted to marry because he thought he had to. And he was going get some money. Save your money this movie suck.
positive,"Dude, it's a lama: No dude, it's an ostrich. While this movie vears off into strange territory and may not be exactly what one would expect from the trailors, it definitely has some laugh-out-loud moments. I think you definitely need to be in the right age-group to enjoy this flick, it's definitely not for anyone who's mature or doesn't remember having to struggle to find a car after a night out."
positive,"not as brilliant as some make it out to be: OK first thing's first, I love the beta band. Secondly, they're a typical prog band. If you can imagine Stone Roses inviting Kraftwerk for an acoustic jam session (NOT an album recording though) you may get some idea of what this album is about.Standout tracks for ANYONE are Dry The Rain (of course), Inner Meet Me, She's the One, and Needles in my Eyes. Some of the other songs on the album are just too average and boring but good as background music when you're busy doing something.In some ways, the third album is more complete and much more accessible."
positive,"All-Star Lineup: This is a very good recording of a fabulous concert. The sound and picture are first rate and the list of performers is, simply, a stunning collection of British rockers. McCartney singing ""Golden Slumbers"" is alone worth the purchase price. I highly recommend it."
negative,"A Little Disappointing: I loved all of Sophie Kinsella's books. This book is definitely not as good as the Shopaholic Series. The characters aren't really well-defined, the plot meanders at the end. You can avoid this book and not miss much."
positive,"Adorable advent calendar!: I collect advent calendars, and am always looking for interesting ones that aren't just the run of the mill--this calendar is darling. The bunny families are beautifully drawn, and each door that is opened continues the scene in some way, actually telling a little story each time a door is opened. It is charming."
negative,"So the mummy returns?...did we need him to?: I enjoyed THE MUMMY, but before going to see this one I somehow knew it wasn't going to be good. Well, I was right. If you are looking for a movie that will showcase the latest in CGI technology, by all means see it. Just don't look for interesting characters or a good story. The first movie was good. It was one of those movies that in the future if it's on during a lazy Sunday, you will watch it. It had that quality about it. The sequel left me wishing for it be over as I sat in the theater.The story becomes borderline ridiculous and the acting, well, they knew their lines at least. It follows a formula. For example, in the first one we had the crazy biplane pilot, now we have a crazy blimp pilot. It seems to me that the legacy of Ancient Egypt could help a writer create some more interesting aspects to this movie. Well, I was wrong."
positive,"This movie grew on me.: After first watching this movie years ago I thought just another John Wayne ""B"" movie. The more I watched it, the more I realize it was a very good story and very well acted."
positive,"Exactly What Was Needed: This is not the first messenger bag my teenager has had but it is the best. The size is perfect for books, papers and stuff. The materials are very durable without being stiff. And it looks really cool!"
negative,"Do Not Waste Your Money: This item broke in the first day we received it. The clear plastic ""cup"" that holds pencil shavings broke off from the back, this was after we only shapened about 5-6 pencils.Very disappointed. Amazon is great though and we rec'd a refund. Thanks Amazon."
negative,"Not quite the quality I have had in the past: I was really happy to find jersey knit sheets at Amazon and couldn't wait to receive them as my old set had worn out. Finding them at an incredible price, I ordered two sets! However, the quality of these jersey sheets were not the excellent quality I had bought several years ago at a wholesale warehouse. We are using them on our queen size bed, and love the feel of the soft jersey, but they do not retain their shape after you toss and turn on them a few times. I don't know how they will respond after they are washed again, but I do miss the heavier knit of my old worn out sheets."
negative,"A mere shadow of the magnificence that was Dune.: Unfortuantly, Dune Messiah does not live up to Dune. Dune I gave five stars, however, this book does not go in depth about anything. It merely skimms the top of everything and doesn't explain or explore as well as it could have, and should have.Dune Messiah attempts to build on Dune, the ultimate in sci-fi, and fails miserably. Instead of bettering the Dune story, it weakens it with bad plot twists that are nothing like that of Dune.I had trouble reading the end of this book because it starts out slow, and doesn't improve. It laggs through the whole story whereas Dune the origional glued you to the book.Finally, Messiah mocks the origional Dune by weakenning the structure with which Dune was created and the glory was origionally born.So if you're looking to find the magic that Dune brought, don't read Massiha, it just doesn't live up to the name Dune."
positive,"great for all ages = helps mind keep sharp=: Purchased as gift for self / took it to work and got co-workers addicted to it- VERY ADDICTIVE ITEM= great mind activiity for all ages -even good for alzheimer - any good mind game help wardalzheimer's - easy to carry around! Batteries can be changed, does take some rough useage but if dropped enough or the wrong way can crack case or damage the viewing window that you read for it's questions it asks you..can be VERY TRICKY TOO! A DELIGHTFUL EDUCATION ITEM. Can't really call it a toy, much more than that--I had to buy 15 of them to pass around & use as gifts!!"
positive,"It did what it said, it said what it did.: This movie is a fusion, a cinematic expression of violent sexual acts and justifyable homicide. While the hairstyles, and even the haircuts ;} forever date the film as a 70's drive in sexploitation flick, there is enough wrong going around in this picture to wind the broken clock of even the most ardent gorehound or woman's prison movie aficiondo. It just begs for a remake, but of course that will never happen until society collapses entirely. Here's hoping! I just wish the main character didn't look like she had Buckwheat in a scissorlock for the duration of the rougher scenes."
negative,"stop smoking and get to work: I am a huge Sedaris fan but was very disappointed in this book. First off, as a fan, I had already read half the stories put together here in magazines. Secondly, they just aren't as funny as his earlier works. Sedaris needs to broaden his horizons or if he insists on sticking to the same subjects over and over, work harder to make the stories funny. It's sad when you see great writers getting lazy."
negative,"Horrified, and not in a good way: To echo the sentiments of other reviewers, the orginal macabre illustrations were what made these books!, My highschool age son can't recall any of the stories but still talks about the ""super creepy"" pictures. Political correctness run amuck is the only explaination for the watering down of the imagery into something bland and banal. I truly hope the publisher reads these reviews if only to realize what a ridiculous decision changing the artwork was."
negative,To small: I was using swaddlers (pampers yellow box) and then decided to try these baby-dry (pampers green box. My 5 month old is in a size 2 but when I ordered size 2 in the baby-dry they were to small even though she was still in the weight range (15lbs) they give on the box. So my advise is that the baby-dry pampers run small.
negative,"Irwin Utility Knife: The fixed unit is ok, but a folding utility knife is better. The sliding unit is junk. The blade does not stay in the knife. Easy to change the blade, but who cares if the blade won't stay put."
positive,"Read this one it is great!!: I read a lot and was looking for something a little different when I picked this up at the bookstore. I do not usually read historical fiction. But I thought I should try something different and I am so glad I did. This book is well written and the characters are developed very well. I began to identify with the Characters and became very involved in the story. It is true that historically it may not be the most acurate but to those who are so critical of that let me remind you this is FICTION. YOu may want to try something nonficiton or biographical if you are looking for straight history.This book is a big book and may seem intimidating but it is not, I found it to be an easy read and I found myself up late at night trying to finish it. When I did finish it I was sorry it was over but so glad I had read it. I am now a huge Philippa Gregory fan and have already started another Of her books ""Wildacre""."
negative,"Its a Cheap MP3 Player thats it: Its just a durable product with great sound quality, but don't expect anything more from it. The ear phones are too big for my years and the device is not easy to use. You will need to use a software to convert your videos to be compatible with this device. The only good thing is that you don't need any software to load songs in to this player, however, the folders that you have on your hard disk will not appear on the player. This is what I don't like. I would like to have a player which will let me create my own music folders and not create the default ones. I disliked iPod because of iTunes, but now I feel iPod is much better than this even though iTunes is not so easy to use, its at least easier than running this device. No wonder, the product is priced so cheap."
negative,"Disappointing quality: While this game is fun to play, and my children enjoy the secret door aspect of the game, the quality of the product is really, really poor. The board itself arrived warped and buckled with the house glued on it crookedly. At least half the playing pieces tore as we took them apart. Definitely not built to last."
positive,"Wonderful story: I am not going to summarize the book, that has been done enough, I don't normally do that in my reviews.......anyway, I really enjoyed this book. I was surprised at all the mixed reviews I read on Amazon as well as some papers and magazines. I thought this was one of Mr. Grisham's best. I have to admit, for you skeptics out there, I have always been a fan of Mr. Grisham's, but I have felt his last few books have not lived up to my expectations. I think this one is WONDERFUL. I think Mr. Grisham is just a great storyteller, and this was one great story. The charcters were believable and interesting, and the story itself grabbed my interest and would not let go. I for one am thrilled to have a Grisham book that rates up there with A Time to Kill, The Firm,and Pelican Brief. This book will join my stack of Grisham's that I like to reread, just for the enjoyment of a good story."
positive,"Realistic and Great Fun!: Russ is a charming little boy who happens to have Down Syndrome. This tale, told in photos and text, tells about his day with Mom, Dad, Grandma and Grandpa. The story works beautifully and Down Syndrome is never mentioned. Russ is just a little boy who happens to have Down Syndrome! Jane Rickert has written a simple, darling book about her own son and has let us know that he is just an ordinary boy who likes apple trees and surprises. Ms. Rickert read her story to children at an Inclusive Childcare Canter near her home. The children loved it and they still make it one of their favorites. It is read over and over again - the sure sign of a hit with the kids. This book points out the sameness between children, not the differences and that is incredibly important. I highly recommend this book for any child regardless of ability/disability."
positive,"The Rationale For Righteousness: If 'because the Bible says so!' is not enough of a motivation for you then Mere Christianity is the book for you.Mere Christianity proposes a reasonable and rational argument on behalf ofBiblical principles. Lewis' grasp of morality and human nature support the sovereignty of Godly ideals by showing how they apply outside of a purely Christian context into everyones everyday life and character.If you wish to understand the nature of goodness and the many 'whys' behind it Lewis pieces answers together with supreme simplicity, reason and logic. It will equip you to defend the Gospel, deepen your understanding of morality and familiarize you with Jesus teachings without the fire-breathing rhetoric of dogma.Get it!"
positive,Workout CD: I don't really remember what's on this one. I purchased to install in my MP3 for walking/jogging and it's fine
positive,"fascinating and reassuring: Orr's book is a fantastic illustration of the current state of the world in terms of the relationship between technology, ecology, design and economy from a theoretical-philosophical perspective. He does not brush anything ""under the carpet"" and provides a very broad and deep understanding of our incompetence as a society saturated with consumption to deal with the consequences of our modern way of life. The best thing about this book, in comparison with other books in the subject, is first of all that it provides a highly engaging read, and second of all that it offers a very clear solution to our social and environmental problems - to live within and according to nature's limits. Orr's argument is convincing, not only because it is supported by many beautiful references, but mainly because it provides a very practical and honest pathway to the future."
positive,"LATE BREAKING NEWS! THERE ARE TO BE 4 BOOKS IN THE SERIES!: And then there were four. Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Trilogy, the first two volumes of which have sold 12.5 million copies worldwide, has officially become a ""cycle,"" with Knopf's announcement this morning that there will be a fourth novel. The third book, which is still untitled, will pub on September 23, 2008 in a national laydown. A pub date and title for the fourth book have not been named.I am THRILLED!!!! But NOT surprised. I felt that there were waaaaaay too many loose ends to tie up in just one more book. Anyone else out there feel the same way?Pamela Driehorstkickbuttbooks.com"
positive,"rare concert, awesome audio: I recently watched this at a friend's house. He has an excellent surround sound setup and this DVD has DTS. amazing.as a habit I don't like live concert video - rarely buy them.the guest artists are phenomenal - Paul McCartney at the end is lots of fun/great songs.How many times are you going to see Clapton and Knopfler playing together, filmed well and in DTS?you just can't go wrong with this DVD."
negative,"I couldn't get into this one: This movie didn't do anything for me. I thought the acting was 'wooden' and the plot simplistic. I do enjoy action movies, but this one didn't fit into that category imho. I did like a few of the fight scenes, but they weren't enought to win me over."
negative,"This is science?: Psychobabble. For Ms Fisher's theories to have any validity, human brains would have to be hard wired like salamanders. ALL men thinking one way and ALL women thinking another. All human beings are individuals with individual talents and abilities.The idea that women have unique talents in verbal expression flies in the face of history. How would Helen Fisher explain Shakespear, Dostoyevsky, James Joyce, or thousands of other male communicaters? And where IS this evidence of superior female abilities at communication? They don't exist. If there are differences between the male and female brains, it is a difference in style and nuance, not the determanist gulf that she postulates. Every one of her points can be easily be refuted through common experience. Helen Fisher's book is radical feminist agit-prop in the guise of scientific analysis."
positive,"Kung Fu At It's Best: If you love kung fu or action flicks pick up Mortal Kombat. This movie rocks! I was a little disappointed that the film was in PG-13 and not rate R, mainly because the MK franchise was all about the insense blood and gore. But, When I fist saw this movie in theaters it blew me away, the acting was good but the kung fu fightin' was better. The charaters in the film are all cool, I like Raiden (or is it Rayden?) the best along with Scorpion. The second film New Line produced wasnt as great as the original but still had its moments. Rumors of a third film being produce! If its true, I can't wait until its released!If you haven't seen the oringial Kombat, check it out. Hey everyone likes kung ku fightin..FINISH HIM!"
positive,"4 years and still a favorite!!: My 8 1/2 year old daughter got this four years ago for Christmas and I can honestly say it has been one of our most used toys! It has been set up all over the house and outside too. Up until last year she would still have sleepovers in it (It's getting a little small for her for that now). But it is still taken out and set up quite often. I usually set it up myself (I am 5'tall, and less than 100 lbs. and it is extremely easy and simple for me to do.) Unlike the previous reviewer, we have never had problems with tearing, it has been amazingly durable. I have an 18 month old now, and he is also loving it. I use just the tunnel with him sometimes, too! We love it so much I am getting one for my two nieces this Christmas. This is one toy you will get a lot of miles out of!!"
positive,Female Hose Coupling 01FZ: Shipped fast and arrived in good condition. I used this to replace a plastic repair coupling that I had installed a year ago. This should hold up much better than the plastic. The clamp is zinc and the rest is brass. Nice quality and it went together quickly and easily.
negative,"Truth or fiction?: Mr. Hillerman should at least get the facts straight in his author's note! Officer Dale Claxton was murdered on May 29, 1998 not May 4. Disjointed and poorly proofread, this novel is at least a short one. I find it unfortunate that Mr. Hillerman uses the tragic incident in Cortez as the basis for a diatribe against the FBI."
positive,puppycat: this a book that you can't keep your nose out of it holds at so much suspence and is one of the best books i have ever read you have to read it !
negative,"Not Very Good: Well, I waited for this album for quite a few years and I must admit I feel let down. ""Bringing Down the Horse"" was so utterly perfect and wonderful and I expected this album to be just as good. However, the songwriting is so bad on this album that I felt the money I had spent to purchase it had been wasted. I mean, what the heck was up with ""Murder 101""? It sounds like garage music written by a 12-year-old. I gave the album 2 stars because at least the performance style is polished and the vocals are pretty good."
negative,"pretty much nothing happens...: watched this movie when i was a kid and fairly enjoyed it. the theme was novel when i was 11. at 33, however, i consider Quiet Earth to have the substance and sustenance of cheeze wiz and crackers.there's no meat to the story, no real character development, and the whole movie feels like a trivial bore. occasionally, stuff will almost happen, but then it doesn't and the audience is left with a deserted planet kind of nihilism.D"
positive,"My first 100% plastic cards and they are great: I have the guys over for Poker once a month and these were a big hit. These are my first 100% plastic cards. I have used the cheap ones from the dollar store, better plastic coated, and used casino cards. These are far better then any of those. They feel good when shuffling, no sticking, and just feel right when playing. They seem very sturdy and it is hard to bend the corners but not impossible. I bought them for the durability so only time will tell if they hold up.I did the research and these ranked as high as any of the other brands. The price was right and I have no regrets.FYI: These came in a cardboard box with a pastic insert and are 'regular index' which is 2-pip design. I have seen reviews on other sites for old tropy which said they were 4-pip. I just mention this because I wanted to try the 4-pip design."
positive,"My favorite bra in the world!: I got professionally fitted and the associate brought this to me. Originally I wasn't planning to spend so much on a bra, but it looked so beautiful both in and out of clothes that I just had to have it. Now that I know my perfect size I stock up from Amazon.This bra gives excellent support. The shape goes more forward, instead of either pressing together or going sideways. I noticed that my figure looked much better, and I looked slimmer with the great lift. It's very sheer, and a bit lacy so it's not for t-shirts, but other than that it is my go-to style. I love the plunge neckline so it doesn't show under my v-necks. I always love pink and black. It's so sexy and flattering, and my husband loves it. Worth every penny!"
positive,"Must HAVE!: This CD is on my top 5 list, In fact.. Probably the 1st! MEST has talent! I hope to see them get big some day! This band rocks! Other bands that you'd probably like is Blink 182, Simple Plan, and Saves The Day."
negative,"fraud or just gobbletygook: This book is full of misunderstandings of basic physics and even arithmetic. It is either fraud or just utterly stupid. There are many fairly good pictures of ice crystals, and the basic messages, e.g. ""The world is linked together by love and gratitude"" are nice and can provoke thought.Some reviewers defend this book saying things like ""it isn't meant to be scientifically rigorous"" or ""it isn't a science journal"" or even ""It just dosn't seem like valid science to people who lack the author's brilliant insight."" But, the main thrust of the book is an attempt to provide a foundation for thoughts about love and water through what is purported as experimental results and valid scientific theory. The ""facts"" are not accurate, are misunderstood, or just make no sense. There seems to be a longing among many readers for scientific validation of spiritual ideas, but I think it is a disservice to take advantage of their gullibility and ignorance, as this book does."
positive,Great speakers for the price: I was pleasantly surprised how good these speakers were for the price. I had to replace my original speakers but did not want to spend a lot of money. For $20 I was glad I did not get sucked into the more money means better quality because these do the job. I have the sub on the floor and the 2 little speakers on each side of the monitor and it sounds great. Buy them and keep some extra money in your wallet.
positive,Shoes: I love shoes...I couldnt wait to get these...I had them in a few days and their great. I even got a pair for my son. I recomend the shoes and Amazon!!
negative,"I've read worse: I've certainly read worse stories, but the sheer amount of typos and grammatical mistakes and misuse of words alone turned me off to this book. I was barely a chapter in before I had a pencil in hand and was becoming more and more preoccupied with the mistakes than the plot. Shouldn't an editor have caught these? That alone was painful, and not to mention the dialogue and the awkward sentences themselves. I had hoped that this child ""prodigy"" book would actually be good, not a book that sounded like something I had written when I was fifteen."
positive,"90 percents: its nice, but i just have little disapointed about its volume( its not high enough) Actually it's fine"
positive,Excellent product: I would highly recommend this product as it saved me from purchasing a new hose. Its constructed from high quality materials and works well@@
positive,"Premise: murder and racism in a small town: Though I agree the writing at times was a little elementary, the story was disturbing to me, not just because of the theme of child molestation/murder but also because of the racism aspect. I am a non-white person living in a small community in the Northwest (about 2 hours from Seattle) with very little crime. While I have never experienced blatant racism, I have encountered some innocent/ignorant comments from people who were not hatefull; I'm assuming they were just not very culturally aware, so I can relate to many of the situations/feelings in the book. This is not a story with a happy ending; rather, it was sad (police chief and detective's relationship) as well as disturbing (altering crime evidence, guilt by association, hidden racial and militia agendas). It would seem to be a book to spark discussion groups on these multiple themes. I will read the author's first novel."
negative,"disappointing: The information provided in this book is so basic as to be almost useless for anyone except perhaps those with absolutely no knowledge about the whippet or dogs. However, the quality of the writing is so poor that I really can't recommend it even to those looking for the most elementary guide. At times I was so distracted by the grammar, structure etc that I couldn't absorb the little information that was provided. It's certainly not what I would call a 'manual'. Gorgeous cover picture and lovely shiny paper but value for money, no."
positive,Great Start to ASP: ASP for Dummies was the first computer book I ever read cover to cover. I learned to do use ASP efectively with this book in less than a week!The exapmple code in the book is well written and easily portable.This book was so cool that it forced me to buy weebspace on a decent server so that I could share my ASP Pages with the world in less than a month.
positive,"Love it or hate it...: Everyone I encounter who knows who Bjork is either loves or hates her work...doesn't seem to be any middle ground. If you like only traditional pop, country or other genres and want all the songs on your albums to sound the same, stay away from Bjork.If, on the other hand, you get tired of songs that all sound the same and are looking for something fresh, you'll love Bjork. It seems she is trying something specifically unique on each track.I find 'Post' slightly more innovative and interesting than 'Debut', although both CDs are great. Of this bunch, my favs are, in order: Possibly Maybe, Isobel, Army of Me, Cover Me, Hyper Ballad and Enjoy, so the Amazon provided clips cover only half the good ones! The only track I didn't care for is It's Oh So Quiet.Get it and listen to someone who isn't afraid to experiment!"
negative,"waste of time: continuity was not there, story line was unknown. so unrealistic, non continuous, special effect show that even that was no good."
positive,"Found at last: My husband's favourite single was given to him by a friend more than 40 years ago. It was a Memorable Session volume 5 featuring Lionel Hampton and his Paris All Stars with the titles Always and Real Crazy. We still have it, but is no longer in a state to play on the record player since it is literally worn out. We have been looking for a replacement on an LP or CD for ages. Recently I discovered Amazon.com and to our surprise I fount out when I was browsing that the original recordings are newly released. We received it today and and played it immediately. The sound quality of the remastered titles is superb and not only my husband's favourites were on it, but also other titles, of which we did not know the existence. To us all the titles are anything but outdated and I am sure that we will play the CD time and time again especially at parties. The music is really infatuating and makes you feel like dancing."
negative,"First two arrived damaged, waiting for number 3: Two chargers arrived with major dents on the bottom (see pictures I posted). Schumacher ships them without adequate protective packaging. It may be a good charger if you can get an undamaged unit. I'm waiting for the third one now.Update: Third charger arrived without dents and was packed the same way as the first two. The housing is made of thinner metal than the 20+ year old Schumacher that died last month. I did raise the rating from 1 star to 2 stars since I ended up with a good unit after three tries and it works well (big star reduction since it took THREE trys!)."
positive,"Great realism and entertainment: Even though i have no connection with the american historical culture of the sea i find a large interest in history and i believe this story is a true treasure for a lover of history and any story that grabs you and pulls you in! This certainly did it for me. I didn't realise it was such a famous story, and no wonder why. The strength and hope these men had is truly remarkable! There will to live in such dire straights is much to be admired. It delves into the highest of joyous accomplishments to the lowest of human depravity and desperations. Very recommended!"
positive,"Extremely interesting and exciting! A real QUEST!: Perhaps, this video is the best film (or gift) for those who like playing computer games and, particularly, computer quests. Visual effects and decor are so real that you can forget you are at home in your favourite armchair. Acting is perfect (and casting is well thought-out); music is very nice - the whole video demonstrates it is an organic whole. A very good job of professionals in every field. And I don't agree with those who think it is too slow - otherwise, you wouldn't be ready to understand and feel the idea and course of action. It is not an ordinary scary movie or thriller - definitely, it is more... Try it and I think you won't be disappointed at all."
positive,"Good First Effort: While I cannot say I absolutely love every song on this CD (because a couple of them sound similar) and would ideally rate it 3.5 stars, I can say it's got a few very good tunes on it, which makes it worth buying. ""Invisible"" is easy to listen to, and the title cut, ""Measure of a Man,"" is one of the CD's strongest efforts and my personal favorite. If you never got around to buying his Idol single ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" w/ ""This is The Night,"" they're included here and are an added bonus. Basically enjoyable and a must for any fan of Clay!"
positive,"Brilliant: Steinbeck's book Of Mice and Men is one of the most incredible works of American literature. It's a story about how two men try to achieve some semblance of success in Depression-era California. However, all of their hopes and dreams are shattered by the people around them. This is a must-read."
positive,"Life is absurd: Reading this not too long yet so deep novel, I cannot help but visualize Camus' picture of which he is smoking a cigar with such pensive expression on his face.It may seem, to some people, that Meursault was an absurdly hopeless man who apparently had no emotion whatsoever. But as his attitude, if any, toward life shows it is all a matter of choice. Whichever may have its own value.Just like what existentialism sees in life.The beauty of ascetic life echoes A.Camus words:In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer."
negative,"Good idea, bad broduct: I have owned this for about 4 months and have had to send in 2. On the first, the readout didn't work, then on the second, the charger died after using it once. The readout doesn't work on the third, but I figured what's the use? I tried calling xantrex to see why there are so many problems, but getting their customer service is impossible. When it works, it's great, but doesn't have nearly the operating time that it says. Also, the radio might as well not even be there since the reception is so bad with the battery working. Amazon is great in exchanging this, however, and I give them 5 stars."
positive,"Keeps him entertained in his crib.: We got this gift for my baby shower and put it in our son's crib. At 6 months, he is now rolling over and many times we find him on his stomach, watching the aquarium in his crib. The lights, movement and music keeps him entertained and helps strengthen his neck and arm muscles as he pushes himself up to watch it; and then he reaches over to press the on and off button on his own. We can catch a couple more minutes of sleep while our son plays in his crib, enjoying his aquarium."
positive,"Enjoyable Read: I'm really surprised by the scathing reviews that have been posted here. Some people seem to forget that Julia Child is not the author of this book. This is a book about Julie and the impact Julia had on her life. Read ""My Life in France"" if you only want to know about Julia Child.I'm glad Julie was able to find solace and success in her cooking project while working at a stressful and thankless temp job. I thought this was a great memoir.The movie was a disappointment and didn't give Julie the depth of character that comes through in the novel."
negative,"Uninteresting and over-hyped: I bought this CD on the basis of the rave reviews here. After the first listening, I was bored and couldn't see what the fuss was about. After listening another 3 times, I found the album even less interesting. What I was expecting was the excitement and artistry of, say, the early Streissand albums. Bjork turned out to be a disappointment. Her vocal technique is so-so, and her lyrics are largely insipid. Obviously, many people like her work, but for me(a member of the minority) her music just doesn't do very much. Maybe after listening a few more times, I will finally see the light. But then again, there seem to be a lot of used copies of this album for sale, so maybe listeners are giving up and trying to recoup their lost money."
negative,"skip it: Don't waste your time with Wishville...your time and money is better spent on Ferment and Chrome, and even the B-sides Like Cats and Dogs...and if you can find it, the Show Me Mary single with the tune ""Smother"" on it...amazing."
negative,"This is just a story for another american movie: It would be a good movie, but in reality III World war would be much different. We read books and wach movies to expirience what we want to expirience. In the reald world III world war would last for decades, without the nuclear weapons. And at last there would be no winners."
negative,"needs a better plot and better actors: keep this short and sweet the telly actor is the worst actor in the wrold.I seen bad actors in my life but telly is like some kid you will beatup everyday.And the plot relly sucked,if i made this movie this is what i would have done.Convertation about the hiv,with jenny and telly. telly feels guilty,and kills him shelf for the pain he inflicted on the girls.And could be more than a wake up call to kids for all the pain you put poeple through and your shelf. And if poeple think this his the best movie way because thires a wake up call this movie never chanched me because the plot was relly bad."
positive,"Simply put, Bowie's best, most consistent work since SM(&SC): Bowie incorporates trip-hop, ambient, synth-pop, glam, and a couple other styles into a varied but consistent album. It's not TOO varied to be jumpy though. One song ALWAYS flows into the next eloquently. I have all of bowie's albums, and his ""comeback"" albums (Outside and Earthling) have NOTHING on this. This almost seems as if they extracted the pop songs from underneath the Jungle and Industrial-ish beats and made THIS. Bowie is truly back."
negative,"Don't waste your money.: I was really looking forward to reading this book, but couldn't get more than 50 pages in when I had to stop. I bought this book thinking it was about the ups and downs of trying to follow Julia Childs' French recipes, but it had little of that. It's mainly filled with whining, bad language, and her overall immature views on life. If you want a book on food steer clear of this one."
positive,"Bravo!: Though some of the works here are better than others, such as ""Milagro"", and ""The Integral"", Ms. Pita offers enough of a variety with a master's stroke that most tastes will be satisfied."
negative,"A WASTE OF VIEWING TIME AND MONEY!: THIS IS A BLATANT CASE OF FALSE ADVERTISING THAT I'VE EVER SEEN! I'M EXPECTING TO SEE FLEETWOOD-MAC PERFORMING ALL THE SONGS FROM THEIR ALBUM 'RUMORS' (WHICH IS A GREAT PIECE OF WORK!). INSTEAD, ALL I SEE ARE THE RECORDING TECHNICIANS EXPLAINING HOW THEY MIXED THE VARIOUS SONGS, WHICH, BRINGS ME TO MY MAIN BEEF...ONLY BITS AND PIECES OF THE SONGS ARE PLAYED. NONE OF THE SONGS WERE PLAYED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ALSO, THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE BAND MEMBERS SEEMED TO FOCUS ON WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH WHOM AND WHY THE AFFAIR ENDED. WHO CARES? I WANTED TO SEE F-M PERFORM AND WAS VERRRRRRY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY DIDN'T. AT LEAST I HAVE MEMORIES OF TWO OF THEIR CONCERTS THAT I ATTENDED YEARS AGO."
negative,"NO WAY!!!!!: First this review does not have to do with Pampers quality.... second, I can not believe that Amazon is selling this diapers for this price. Babies r us is much more expensive and they sell this package for 40 bucks. I do like Amazon but some items are extremely expensive.!!!!!! really really bad"
negative,"I should like it but I don't: I would like to think that I am always supportive of Australian talent, but in this case I am not. This book is highly impractical in the main. I mean really, who could devote 7 days to working on a magickal new self. It's a lovely idea, but just so self-centred. The amount of money you would have to spend to fossick around for all the bits and pieces she says you need, urgh you'd need a lie down after that. Ok so she sort of redeems herself at the end with a small section on what to do if you don't have the time, but it's a token chapter.The other thing is that most of the text appears to have been borrowed form her other publications, and the picture on the front, whilst very cutesy, she is a pretty lass after all, is a real-turn off to a serious Wiccan practitioner.Sorry Fiona, not a great buy or unique read."
negative,"Type face and pictures too small: While the illustrations are beautiful, I need a magnifying glass to see them. I had planned to use this book in my Children's Church class but the pictures are too small for a group to see. Even with glasses, I need a magnifyer to read the book."
negative,"Wow.: Wow. Wow. I cannot believe that this has never received less than three stars. Are you guys serious?? A bunch of boys on an island who turn into savages, and then, at the last minute, when the protagonist is about to die, they get rescued?? This is, of course, after waiting the whole book for this to happen. Oh, by the way, kill all the good characters, and make a set of twins into a single person. What a fantastic idea!!I don't quite know what else to say except: really? really?Really? No girls. Really? A talking pig head?? REALLY??To put it simply: this buck sucked."
negative,"really disappointed: though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed. i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results. the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes. still nothing.i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck. i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did"
negative,"Dark and Confusing: I had some problems with this film. It seems pretty implausible to me that six potential models would even take on this expedition. Even if I accept this premise, none of the characters distinguished themselves, so I therefore had no emotional investment in any of them. When they ultimately get to the depths of the cave things just become dark and confusing. By the end of the film I didn't know who was dead or dying and really didn't care.This is a well made film, but it could have been great if they had taken a cue from 'Deliverance' and reduced the amount of characters to four and gotten a well known actress or two."
positive,"A five-star mixed review: This cd would be six stars if possible if all the other tracks but 'Spanish Grease' and 'Fried Neckbones and Some Homefries'. were removed. As it is, it gets a five. Grooves don't get any better than this."
positive,"Going on an adventure!: I read ""The Hobbit"" because I had already read ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and adored it. Therefore, it's hard for me to think of The Hobbit without comparing and contrasting it to the trilogy. First off, The Hobbit bears all of Tolkien's genius: descriptive passages that are more like a painting than a paragraph, clever poetry and songs, and an imaginary world that has come to life with Tolkien's inventive language and culture of the characters. When one reads Tolkien, it's like reading about a real place. However, the one thing that I really did not like about ""The Hobbit,"" especially in comparison to LOTR, is that there is very little character development. I often had trouble keeping track of names because the characters just don't do much besides have adventures. On the whole, I give this book 4 stars for its creativity, originality, adventurous plot, and beautiful language."
negative,"Karaoke....nothing more: If you want to shell out ten bucks for a CD that is no better than the country western karaoke chick at your neighborhood bar, be my guest. That is the extent of this one...I guess the original songwriters are happy to cash the royalty checks from this CD, but they have to be embarassed with the final product. Some songs were perfect the first time...why does Mandy Moore of all people, think she needs to ""cover"" them? If you want to hear Joni, Carole, Carly, etc. in all their glory, buy their CD's. And support your local karaoke singer by dropping a nice tip in jar. But beware of this CD!"
negative,The Longest video lacks focus.: Despite having 48 International stars and winning two Oscars. I found it to be a big let downThe sory of D-day told by both sides jumped around to much.It seems the plot was all sub plots.Rent it Don't buy it. Not a good war picture
positive,K&N All the way: I recently replaced my stock air filter out of my gsxr-750 and this air filter DEFINITELY is worth the money. It is reuseable and washable which is the best part. I recommend buying a cleaner for it if you are going to indeed clean it.
negative,Very Disapointed: I was very disapointed with this mobile. My daughters crib is 1 of the convertible cribs with a bigger head board & we had a really hard time even getting the mobile attached to the crib. The bars in our crib are bigger than the standard & the mobile did not fit well. Even after we got the mobile attached we had to keep playing with the battery box to get the mobile to come on. We ended up returning it for another mobile.
positive,"Awaiting DVD: Saw this great movie again on TCM this week. Now that Bringing Up Baby is finally out on DVD, this one moves to the top of my pining list."
positive,"Informative and productive workout: The information sections have been very helpful. With this DVD you get it all, challenging, but not killer aerobics, strength training and relaxing yoga. Kathy does it again with a very thoughtful, fun, helpful workout. I would highly recommend it for anyone approaching or experiencing menopause."
negative,"no: I was forced to read this book and I still hate my teacher for it. Its about about a man who doesn't care about his mother dying, he doesn't seem to care that he hung around the wrong crowd and killed a man in self defense and he ends up paying for his carelessness. Good for him. I am still angry that I had to read this crap."
negative,"Gnarly: Dear Clay,Well, I know this is a real busy time of year for you since you are an elf and everything, but I just had to write you and give you some praise for the awesome use of the echo-effect on your song ""Invisible"". Nice. Tell Santa I said hi.Sincerely,1984"
negative,"bad dubbing?: The sound quality was AWFUL... if there was any way to return to get a better sound I would, but the content was awesome. It sounds like a bad tape-recording dubbed a million times to the point the voices are low and fuzzy. Oh-well. If you love Therese, like we do, you can bear with it and ""offer it up."""
negative,"Broke after a week: A tooth fell out but could still play it. Then another tooth fell out (can't replace) so made the game even less playable. Also, it was really tiny and more like a travel size which I did not expect for the money."
negative,Yuck: These are directly from China- really. Shipped in a brown envelope no pacifier case no wrapping. Like who would ever put this near a baby? What a sick waste.
positive,N/A: I returned this because I received the same one as a gift. I love the one I got as a gift. I assume this one was a similar quality.
negative,"The Monster Walks: The Mummy (1999) was perhaps the greatest achievement in the Adventure-genre since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), while the sequel suffers quite a lot from the fact, that it was obviously rushed for commercial reasons. It's a great rough draft though and a few sequences are quite brilliant, including the fighting off the warrior-mummies in the London-doubledecker-bus turned singledecker. It's great fun, but nothing at all like the first one."
negative,Not good for watercolor after dry: I purchased this ink thinking it would be perfect for sketching before watercolorwashes. It seems to lay on top of the paper and runs after drying it for a day. It's a bit glorpy in consistency. I'm not seeing all the great things people havesaid about this ink.
positive,"The Wealth of Nations: Of course this is a classic, and hardly needs my recommendation. My only reason for limiting it to four stars is that it is a difficult read. Smith, an 18th century Scott, doesn't write the English that we speak today. He is extremely detailed, and one must remember he is writing of the English economy of three centuries ago. Some of the analysis is anachronistic, but most remains true to this day."
positive,"FULL VOLUME, FULL POWER TRIP!: brant bjork's music is complete. This is dense,juicy rock. the type of stuff that you'll crank in the car driving 100 miles an hour in the middle of the night.the small minds of rock critics would lean on the old ""stoner rock"" cliches, but Bjork's stuff is beyond that. these are good sounds...true,thick, spacey, simple. the grooves nail you in the gut and keep you awake through the dark of night. LOUD is the word!"
positive,Very Enjoyable: This book is thoroughly enjoyable. Although it is only a short novel. You will fall in love with the characters and the story.
positive,Oh hell yeah!: This is the best damm album if 2007! I'm serious. I love it. This is some punchy industrial metal that I never thought would ever come back...and it came back with an explosion. Buy the album!!!!
negative,"It's just a nice to OK documentary: It's disappointing to say the least. I'm not sure what Suzzette Phillips is talking about in her review, but on my version the classic album rumors isn't on my dvd. (And nowhere on the disc or packaging does it say the album is contained on the disc. Possibly, there are two versions? Anyway, 75 minutes of interviews about each song, and vintage footage each lasting about 15 to 30 seconds. Nothing new is on here that you haven't seen on any other documentary. It would be great if they played the vintage live selections in their entirety."
negative,"Where is the ""eject"" button?: ""Eject"" is becoming the most used button on my remote control, especially with films such as ""Altitude."" Save your money for something more substantial."
negative,"One of the worse by Mel Gibson: Helen Hunt was her usual self - acted well, portrayed a good character and was beautiful. Mel Gibson, as much as I looked forward to seeing him in the movie, was uncomfortably ""gay-like"" - and by all means I have nothing against gay people but he wasn't trying to act like one in this movie, he was trying to be a hot shot women's man. He just couldn't act it. Somehow Mel is not good acting funny in that way. Storyline was so-so. I would say rent it if you're curious about the movie, but don't bother buying."
positive,"Must read for SCI-FI Alternate Reality buffs!: I couldn't put this down. I hadn't realized it was a series till near the end when things obviously weren't going to wrap up in a few pages. I was both frustrated and overjoyed when I reached the end of this book. Overjoyed because there were sequels to read, frustrated because I didn't have them! Amazon will take care of that. :-)"
positive,"Makes an excellent gift!: I bought the sea animal and the Horses ""floor puzzles"" to give as gifts and they were instant successes. These days, kids no longer get this kind of toys, so they are always curious about them. The fact that there are so many different themes makes them all the more attractive. I highly recommend them!"
positive,"""Detox"" pretty damn good...: I'd agreed with my fellow reviewer on ""Retox"" (CD #1), but ""Detox"" makes up for it -- it's a totally different sound."
negative,"Not as great as I was expecting: I was assigned to read for my honours English class and I have never read a more stupendesely boring book.It's a revered book but it lacks everything that makes a book truly great.It's poorly written,uninteresting,the characters are unlikable,there is very little theme or characterization,the plot is virtually non-existent.The chapters are so meandering and pointless you have to force yourself to read it.English students shouldn't have to suffer by being made read this incomprehensible,boring, overrated 'novel'.I'd rather watch paint dry than read this book again.Still,any insomniacs looking for a cure,this book's for you."
positive,"INCREDIBLE MOVIE: I am upset that this movie isnt as renowned as it should be. This is definitely one of the most creative dark comedies Ive ever seen. I love movies with a passion, and this movie has truly made my week. It follows 2 roommates who live together while trying to persue an acting career. They are trying out for the same part and constantly judge eachother with their thoughts...however, the thinking turns physical and the movie gets WILD. I give my word that whoever is to check this movie out would NOT regret it. It is a movie masterpiece. Im actually going to buy a copy because I loved it so much. Check it out, trust me!-S"
negative,"Very boring, very uninteresting book.: I read this book not too long ago for a high school summer reading project and needless to say, I absolutely hated reading this book. I mean, I cannot believe how boring this book is. William Golding's book may have sold a lot of copies since the '50s but it's not high on my list of books to read again."
negative,"Not very happy: I'm disappointed with this product. I agree with the reviewer who said that the wire with the plastic button doesn't hold the cover firmly in place. This makes the food spill all over the ground. The holes are too big, too. I put tape on the inside over the openings to make them smaller so if the feeder tips less spills out. Also, when you fill it, it's too easy for the plastic sides to get dislodged--then the food really pours out. On top of all this, the birds seem to prefer my $7.99 feeder from the hardware store. I'm not going to toss this, but I wouldn't buy it again. More trouble than it's worth, and wasteful."
positive,"Second Grade Fantastic: When this arrived, I was surprised by the smallness of it, as I was hoping for a large picture book suitable for reading to my preschooler. Turns out the size and content are PERFECT for my second grader, who is pleased to find some new Bible stories (especially OT) just a little bit challenging for her. Sidebars bring the history to life, as photos from the Middle East, or of Biblical reenactments, are captioned and explained to show how people lived then, and still live today in some places."
positive,"Stop verbally trashing great films: This movie has gotten both good and bad reviews. While this film is not as violent as made out to be, it's still pretty bloody. But the violence that it does have puts you in the perspective of the character experiencing it. Be it Marilyn Burns or the infamous Leatherface. Unlike other horror films, and believe me i've seen a lot, this one puts you in the action. Even though i was weaned on movies like Scream, i have a liking for classics such as this. One of the greatest movies of all time."
positive,"a good time for all: Characters brimming with personality, and locations beyond imagination, it's hard not to get lost in the imagination of Periphery Stowe right along with Riggs.Though at times showing evidence of being a first novel, it hardly detracts from the beatiful prose and obvious skill the author has for writing.spread it around to your neighbors, your kids, your neighbors kids, all will enjoy.I'm just wondering what tricks Wagner has up his sleeve for his next book.."
negative,"Frustrating: I think the fit of the bra is great, but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable. The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides. I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric; didn't work. I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape, but I just can't."
negative,"Perhaps the most disturbing book I ever read: I'd give this book a zero and put a warning label on it if I could.I love Julia Child and usually enjoy anything written about her. So, it was with great anticipation I started this book. The concept seemed interesting and delightful.I had to stop reading after the first few chapters. The language is crude and vile... keep it away from your young ladies... or any lady for that matter. There was nothing about this writer that would make me want to spend any more time with her."
positive,great: i dunno wat evrybodys sayin that the pedals dont work because they work fine for me and wit all my games including gt3. this product is great definetley get it.
positive,"A classic novel with a contemporary message: Hawthorne's masterpiece is beautifully written and skillfully constructed. It's message is subtle, yet pervasive: that people we punish as ""sinners"" are often far more noble than their punishers. Judge not, lest ye be judged. Best (or worst) of all, the story is still wonderfully applicable to contemporary life. Perhaps President Clinton ought to wear a big scarlet letter 'A' on his chest for the rest of his term."
negative,"Ehhh...: I really wanted this to work, but my fine hair was blown off the brush. My hair continued to be wavy and frizzy after use. It's going back."
negative,"Ok: It wasn't too bad, it's nowhere as near as good as the first one but it isn't completely terrible. Good for rainy day watching, kids will like it, the first one holds up better for adults. Only real complaint is that the characters are sort of dull."
positive,Great Baby Book!: This book is one of the more natural baby books I have seen. It offers places to put each memorable moment of your new baby's life. This is also the first baby book I have seen that does not assume that the baby is christian. The art work is lovely too!
positive,Great movie!: It's the Mummy need I say more? Great movie for the family (except may be really little kids) and the sequel is just as good as the original.
positive,One of my Favorites Growing Up: This book was required reading at least twice in grade school and I never complained. Something about it made it an instant classic in my mind. I fell in love with the characters!! It's short and sweet but still a wonderful read.
positive,"Interesting Novel About Leadership and the Military: Right from the start, I was engrossed in Sam Damon's character and the storyline of this novel. It starts with a small town boy who decides to make his career in the Army and follows him through WWI, peacetime, and WWII. Damon enlists and then is made an officer through a wartime commission. Its a compelling storyline, but most of all I found its inner-woven leadership lessons to be the most interesting aspect of the book. Sam gets presented with tough choices over and over again and finds a way to make the right decision each time. Yes, its not realistic, but it does teach important lessons. For a young military officer, this is definitely worth the read. For a very long book, it does go fairly quickly. However, it was about 300 pages too long. I lost interest about 3/4 of the way through and couldn't finish. Overall a very good novel."
positive,"An exciting novel that will thrill all: This novel is about a young girl who finds herself in posession of a book of magic. With it, she can do whatever she wants, and even meets a friend in the same position as her. If you liked the Harry Potter series, then this is a book for you, but the plot is a bit too complex for young readers."
negative,"A modern-day ""Reefer Madness"": I watched this film with some at-risk teenagers and probably the funniest comment I heard was, ""They made this movie like a documentary because the rest of it is so fake."" When I first saw it, I was like other people who think that this is an artistic reflection of real life. I grew up with kids who used drugs and sex for recreation, and I imagined that things had gotten worse since I left my teens.Then I listened to the comments of teens who have lived in crackhouses, who have been shot at, who were raised by folks who traded their bodies for drugs or cash - and THEY'RE saying this movie is unrealistic.Telly, with his multitude of willing virgins, is more a dark fantasy of a teenage player than a real teen - rather like ""Reefer Madness,"" which had more to do with middle-class America's fear of marijuana than actual drug use. I wonder if this film will seem as dated in a few more decades as ""message"" films from the '60s and '70s."
positive,"A guide for everybody: This is a great book,it takes the time to point out to us all what we miss by not living life to it,s fullest.The only thing I can fault this book is some of the words in the book are not used today so some of the meanings are lost .I know the words used were common for the time but for the average Joe today it detracts from the story."
negative,"one of the worst books I've ever read: typically, I will force myself to read even the worst books (for class, for ""fun"", because I think I should), but when I read this book for a [...] English course, I quickly realized it was one of the worst books ever (not to be taken lightly, seriously), certainly not worthy of a classic, boring, endless details that no one cares about... blah blah blah. Terrible. I was bored. It might have been too difficult for a 9th grader, but I wouldn't read it now either.on the other hand, my brother loved it."
positive,"A Most Enjoyable Book: A very enjoyable book written by a great writer and a great American. Mr. Franklin tells about his early years and what is enjoyable is to hear the way some of the great ideas he had were then carried out. Every thing from the postal department, partnerships, even down to street cleaning.The price is right and very interesting not only for historians."
positive,"zoo tycoon a must buy!: ...it is totally adictive.u start off by the practice game 2 get u started and then u can play freeform! with soo much 2 do (caring 4 your animals, building exhibits, restraunts, reptile houses, water fountains,gift shops, elephant rides) u wil always be playing on it no matter what!the music is really cool and if you get bored of building your own zoo try the sceniros.(u have 2 do the tasks they want in a limited time only.)oh and becarful cos if your animals r not happy lots of terrible things happen so beware!!!!!!!!!"
negative,they are just banking off the name: this has nothing to do with halloween 1 or two this is just another way to bank off the name. there is no myers in this film. this is crap even if it was tittled something different it still would suck. halloween 4 is the sequel to halloween 2 not 3
positive,"Outstanding performance: I got to see this talented duo perform live twice last year, and was thrilled when they released their first recording. I love their program - quite varied and different from what any other duos out there are playing. The performance is pristine, and the recording quality is great, with nice stereo separation between them (I believe Risa in on the left channel?). My only gripe is that the recording level is a bit low, so you've got to crank the volume quite a bit (still sounds great though, especially w/ headphones). The Prelude, Fugue and Variation by Franck alone to me is worth the price of the disc, I can't get enough of that haunting theme. This is my favorite CD purchase of the past 6 months."
negative,"Not as good as it could have been: In watching Clay on TV, I was in hopes of great things from him in his first CD. It was VERY vanilla! Nothing spectacular...or stretching. I think he played it safe and I was hoping it sounded a bit better. I won't purchase it. I borrowed the CD from a friend and decided not to buy it. I think you'll be disappointed if you purchase this CD."
positive,"Compelling drama: Dot Com is a compelling drama focused on a small company based in NYC. It slyly incorporates the processes by which the SEC and The Street work, regulating businesses. Multiple threads of plot are interwoven, in a foxy manner. Character's personalities come to life and complement the story. Settings in NYC, Washington DC, and VT (among many) ring true. It is clear the author is a foodie, appreciating a good restaurant meal as part of the action."
positive,"Bronski Beat, Communards and Jimmy: This compilation should actually be named as the above title as the album consists of 4 hits from Communards. All are gems. With the superb digitally remastered sound, this CD deserves 6 stars."
negative,"Disappointed to say the least: After using a different type of Pampers, we purchased these. My 10 week old premie has had numerous blow-outs in these diapers. His clothes end up wet often and they feel much cheaper material than Pampers Swaddlers. I definitely won't purchase Baby Dry diapers again!"
positive,"Review of Visalia STock Saddle Co Reprint catalog of 1938: This is a great reprint of an old catalog. It shows all of what was in the orginal. Saddles, chaps, saddle trees, hats, boots, bits, spurs, and some clothing. This is a great referance book for the person looking to research old equipment that they may have. I would recommend this just for informal reading if you like old west items. It includes prices of items in 1938. This book makes a great addition to your library."
positive,"Great alone or with a crowd: This is a very engrossing game. If you like to organize things, just so, this is the activity for you. You can really puzzle over how to match the blocks both internally and externally, or you can just focus on the external organization. Or, if you have really little kids (like, under age 3), you can use the blocks for building imaginary things, like the Great Wall of China. You can use these blocks as a one-person game or with a bunch of people, and there are no winners or losers. It's just a good be-together or be-alone activity. Truly ""Zen"" blocks. I love this toy and have used it for ten years now. Highly recommended."
positive,Don't know much about the Civil War?: This is the book for you! Pratt's writing draws you in and on even while he provides you with the difficult to read details of battle movements. He also captures the many personalities of the Civil War in a vibrant way including much humor along the way.I can certainly understand why this is a long standing classic of Civil War history.
positive,A sentimental Must Read: This is one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading. It is a wonderful bildungsroman (coming of age story) about a girl growing up in the city. Her father is a loving drunk but her mother is a hard working woman who encourages her children to work at everything they do. I really enjoy this book and read it every couple of years. Definetly worth the time it takes to read it--- wonderful story.
negative,"often-boring book about heartless people: The characters in this book make my skin crawl. Salamano beats his dog, Raymond beats his mistress, Meursault kills a man for no reason, and then a bunch of stupid court officials try Meursault for his character instead of his crime. Meaursault himself seems psychopathic. As someone who has been diagnosed with moderate recurrent depression, I have felt miserable for long periods of time, tried to disengage from life, and believed that existence has no meaning. A lot of people have had these thoughts, because life is cruel and unfair. And yet, unlike Meaursault, we haven't killed anyone.Maybe if it were the first existensialism I'd ever read, I would have been impressed. As it is, I just think The Stranger is a bleak book about a bunch of terrible people."
negative,"VERY disappointed and frustrated: We purchased this Castle instead of the Playmobil model because it looked like alot of fun. Intended to be 'built', we thought it would encourage our son to use his imagination and be creative. Unfortunately, as soon as we snapped the pieces together, it fell apart before my son had a chance to enjoy it. It is a constant struggle to keep it 'together' and even with the slightest bump, it comes apart and causes frustration. He has totally lost interest because it doesn't stay together long enough for him to become involved in the whole adventure that is supposed to be inspired by such a toy. It has many neat features, and had it stayed together better, I would have given it 5 stars. I wish I had spent the extra money and bought the Playmobil, obviously the better choice."
positive,"This album is sooooo great!!: I'm 15 years old and live in the Bronx. I love this album. I got it two days after it was released. It was worth the wait.The title track ""She Rides Wild Horses"" is so great. I originally got the album because of ""The Greatest"" but I've listened to the whole thing and love it. I've listened to it so many times, my best friend is ready to kill me! If you're a Kenny fan without this album, go out and get. What the hell are you waiting for?"
negative,"I wish I could give 0 stars: I must admit that I'm not a big Van Damme fan. Still, I try to keep an open mind. Not only was the sound terrible, but it was so obvious that the punches were checked, that it would have made a comedy if the plot weren't so boring. I think that Woody Allen could make a better action picture than this attempt."
positive,"I admire the Heroine...Sizzle and Very Touching Romance: My first read by Teresa Medeiros. Many reviewer said her books are Magical, and This book is really Magic. My first read theme ""Tortured-Blind Hero"" and its written nicely.I starting to like ""Florence Nightingale"" story starting from Sandra Brown's book "" Adam's Fall"" which is my top list romantic book.I also found Teresa Medeiros's writting style quite easy to read, fast paced & also with nice twist. Shall find more of her books.Yours Until Dawn can really make me laugh and sometimes I'm not realize tear drop from my eyes, oh.. what a very touching romance worth reading with a lot of sizzle.Wonderful tough Heroine.. not because I don't like the Hero, but it is understandable if suddenly lost all the color of the world.This book is full of MAGIC!"
positive,"Awesome Book!!!: This book was one of the best I've read in a while! It's story continues in Eldest, then Brisingr!!! It's about how a farm boy named Eragon finds a dragon egg. After a short while a dragon hatches--which he names Saphira. Eragon raises her, and then becomes a dragon rider!!! I recommend this book to everyone!!! (ALONG WITH ELDEST)"
positive,"Sort of a slow start, but a GREAT story: Everyone has put an emphasis on this book being written by a 17 year-old, but this is a good book by any standards. If you didn't gather this was a fantasy from the cover, it is. The story is set back (at least its back in my mind) in a time before electricity, guns, and many other modern conveniences; in their place the story gains Dragons and magic. I've finished all four books and enjoyed how well they go together and develop each other.This is one of the first series that I managed to get truly immersed in since Harry Potter (I know!). If you enjoy fantasy, be sure to give the Inheritance series a try."
positive,"AMAZING BOOK!!!!! YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVE NOT!: I am not an avid book reader, but I LOVED THIS BOOK! I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN! I am almost done reading it again, because it is such a good book! I am going to start the LOTR books next and I am sure they will be the same.LOVE TOLKIEN's imagination and writing style!GET THIS ASAP!"
positive,"Works well with the Tivo series 3 HD: Just plug it in to the USB port on back and the Tivo series 3 HD ask you if you would like to use it. Tell it yes and it is an easy setup if you know anything about your wireless G router setting. (SSIS, Security Password WEP, WAP, Etc Be sure not to set it on top of the TIVO as it reduces signal strength. It has a pretty long cord long enough to get it away enough not to be effected."
positive,SUPER!!!!!: WHEN I GOT THIS CD SET I WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH IT. THE SHIPPING TOOK NO TIME AT ALL AND ARRIVED FASTER THAN I EXPECTED. THE MOVIE CD WAS GREAT AND I LOVED THE ADDED MATERIAL. THE BONUS CD WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING THOUGH. BUT ALL IN ALL I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TO ALL.
positive,"The best yet and more to come!: I am from Tracy's hometown and went to school with him,however it does not make me prejudice. I love his music, because it has meaning,depth,rhythm,and touches your soul.He has come a long way and has worked hard to get where he is today. No matter what comes his way, he proves to be a better singer and person, because we all have lessons to learn. That is what life is all about, isn't it? He is also a wonderful down to earth person and I hope he keeps on doing what he does best!"
positive,"Something Wicked This Way Comes By Robert Cortez: A masterpiece of modern literature, Something Wicked This Way Comes is the memorable story of two boys, James Nightshade and William Halloway, and the evil that grips their small town with the arrival of a dark carnivalone Autumn midnight. How these two innocents, both age 13, save the souls of the town as well as their own, makes for reading on timeless themes. What would you do if your secret wishes could be granted by the mysterious ringmaster Mr. Dark? Bradbury excels in revealing the dark side that exists in us all, teaching us ultimately to celebrate the shadows rather than fear them. In many ways, this is a companion piece to his joyful, nostalgia-drenched Dandelion Wine, in which Bradbury presented us with one perfect summer as seen through the eyes of a 12-year-old. In Something Wicked This Way Comes, he deftly explores the fearsome delights of one perfectly terrifying, unforgettable autumn. O"
positive,"Another Great One by King: After some disappointments (to me) by King, he's given us a book worth reading and talking about. Great read with plausible concept. Reminds me of Mr. King's earlier books. I understand it's going to be a movie, and hopefully will be just as good as the book."
positive,"Good scent but pricey: This sunblock has a good scent and it a lit bit greasy. As all sunblocks sand will stick to your face.I previously had one that had a citrus scent but it was a different Neutrogena bottle. I definitely buy this the citrus smelling one again.This particular one has a fresh scent.I would recommend this product and actually all Neutrogena sunblocks because it doesn't smell like sunblock. But if you find the citrus scent one, I would recommend that one more but it's in a smaller bottle."
positive,"Direct Hit: This is the best action movie I've ever seen. I've never been a big fan of techno music before, but it is used so effectively in this movie that I found myself drawn to the soundtrack afterward. If you can appreciate cinematography like a fast-paced music video, you will absolutely love this film - guaranteed."
positive,"A nose by any other name...: I have to admit I never liked Steve Martin as a comedian. In this movie, however, he shines, dispalying his excepitonial tallent as both a writer and actor. It's a brilliant piece of work.I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said, except this: If you haven't believed any of the other people raving about this film, take my word for it and buy it. You won't be sorry."
positive,"Irresistable!: The first time I heard ""All the Things She Said"" on the radio, I was hooked. I couldn't get that song out of my head. So every time I was in my car, I was hunting through the stations madly trying to find it again. Then, I decided that song alone was worth a purchase of this CD. And I was pleasantly surprised to find an album full of songs so catchy that you will be dancing furiously when you are listening to them and humming them constantly when you aren't. On top of the 8 or so original songs, you get a couple interesting Russian versions and even better, a music video AND an interesting behind-the-scenes look.What else can I say? The duet are sexy Russian lesbians(this alone will gather much attention and interest from the guys) with pretty voices and beautiful, melodic tunes. I look to T.A.T.U's future with much interest. Don't miss this album! It's so much better than most of the ... out there."
negative,"Great concept. Poor implementation.: The D-Link DSM-320 is a great product in theory. However, the actual product leaves much to be desired. Basically, this is just a confirmation of what everyone else here has been saying. The remote buttons are barely responsive, it is unable to play 90% of the files of each of the formats that it claims to play, shuffle is useless without setting up a playlist, and other ""basic"" functions are missing. This product was definately released to early. An as an early adopter, I got burned this time. I will be returning this thing tomorrow."
negative,"Waste of money-""master"": The system required a check in the rating box so I gave it a one, which is probably two too many. I have tried/owned two of these devices. The concept is good, but that is the end of the line for this product. As someone else noted the bands are not strong enough to withstand even an attempt to put your finger thru the finger holes. I even continued to try and use mine after the first hole tore loose with continued failure of the bands. At the price even if used as a squeeze ball it is too expensive."
negative,"GILLETTE PRODUCT ONLINE FAKE FROM CHINA: AFTER CONVERSATION WITH GILLETTE, I GOT INFORMATION, THAT NON OF PRODUCT SOLD WITH GILLETTE NAME A LEGAL. GILLETTE NOT AUTORIZED TO SELL ANYONE AND DON'T HAVE ANY ONLINE STORES TO SELL THEY PRODUCT.ALL THOSE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD FROM GILLETE MADE IN CHINA AND BEING A BAD COPY/ FAKE PRODUCT.BE WARE AND JUST CHECK BEFORE YOU BUY"
positive,"The Duke knows Rock 'n Roll: The reason Duke Robillard is one of the finest and most influential guitarists on the planet is represented well on ""You Got Me"". The man is so capable and authentic in so many genres of music it's almost beyond belief! No other guitarist (with the rare exception) can play Texas rock 'n roll, rockabilly, blues, country, jazz and swing, all with equal virtuosity. The Duke would be at ease playing with Count Basie, Hank Williams or Chuck Berry in the same night! This album brings back his great rhythm section, the Pleasure Kings for several cuts as well as Jimmie Vaughan, Dr. John and others for a simply fantastic listening experience. All Duke Robillard discs are highly recommended."
negative,"Do not buy the CD set!: I love Douglas Adams, and I love to hear his recordings of his books.I like The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul well enough to have worn out my audio tapes.I bought the CD version, but disk 6 is a messed up recording. It starts repeating parts and pieces of the same chapter over and over and never gets to the end of the book. The end of the story is not included on the last disk. I am not the only one to have found it so. You will be left hanging."
positive,"The trick is to keep being a child: When some dull reviewer wrote somewhere in some Yugoslav quasi-intellectual pop-rock magazine that the new Garbage album isn't worth a penny, I was really eager to hear it. And not only to hear it. I bought it immidiately. It is one of the last (or perhaps, the first?) bands that successfully mix the punk influence with pop melodies and some techno sound. Sometimes they sound like a new-wave band, sometimes sing the beautiful ballads (""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"" or ""You Look So Fine""), sometimes they sound angry (""I think I'm Paranoid""), but all the songs that are here get along really well. In spite of all the differences between the songs, the album sounds consistent. Energy, joy, sadness, tenderness, love, hate. What else does anyone want from music?"
positive,People get ready: Eva Cassidy. What can one say. She was a shining star whose voice was a fine instrument. Her loss to music slowed the earth. This is an outstanding collection.
negative,"Ugh! Argh! Stay away from this pile of fuming dung!: Holy Cow! Who told model-girl she could act? I'm sure the casting director who made the call is long out of work by now. The only redeeming quality of this film is Dustin Hoffman. Other than that, it's a total joke. Even John Malkovich made me wretch (and I usually love him). If you're really curious, rent it, or maybe catch it as it flies out of someone's window, or perhaps you'll find a copy at the dump?"
negative,"Works, barely.... Buy a better one....: My tires were a few pounds low, and when i filled them with this pump it took forever. I mean I was there for 10 minutes, and it only added like 1 lb. It also can't run for more then 10 minutes, or it gets hot. I would recommend something else. this is OK to have in the car, but it might burn out by the time you fill your tires. Also, the guage is not accurate. My tires are 30lbs, it consitantly read 40lbs."
negative,"Do not order if you want JUST calcium!: I ordered this looking for a calcium supplement. This came with Magnesium, Zinc, Copper, and some other crap. First of all, I already take magnesium so now I CANNOT take this or I will be super loading on magnesium. BUT the bigger issue is the inclusion of zinc. Zinc, when taken with Calcium, is NOT absorbed. This is a waste of zinc."
negative,"KILL ME, PLEASE: either me or the 12 grade teacher who assigned this piece of crap. This book was so terrible no one is my class read it, out teacher would have to come to class with 25 photocopies of the pages we were going over because no one would ""remember"" to bring thier book to class. As a story it was poigent and overdone, as a character, Tess was an insult to women everywhere. She had no backbone unill the end of the novel. fankly, I liked Hardy's poetry better and wish this book would be removed from all required reading list."
positive,"One of the best female artists ever!: The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is one of the best albums ever! Her voice is so beautiful and she puts so much feeling in her wonderful music. She is not a racist, her music unites all races of people. She is a beautiful person inside and out and I cannot wait for her next album."
negative,Not Happy: I recently purchased a used 8 GB View. It works well as a 8 GB View but will not support an 32 GB SD card. The literature on the internet said that it would support a 32 GB card.
positive,"Excellent analysis of America today.: Kevin Phillips writes a very detailed explanation of how different special interests have brought about the current American crisis. The book is roughly divided into thirds: oil, religion, and credit. Phillips starts very slowly, but picks up when he gets past oil. His anger at the religious right is palpable, and he makes his case against their excesses clearly and with great rigor. The third section on credit moved along more quickly than I expected. The book is well researched, the examples plainly described."
negative,"beyond horrible: This is THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! Seriously! The original Halloween is great, but this movie... ugh! I'm someone who usually enjoys cheesy low budget pictures as long as they are amusing. This movie seems like it would be amusing: the story involves killer robots and a mad scientist who wants to kill everyone on halloween. But it is far from amusing. It is extremely bad. Not bad in a goofy way, but bad in a nasty, unpleasant way. It is needlessly and excessivly gory, it has nothing to do with the rest of the series, and the guy who plays the hero looks like a gorilla. There are no words that would describe how horrible it is. To find out, you have to watch it for yourself - but please, don't! You will regret it for the rest of your life."
positive,Great Read: This is the second book I've read by Markides. I really enjoy his interactions and narrative reporting from Fr. Maximos. This book and his other works are helpful additions to those who seek to expand and grow their spiritual life.
positive,"The ILISA Spanish language school recommends this book: We checked out all the guide books on Buenos Aires and this handy little guide is the best around. We run a Spanish language school in Buenos Aires and although an update would be welcome, you can't get a better book for just under $ 10."
negative,"literally the worst movie i've ever seen - 0 stars: not only does the awfulness of this movie scare me, the fact that so many people actually like it scares me even more. like another person said, i'm no elitist snob.. i thoroughly enjoy ""stupid humor."" austin powers 2 is one of my favorite movies.however, austin powers 2 actually made you do something which a comedy is supposed to make you do: LAUGH. see, good comedies have something called ""jokes"" or ""gags."" revolutionary, i know.this movie has THE dumbest plot i've ever seen, THE worst acting you can ever conceieve, and it is THE worst attempt at comedy ever committed to film. if you like this movie, you're either 7 years old, or i don't want to know you."
negative,"Horrible!: No preservatives, no MSG, also NO flavor, and NO spice! It was like eating plain ramen without any seasoning at all. If you're a vegan and you're looking for vegan snack foods, look somewhere else. This isn't worth the money."
positive,"A crucial book in the St. Germain series: I have been reading this line of novels for about five years, and have often had to read them out of sync since they can be very hard to find at the chain stores (and I have no good local stores to go to). I must say that this book should be one of the first that you read if you are beginning the series (which I HIGHLY recommend). The story is set in Nero's Rome and introduces two of Yarbro's main characters (Roger and Olivia) to the story arc. The writing is magnificent, and the attention to detail in the historical background is wonderful. Rome is portrayed as a wonderfully alien place rather than ""Americans in Togas"" that some historical writers seem to go for. I have a few more Yarbro novels waiting in my read pile now (Thanks Amazon!) and I can't wait to read more."
positive,"Measure of a Man: I love eveyone of the songs on this CD. The voice of Clay Aiken is refreshing and mezermizing. I'm amazed that in this day and age with the stuff that's out there that an album such as this is even possible. The music and words are beautiful and very reminiscent of music from the 80's. There is actually hope for music today, thanks to Clay Aiken."
negative,"Wow the battery life is bad!: If you have ever had an iPod you will kick yourself for buying this player. Replaced my iPod Nano because the battery life was fading. Unfortunately, there is no way to get the advertised 35 hours of advertised battery life. You should expect 6 to 8 hours.It is crashy. It occationally corrupts the tracks when it crashes. The screen is average. Getting podcsts to show up as podcasts has been frustrating. Forget about video podcasts. You will be spending a significant amount of time formatting them. Of course, you should expect even worse battery life.The reason the iPod Nano is $130; it works!"
negative,Terrible: The all time worst book a teacher ever made me read I wouldn't make my worst enemy read this piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!
positive,For school: I needed this book for my kids. They have to read it for their French school (we are French).Did they like it ? I don't know... But I suppose they like it as all students who must read books...
positive,great game: this is a great game. it has many people in it and alote of legends but 1 of the turn downs is it doesn't have all the WWE legends.i still give it a 5.try this game out because stone cold said so (haha)
negative,The Number?: Overly simplistic and unrealistic. Not much help in planning for retirement. Mostly a bunch of stories for the rich.
positive,"""Constantine"" is great!: ""Constantine"" is great! Keanu Reeves is great as John Constantine. The directing by Francis Lawrence is excellent. The music by Klaus Badelt & Brian Tyler is excellent. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is excellent. The film editing by Wayne Wahrman is great. The casting by Denise Chamian is great. The production design by Naomi Shohan is excellent and visually masterful. The art direction by David Lazan is excellent and visually masterful. The set decoration by Douglas A. Mowat is excellent and visually masterful. The costume design by Louise Frogley is excellent. This is a visually thrilling roller-coaster ride that entertains and surprises you."
negative,"Fantastic Movie, Terrible DVD: What was Universal thinking? One of the great thing about DVDs in the ability to skip the previews at the beginning of most VHS tapes. The first thing this DVD does is disable all controls so it FORCES the viewer to watch ALL of the previews, including one for that horrible 'Cat in the Hat' flick. The only button that works is EJECT. That's right, you can't even select STOP!"
positive,Great: Well paced novel with interesting characters and plenty of plot twists. Patricia Cornwell writes characters that are real and have depth. Her mastery of criminal science is wonderful and offers a sense of authenticity that few authors achieve.
positive,"Beyond 5 Stars: This doc does for Stalingrad what Ken Burns ""Civil War"" did to the ACW. Outstanding archival film research resulted in never before seen footage of Operation Blue & Stalingrad (especially life in the Kessel). 99% of the footage is genuine late 1942 vintage, and quite a bit in color. This is a MUST-SEE on HDTV. The doc also reveals a stunning secret regarding the Kessel, but I won't spoil it for you. I have $3K in English, Russian & German Stalingrad books/video, and I would buy this one again if I had the choice. You can't possibly regret this."
negative,"""Waking Up in Nashville"" put me to sleep!: No question the author, Stephen Foehr, knows his stuff about Nashville. He obviously spent a lot of time interviewing well-known (and not so well-known) country artists, as well as people behind the scenes - producers, writers, etc. The weakness in the book, from my perspective, is that it is too wordy. There are too many details and too much repetition. I found myself skipping ahead to more interesting parts of the book.If you are interested in reading a very detailed ""fact-book"" about the state of the country music industry in Nashville, then this is your book. However, if you're looking for a fun, engaging read, you might want to look elsewhere."
negative,"The Worst!: I am a longtime Amazon buyer and a first time reviewer. I am also a Pampers Swaddlers devotee and so I thought, a fan of Pampers in general. I have since found that all Pampers are not created equal. I typically use Pampers Swaddlers in the day and Huggies Overnights at night for my 8 month old son - who is not by any means a ""super soaker"". I bought the Pampers Baby Dry because they had a good deal going, so I thought I would give them a try. With ""12 hours of overnight protection"", what's not to like? The first night I used these, I found my son's entire frontside wet in the morning. Okay, so it's hard to find a really good overnight disposable. Maybe I should have bought one size up from his usual. I thought, ""I'll just use them during the day..."". Well, after just 1 nap and about 3 hours in the diaper, again soaked. What a waste!"
negative,It actually did nothing!: I ordered several of these for stocking stuffers and they were sticks with multi colors on one side and a solid color on the other side - nothing magic about it and the explanation for the magic part was lame. Not worth it if it was given to me!
negative,"Afflu-Repetitive: I had to read this book for summer reading for an AP Gov course. It was a dreadful experience. It was very difficult to force myself to read more than one chapter per sitting because of the book's repetitiveness and dullness. If you actually want to read it, let me save you the time while I summarize it:-Spend more time hiking than working.-Don't get a well paying job, because it will make you miserable and you will undoubtedly go into dept.-take a low paying job, because life will be great. As long as you dont want to buy anything.-Don't buy material goods that make you happy.-Only nature and people make you happy.-Rich people, 90% of the time are littering, stuck-up, scumbags.pack that into 250 pages, and there you go."
negative,"Hmmm....: Well, I got it in my mind that I wanted to read some Ray Bradbury and figured this was a good place to start, and now I'm not so sure. I have got some MAJOR gripes with this book. First off, being that there is absolutely nothing believable about Jim or Will. Not a single instance of these characters seeming real. Secondly, the way that Bradbury structures sentences in this book has to be some of the worst grammar I have ever seen in a publication, major or independent. The thing that really gets me about it is that this is pretty much an internationally love piece of fiction and I just can't see the justification of it. Even the actual story itself, which is wonderful in idea, is completely underwhelming because of the way Bradbury writes this novel. I still want to read Farenheit 451, I certainly hope it's much better written than this book is. Not to sure I can honestly give this book a recommendation to anyone."
positive,"Good Product: This item does what it says when it comes to playing media off your PC using wireless. The setup how ever took me some time to figure out. The media server that comes with it is not very good as I had a had time linking my media files to the player.After searching the internet for an alternative server I got this one called TVersity, it is brilliant and now I can play all my media content with no problem."
positive,"good product: Its an ok value for the money, would buy from amazon again in the future. thanks for the good deal"
negative,"just clench your teeth...: Well,it's my OWN opinion...and nobody must agree with me...but why the writters almost always must(?)do strange or sometimes just stupid things with Alexander??It's disgusting.Why they couldn't do something like that with anyone else:-(?To add,this book have poor plots,and only merely describe the Aluwnans .There are my thinks after my first reading-maybe when I reach for this book again, I'll be in better mood,and will write here about ""Genesis Force"" sth more positive."
negative,"I loved the other books, but . . . .: The first three books of the Wizard series are three of my all-time favorite books. They are extraordinarily well-crafted and wonderfully intriguing. It's easy to sympathize with the characters.Imagine my surprise when I read #4. Ugh. The characters have lost their individuality. The plot is thick, convoluted, and unexplained.If you don't own the first three books, BUY THEM RIGHT NOW! But don't waste your time on this one."
negative,"Certainly not the Worst Movie Ever!: This is definately worthy of the MST3K treatment. It's really lame! Super Mario Bros. is about as playful and challenging as an unplugged pinball machine. While it isn't as bad as it is said to be, it is an early example of why videogames don't make good movies. Oh well, it's definately worthy of an MST3K treatment."
positive,"C: This was a refreshing movie. No adult language, sexual insinuations, etc. This is a real family movie that all can watch with ease. ""Stuart Little"" was a definite breath of fresh air."
positive,Creative music: Lester Bowie seems to always be creative and no two recordings of the same tune is the same. Very great music.
positive,"favorite diapers: I love these diapers, baby never soaks through them and they seem to be comfortable for him to cruise around in."
positive,"Great Ep: this rocks they are right now one of the best bands out. Mirror Spirit is one of the best songs to come out in a long time. The only band out that is better then these guys right now is silvertide, and possibly Rose Hill Drive. Sounds like classic 70's 60's rock and roll. The singer has a great voice, I believe his name is Eric Shea and there lead guitarist is a girl but she can really play. Expect to see these guys again because this completly rocks out. Rock and Roll is here to Stay.down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.The DarknessJetHurricane PartyParchman Farm (Only have an ep out but it rocks and you can find it here on amazon.)Rose Hill Drive ( have an ep out but not on amazon. They toured with Van Halen and completly rock and the guitarist is incredible.)SupagroupTokyo DragonsYoung Heart AttackBlack Keysand the best new band Silvertide"
negative,"Don't bother: I saw this movie when it came out and it was good at the beginning and the tiger arena was cool; but then it dragged ALOT. Also the director wasn't being reasonable, 'cause what are the odds that a roman emperor would fight a gladiator in an arena. Plus wouldn't the emperor's courtiers realise that he was a phycopath. And he is because HE KILLED HIS FATHER. ..."
negative,"Great book, bad performance: As much as I love Ray Bradbury and all of his books, he should have the good sense to have an actor read Farenheit 451 -- Ray stumbles and mumbles his way through the book, to the point that his beautiful writing loses all it's power and grace. Can't recommend this version, although the last disc is a nice interview with Ray about his writing process."
negative,"Be Somewhere Else Now: Bland, boring, nasal, banal, lyrically bankrupt, musically sophomorish, imitative, empty, hollow, stupid, not worthy of the CD pressing -- let alone comparison to the Beatles. There, I think that covers it."
positive,"Read ""rage"" First: This novel has some of the same characters as Himes' Rage in Harlem. This is not a sequel and it is not imperitve that you read ""Rage"" first, but I think that you will like this book more if you have read about Coffin Ed and Gravedigger Jones in the early novel."
negative,"Most pathetic character in all of literature.: Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the worst books I have ever read. I read this book in high school, though I am now in college, but don't discount this review because of that. Tess has absolutely no backbone. She pines away for stupid Angel who is more cruel to her than the guy who raped her in many ways. I know women weren't as strong at that time but even so, she is still pathetic. When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end. I disliked all of the characters so much, that it made the book have not one redeeming quality to it. If you want to read a Hardy book, read Mayor of Casterbridge--it is much better!"
positive,"This is a Special Book: It does not matter if you are interested in Struts. This book is written with a view to the ideas behind Struts and in any MVC architecture for a web framework. This is a tour de force in knowledge of the area, punctuated by the succinct sizzle of a man that knows how to communicate. Ted Husted is a writer among writers in this area."
positive,"Great Shogun Assassin 5 films package (DVDs): My husband loved it. We first say this show on TV many years ago in black and white. For me it was quite bloody, but my husband enjoyed it."
positive,"Definitely Brief: I do like the book and use it alot for school. The part that I use most is the Directory of Words Cited. Unfortunately, many times the exact type of work to be cited is not listed. For instance, a book with an editor in multiple volumes in an edition other than the first is not covered. Neither is an article from a journal obtained from a database."
negative,"Over Rated Sensationalism: It was later said when Joyce was dead and buried that he had confessed to a close friend that ""Uylsses"" was a completely fabricated joke that he used to get revenge at the world with. He was drunk most of the time he had put pen to paper and he threw so much of the text out that its suprising that most people hold this pretentious amateurish work as the greatest novel of the last one hundred years. The prose is vague, uninspiring and chatoic, there is no plot line what-so-ever, it's just a meandering stream of undelicate and unsophisticated garble from a minor artist."
positive,"?: Fair video, in that all movies/dvd's give the producer's view which is not necessarily the truth of what actually happen as they make film fit their story line."
positive,"New England Wire & Cable: Other People's Money is a wonderful movie, full of smart dialogue, good music, and a terrific Danny DeVito performance. DeVito is his usual funny, and easy-going self, while Gregory Peck is a strong-willed patriarch. Very good stuff there. The weakest performance is from Penelope Ann Miller, who isn't really convincing as the corporate attorney, but the material is so good that it saves the movie. This is a 5 star film, however, it loses a 1/2 star, because of the last scene, which feels a bit tacked on. Otherwise, a smart and funny film from the director of Moonstruck."
positive,Excellent and from the Boris Karloff era: This movie brings back the scarry movie themes from the past. The mummy is a creature of passion and horror and the supernatural that we all wish we will not run into. We need to believe in something supernatural and the mummy captures todays tenology and yesterdays myths. Forget all your preconceived ideas and enjoy the movie.
positive,"Not for new King readers: All of Mr. King's work's are good; some are better than others. DREAMCATCHER, unfortunately, goes in the ""others"" category. The story is complex, the references to earlier works (IT, TOMMYKNOCKERS) are plentiful to the point that a casual reader will think he's missed something. Still I enjoyed it (as I enjoy them all), but I would not recommend this as a place to start if you're not already a diehard King fan."
positive,"One Of My Favorites: This book, So You Want To Be A Wizard, is one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. It has an amazing story line that only some authors can come up with. I really enjoyed the magical methods of carrying out their tasks. When I read a fantasy book, I really want it to take me away into another place and reality and this book acomplished that well. I thought that the creativity of the creatures and entropy were so clever, with all of the carnivorous cars and the dragon in the subway. The setting on New York City really put and interesting twist on the plot that left me thinking, maybe in all of those deep dark places, maybe there really are dragons and wizards saving the planet and the universe every day. I read a lot of fantasy books and this book along with all of the other three in the wizardry series are definitely going on my favorites list. I highly suggest reading this book and it's three companions."
negative,Poor Quality: The DVD quality was poor. A lot of the scenes were too dark to see and the scenes would skip brief moments of the movie or replay moments of the movie. Overall it was a very poorly produced DVD.
negative,Didn't work: The game didn't work when we opened it. The laser on one piece didn't work and it didn't help to change the battery.
positive,"Dilbert Watch Out!: Wow, what a great book. Easy to read, and a book that everyone can relate to. Lights! captures situations in a perspective where we can easily laugh at ourselves. It's definately going to give Dilbert a run for his money, and maybe Tom Peters wil use it for some new material.Great job Tony!"
positive,"Agar Double Feature: Invisible Invaders is the better of the two. Aliens take control of the dead (Plan 9?) and attempt to control earth. Agar (Major Jay) and some scientists work feverishly to find a way to stop the invasion. Good 50's sci-fi. However....Journey to the Seventh Planet lacked the substance to be proclaimed ""good"" but is a fair bowl of popcorn,late night, sci-fi spoof about a creature bringing the space explorers memories/fantasies to life as he plots to come to earth for a takeover. What it lacks in action it somewhat compensates in the humor dept. I also saw a familiar spider and heard familiar spider ""noises"" which im convinced were ""borrowed"" from Earth vs. the Spider. All in all a good package for the price of admition."
positive,"A little bit of everything...: This book is great, it has different sections to get around in France. It even has a section about curse words and hitting on people. Even tells me how to say I am rich and single. Has a section on decoding the menu which is one of the things I was most concerned about. I can't wait to use it. I will keep it in my back pocket as I travel the country."
negative,A VERY VERY VERY SORRY GAME: this game will never earn akklaim ne sort of money except for ppl who like these kind of lame games it really isnt gwd really the cameara angles really bad too the grphix ok but who care bout grphix when u cant even get a good view of ur character nd the surroundings u will get bored of this game fast dont buy dun ever rent it im serious this game is so confusing too when u collect hearts it doesnt even tell u information on how to get the heart except a wierd riddle they give you that doesnt make any sort of sense plus once u manage to get a heart u get too strart over isnt dat fun u loose all ur extra life u earned and all the heart pieces u earned u need 100 to get a heart wow say u got 99 heart pieces then u pik up a heart guess what u get to start all over collecting the heart pieces dont even rent this game this game is so sorry i bought it and it took me forever to trade with my friend for one of his game i had to give him 5 games for 2 games
negative,Don't Waste Your Money: This product although is a very good idea is cheaply constructed and the clips that hold the trash bag in place are very hard to get on and off and you end up ripping the trash bag. Keep your twenty bucks and give it to one of your kids as payment to hold that trash bag for you.
negative,"What was this....trash is what it is!!: I was not happy with this book. Luckily I checked it out at the library, so I did not spend the money on it. It was filth, trash, and poorly written at that. I wanted the erotic sensations like the vampires get when drinking blood. Instead I got nothing but sorry, flabby writing that went nowhere. If the book had belonged to me, I would have burned it!"
positive,"Didn't come with a case: I mainly bought this game so I can complete my Resident Evil collection, but you only get the actual game disc and not the game case. So I can't display it or place it on the shelf...wonder if i can buy just the case somewhere lol."
negative,"Noble House - A Huge Disappointment: After reading the previous four novels of Clavell's Asian Saga, I was very disappointed in Noble House. Shogun, Tai-Pan, King Rat, and Gai-Jin were absolutely fantastic; exciting with a lot of action and colorful characters. The characters in Noble House are excellent, but the constant detailed diatribe about the finances of taking over the Noble House was way overdone and constantly repeated. I'm amazed that Clavell wrote this book because all the hashing about money consistently stopped the ACTION of the story. The first thing a writer learns is to keep the action going. I found most of this book as boring as watching paint dry. The plot lines about espionage were good and Clavell should have expanded that story line and cut out the constant rehashing of the bank's problems and Casey's ""drop dead"" money. Like, we got the point."
positive,"This CD is a must have for every music lover.: I just heard Vaneese Thomas sing on the Mall in Washington, DC. Her voice is so powerful and yet in the next breath angelic. The lyrics of her songs touch me deeply. They encourage me and reveal a close, personal walk with God. This CD is a must have for every music lover. It's the next best thing to hearing her live!"
positive,"LOVE IT!: I just got this from a local Stop and Shop and LOVE it! It leaves my hair so soft, smelling good and you can't even tell that I have any product in my hair. I'm reading a lot of reviews where people are saying that they can't find it anywhere. Depending on where you live, try your local grocery store!"
positive,Great Movie: This movie is awesome and makes any day better. This is a true story and I recommend that everyone see this once in their lifetime.
positive,"pretty good documentary: overall, the documentary was pretty cool. however, about 99% of the beach boys clips were from a prior documentary, an american family from '85. they should have included the clip of dennis singing manson's song never learnt not to love (aka cease to exist). especially since the title of the movie is the beach boys & the satan. but did have cool footage of interviews with dick dale and dean torrence and the chantays. also kim fowley was cool too."
negative,"READ THIS FOR HONESTY: I bought this product hoping for a nice poker chip set.It came a week late(i have prime, so this was very sad...)Not only was it late but the carrying case cameBROKEN at EVERY END.The chips are very nice and high quality, so if you don't care about the case, buy it anyways.I simply had to return it because I needed a way to hold and store my chips.Case-0/5 starsChips-5/5 stars"
negative,"Stalker Love Ballad?: ""Invisible"" is definitely the creepiest song I have heard on the radio in recent memory. The lyrics seem to describe a stalker. Tell me you aren't weirded out when you hear:""If I was invisible/I could just watch you in your room/If I was invisible/I'd make you mine tonight"" and ""I keep tracing your steps/Each move that you make"". There are definitely some hidden messages running through the background of this song.. Quick! Hide your children!I haven't heard all of the songs on this record, but I have heard many (on the radio, watching Aiken's performance on SNL, etc..), and from them I can deduce that this is yet another generic pop compilation churned out by the bloated record-machine that is American Idol. Clay does have a great voice, though, which is a refreshing change from most of today's pop.Lyrically and musically, I give this cd a 1. Clay's voice brings it up to a 2 1/2, which unfortunately is not an accepted rating."
negative,"It really had potential, but....: Although I am an avid Anne Rice fan, I initially bought this book because the back cover proclaimed it to be ""the modern Story of O"". Since Story of O is one of my favorite books in the genre of erotica, I just had to buy it, but then it seems that such sweeping claims hardly ever turn out to be true.... The book starts out strong, with intensely erotic scenes focusing on Lisa and Eliot and the beginnings of an interesting love story, but as the book progresses the characters seemed to become less and less realistic: by the time I finished it, I felt extremely unsatisfied. If you're an Anne Rice fan, this is a good book to read, if just to see how she fares in a genre other than horror, but overall there's much better erotica out there, and this book definitely does not live up to its claim of being as good as the Story of O."
negative,"average video: I really enjoyed this video on the whole. It will certainly get your buns in shape within a couple of weeks. The only negative part of the video was that some of the views of Tamilee were inappropriate. It seems as though the video was trying to focus on her body as opposed to the routine. On a number of occasions, we are shown Tamilee's bare buttocks in her thong fitness outfit. This is totally unprofessional! It is obvious that she wanted to expose her rear end during the video to sell more copies! Is it really necessary to walk around without any clothes on to sell your video?"
negative,Poor quality.: The suction cup did not stay on the wall and the radio did not work. The light never goes off.
negative,"False Advertising: The Abyss single disc edition is a cool movie, but the actual movie is not in Dolby 5.0 as Amazon.com or Dolby 5.1 as the DVD jacket would have us believe, but only in Dolby 2.0 (2 channel) English or French. I tried both the theatrical and the special edition cut, same result.Buyer beware."
negative,Old School Rocket: Launcher broke after a couple of flights. Not surprising for the cost. These were popular when I was a kid and this model WAS enjoyable while it lasted.
negative,"not kindle ready: It's hard to put together any nice words about this transcription. It is not kindle ready, although it is textually complete. Should be a freebie."
positive,"Tasteful handling of a national tragedy: 5 stars = I love it? No, 5 stars is my thanks for the delicate and tasteful, yet powerful and moving manner in which this most tragic moment in our nations history was recorded. LIFE exceeded its own reputation with the content and speedy publication of this chronicle - so we may never forget."
positive,"The winner is....""Inside Oscar"": If you enjoy the hype of the Academy Awards, this is the book for you. Plenty of behind-the-scenes action that you're not going to find by simply watching the Academy Awards. It's gossipy, dishy, and dirty...a definite guilty pleasure. Great index of past Academy Award winners and nominees as well."
negative,"Way too coarse and perilous: Show this movie to little kids? I don't think so. I wouldn't even show this to a ten-year-old, unless I wanted him to walk around saying ""damn"" and ""what the hell"" all day long.Stuart Little (the book) is enchanting. This movie is foul. Let's set aside for a moment that the plot of the movie is unrelated to the book. The movie as it stands does not measure up to what it could have been.Poor Stuart is so pitiful and miserable through 75% of the movie. Wasted potential.I wish it could have been a movie to love. The visuals and the animation, the settings, costumes, and characters (apart from the cats) are so, so good. But the trash-talking cats and the pathetic loneliness of the main character undo all the positives. No thanks."
positive,Mermaid Park rocks!!!: Mermaid Park was such a fun read. I can't wait to read more by Beth Mayall. The author made me root for the main character and made me feel like I wasnt the only one with teen insecurities re: boys and family. And what plot twists?! You definitely want to read Mermaid Park.
positive,"An emotionally moving story about faith, hard choices, and the healing power of forgiveness: Rorey's Secret is a novel about two families who find their faith in God severely tested by the destruction of a raging fire. One woman harbors a disturbing secret about what really caused the fire, yet she is trapped at a crossroads between telling the truth and betraying a promise to a close friend. An emotionally moving story about faith, hard choices, and the healing power of forgiveness unfolds. Also recommended are author Leisha Kelly's previous novels, ""Julia's Hope"", ""Emma's Gift"", and ""Katie's Dream""."
negative,"Terrible quality: This is not the version I remember as a kid, because some of the awesome sound effects are missing (wailing spiders, anyone?). However, that wasn't my problem as I was expecting this. What I wasn't expecting was the terrible quality of the dvd itself. It was fuzzy, WAY too dark, and the sound skipped around at least a half a dozen times. I reccomend buying the version with Bilbo and Gandalf over a blue background on the cover (I bought that one last year for my Godson). It still doesn't have the awesome sound effects that the VHS had, but at least its good quality!!"
positive,"Not that bad after all: Okay, the story isn't very logical all the time, and there's not much suspense either, but the amazing dolby 5.1 soundtrack blows you away ! Add to this the fantastic special effects and a few perfectly timed shock-moments -""The Haunting"" is filmed like a classic horror movie, but it uses state of the art technics to give it a modern look. Not my favorite movie of the year, but definately not the worst one either -give it a chance."
positive,"Decent Airsoft Handgun: I've had this airsoft firearm for a few months now, and I couldn't have been more pleased. Coming from my first handgun, it was a 12-shot Colt Mk4 that came with a spring rifle. Decided to get this handgun because I was getting sick with how difficult it was to fire my old handgun (after about 20-some shots it hurt the hands to continue pulling the slide to shoot). This handgun is still a single shot, but it's much easier to pull the slide back, which is surprising to see with how much power it packs behind every shot. The magazine size jumped from 12 shots to around 25, and I purchased a couple extra magazines that allow me around 75 shots before I need to reload everything. It's plenty accurate for the ranges I've used it in (something like 10-20 feet). Overall, a great sidearm to have for any airsoft shootout."
negative,"1984: 1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member of the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere he goes he is video taped by cameras of the so called ""Big Brother"" party. This books talks about Winston on how he thinks what the ""Big Brother"" does is unfair. I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Winston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction. Overall it was a good book, but I don't think Iam ever going to want to read this book again."
negative,a true throwaway effort: so i did. out the window one night. absolutely unlistenable. way too indulgent. [and i really like Gil].
positive,"Lol: This movie made me laugh out loud on and off through the whole thing! I was so surprised at that! It's about family, family secrets, getting along with or not getting along with, stuff that happens when family gets together-how you have to sometimes get along and accept the crap that comes along with family, etc! Who can't relate to that. If you watch it, I hope you like it!"
negative,"Yo-Yo Ma and John Williams missed the boat: I have been a huge John Williams fan for over 25 years and I am a recent Yo-Yo Ma fan. The new cd ""Yo-Yo Ma plays the music of John Williams"" was an extream dissappointment. I did not like one song on that CD. Use your money to purchase other John Williams music or Yo-Yo Ya music."
positive,"Still relevent for today...: 'That Girl In Your Mirror' is a charming example of the time honored values that shouldn't be forgotten. In her book Vonda tells young girls about growing up and offers tips and advice that I wish I would have had during my teenage years. While some of the style tips might be a little out of date (she suggests to wear gloves when in public) she gives great topics to think about relating to pagent ettiquite, finding yourself, and relying on Christian values."
positive,"Five Stars What Else?: After seeing Sister Carol in San Francisco last nightI had to get the CD right away. I listened to it all night and could not stop. Besides putting on one of the best concerts I have ever seen, she continue to deliver on her ""Promises, Promises"" with a stellar CD. Once again, Isis: The Orignal Womb-Man, has shown the way for her children."
negative,"this is the funniest movie i've ever seen: i watched this movie and thought it was hilarious i didnt go five minutes without laughing. I loved all the random animals that kept popping up, and i especially loved the way the french chick instantly started talking like a mongoloid while she was learning english. At the end i couldn't take away one good thing from this movie. It is just terrible"
positive,Parachute: Perfect for a few kids. It was used and enjoyed by three rambunctious boys repeatedly on Christmas day with a varietyof different games and toys.
negative,"Couldn't wait for it to be over!: I don't understand how anyone can like this trash. It was long, plotless (besides the whole wife commiting suicide thing-I would've too if I were married to Paul), random and most of the time I was asking myself 'what the f---?'I can understand that it was shocking for the time, especially that butter scene but otherwise, it was a huge waste of time. Its amazing how many people say how great this film is and Brando, but to me he was just a mumbling psycho that terrized a young woman. They had absolutely NO chemistry and most of the time, I had no idea what they were going on about. Overrated, overrated, overrated.2+ hours of your life you'll never get back."
positive,The Last dissenting Witness: The way Bill Sloan wrote Jean Hill's side of her story of the assassination was in perfect terms. Jean Hill was the closest person to President Kennedy when the shots were fired and she saw where the shots came from and the feds tried to cover everything up. I believe that Jean Hill really knew and saw what happened that day in November. Anyone who would like to find out information about the assassination I believe this is the right book to read and hear what was truly covered up.
negative,"Sick, disturbing movie: Cut from the same mold as Last House On The Left, this is another highly disturbing & unsettling hour and a half of a woman being savagely raped & humiliated. I couldn't recommend NOT buying this more. Rape scenes have always disturbed me, but to make it even worse is the fact that the woman in the film is raped for what seemed like an endless ten minutes by one guy, then another five to ten minutes by the next & so on. Five dirtbags, one after the other raping the woman & the rapes went on for a good twenty to twenty five minutes. The only reason I watched to the end is, as horrible as it was, I wanted desperately to see them get what they had coming to them, & they did, but it is no consolation for the gratuitous nightmare that poor woman went through. Really sick flick. Not entertaining on any level."
positive,"One of the Best Punk Albums Ever: This is probably the most important punk album since Never Mind the Bollocks. It combines a unique snarling rage with true wit and intelligence to produce this masterpiece. Political (or as they put it anti-political) but not preachy. But don't worry - you won't find the naive politics of bands like the Crucifux, the Dead Kennedys or Crass here. The impact of the songs of this album can't be overstated. I just wish they were still around. I wonder what they would be like now."
negative,Northwestern Bell 36247: The backlit display did not work nor did the memory call feature. The memory would store numbers but would not dial the numbers. The buttons and steps to use other features were somewhat awkward in sequence. I returned the unit to Amazon as I found it very inferior.
negative,"Ewww I dont even have to read it: I wish he came up with better ideas, too much like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. I understand taking elements, but taking the same entire story is pretty terrible and another thing. This book is like taking a paper bag, and turning it inside out, it appears different, still a paperbag, but what they have in common is that you can wipe your ass with them. :-)"
positive,"TWOBP is an excellent book: TWOBP (The Witch of Blackbird Pond) is one of the most exciting and riveting books I have ever read, right up there with NUMBER THE STARS, A WRINKLE IN TIME, and my other favorites. This book is beautiful and touching. You can read the plot synopsis above, but I wanted to add my opinions. I've read about these ""witch hunts"". No wonder they suspected Hannah Tupper. No, not because she had a broomstick or cast spells on people, but because she was a Quaker, and she wasn't like the Puritans. And different scares people. The lonely old woman lives by the swamp because she loves the Meadows. She doesn't go to ""Meeting"", so they make her pay fines. And then, one chilly night...but you'll have to find that out yourself."
positive,"Just Plain Good Music: Glenn Jones has one of the most fabulous voices of all time. He's right there with Luther, Marvin and the rest. Unfortunately he gets ignored for much less talented singers. If you'd just like to hear a fantastic voice sing fantastic songs, buy this. You definitely won't be disappointed."
positive,"Becoming Jane Austen: Nicely done movie and well acted as well! ""Becoming Jane"" shows us a young Jane Austen already dabbling in writing, but hasn't as yet grown into the writer we know her as today. This movie is really about Jane finding out who she really is and wants from life.In ""Becoming Jane"", we learn of Jane's family life and about the social circumstances surrounding life and etiquette during the era in which she grows up. Life is really confining for women back then. It seems that a woman is pushed into marrying a wealthy man regardless if her has feelings of love for him or not.... And being a spinster is definitely frowned upon altogether, let along deciding to create a career for yourself as a writer.We see a side of Jane Austen's personality we may never know about from reading her novels and about the love she gave up for the sake of foraging ahead to become one of the world's greatest women writers."
positive,"The Glory of Rome: I liked this movie very much. It embodies the days when honor and victory were pure and untainted ideals. You may not like actio films very much, but this film will captivate you with the action, as well as the story line."
positive,"An exciting World War II movie: I rate ""The Man Who Never Was"" as an excellent and exciting World War II movie. Why can't movies be made like this anymore? Recent World War II movies are not accurate and place too much emphasis on effects. In my opinion, the more ""special effects"" a movie has, the more fake it is. Anyhow, ""The Man Who Never Was"" describes the true events of the British trying to confuse the Germans as to where the Allies will invade - Sicily or Greece. By arranging to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain with top-secret documents, the British cause the Germans to alter their defenses, thus saving the Allies from suffering even more casualties. How the British found a body, the details that they had to come up with to make the Germans believe the body was for real, and the subsequent German effort to determine whether or not the information found on the body was accurate, all make for an exciting story which moves at a swift pace. This is really a great World War II movie."
negative,"Very disappointing: I ordered this new knife from Amazon based on the Laguiole name, prior Sabatier experience and the one review (5 stars). What a disappointment! One side of the blade had very visible tarnish and reddish blue spots (not sure whether rust or previously used). It also has a very light and extremely cheap look with poor manufacture. It is made in France, but it goes to show that junk comes out from there just as easy as from China, Pakistan or anywhere else. True you get what you pay for, but this one wouldn't be worth even 2 bucks at a yard sale. Maybe it was a defective unit, but I didn't want to take a chance with a replacement. I never even tried to use it, and simply returned it. To Amazon's credit, their return process was great. Just follow the online ""return"" process, print the (free/prepaid) return label, and take it to any USPS station. Amazon's service earned the second extra star."
negative,Whitey is oppressing you?: They agreed to publish and largely distribute one of her books. Most whites in this country will never have such a luxury. Hypocrite. Racist.
negative,Manipulator: I had to adjust the score on this book because I read a lot of books. Shery Argovs themeis manipulative.It is not trully honest to have true love in your life you need to be able to be you're true self.If you need to be a bitch with the man then he is not the one for you. When a man is in love with a woman she does not need to change who she is.
negative,"big disappointment: I was really looking forward to the release of this album. However, it turned out to be a big disappointment. I bought it this morning and listened to it for two times, and I can only say that I find it extremely boring. No melodies that can carry a tune (and those few melodies that might be able to do so are embarrassingly clichéd), no surprising song structures, no or hardly any remarkable or memorable guitar riffs. In absence of these things, bands quite often turn to 'oddities' like, for example, using technically wrong chords, as in ""Soon forget"", etc. Things like that may make a good song more interesting, but they can not turn a dull song into an exciting one. Unfortunately, it seems as if Pearl Jam have run out of ideas."
positive,"Like Finding an Old Friend: I read this book as a kid but that was long enough ago that reading it again was like discovering it for the first time. This is probably the best known of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and it it really deserves it's classic status. It is a gripping tale mixing crime investigation with a touch of the supernatural and is after 100 years still a page-turner. Arthur Conan Doyle helped start a genre that continues to entertain as evidenced by the countless crime novels and detective shows on TV. Despite the potential overexposure Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson still seem relevant and the deductive reasoning Holmes employs to solve the mystery of the Hound Of The Baskervilles is so entertaining that I read this in one day, unable to put it aside. Crime solving raised to a high art form never gets old."
positive,"!Awesome CD!: The Story of a Girl song was very popular a while ago, and still is a great song. Most songs played on the radio are the best ones on the CD...this is not the case here! When I heard the other songs, I was amazed to find that they were just as good! unfortunately, that wasn't the case with some other great songs played - like ""Pinch Me"" (Bare Naked Ladies)...all the other songs sound so old and kinda suck. Anyways...great song, great CD!~ you should get it if you like this kinda thing."
negative,"Neil Simon did this?: Don't even think of buying this DVD for a buck and a half, new or used. The film is a turkey, a television attempt to revive a failed play. Imagine a Neil Simon play without a single laugh, without a semblance of wit, without a glimmer of insight into the human condition. And you have London Suite. Why go into the details of the story? It isn't Plaza Suite or California Suite. If you think the agonies of a man with a bad back are funny, this is made for you. Poor Madeline Kahn, being reduced in her mortal illness to taking a part in this disaster."
positive,"Another must have for the Jazz Aficionado: For every true Jazz lover there are must have albums for a real collection. Satch Plays Fats, The Summit Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, etc.This album is another one. Generally when you think of Krupa and Rich what comes to mind are showman with talent but who just bang away on solo's. In this album you see the real talent to play with the best like Dizzy and Jacquet. I think however that Krupa really outshines Buddy on this album showcasing his jazz talent and not just the ability to bang away and show off.If only Barrett Deems and Cozy Cole could have done something like this then I would really have been happy!"
positive,"Good tunes and truly insightful, inspiring lyrics are here: I've been burnt a number of times when I take a chance on a CD based on one song. Too often the one you heard is the best of the bunch and the rest amount to filler. I heard the title cut from this album on our local Christian radio station and took a chance despite my past experience. I'm happy to say there's nice music here.Although the title cut, ""Boomerang"", has a nice hook and Bruce is at his James Taylor best, there's a lot more to be discovered on the other numbers.Good tunes and some truly insightful lyrics provide some really refreshing, inspiring Christian moments on this CD.Buy it."
negative,"Shakespeare: As we all have one time or another, had to read shakespeare in school for English class. That was my reason for this, my son needed it for school. I'm just glad it was available. He needed to Kill a Mokingbird, it wasn't available for Kindle."
negative,othello classic books on cassette: The reading is very monotonous as the reader says the names of each part before the part is read. It drives my students as well as myself crazy. We get through the reading faster by just reading the parts ourselves. I was very disappointed with the purchase.
negative,Almost bought this one!: Thought it was anamorphic! Thank you guys! Now when will we get the anamorphic version?
negative,Boot Hill: The picture quality sub VHS standard. I'm a fan of Terence Hill films but this was by far the worst I've seen. I would not recommend this to anyone.
negative,"Product great, software horrible: It's got great size and sound but the software is to difficult to understand, almost returned it.It took me 4 hours to compress and load my player with 50 songs"
positive,"Fully Alive: The noted architect Christopher Alexander describes ""The Quality Without a Name."" It is found in art and life. We instantly recognize it, but it cannot be defined. It is when something or someone is fully alive, harmonious, true to their essential nature. D.V. has this glorious characteristic. Her evocation of the 1920's to 1960's is priceless and more valuable than any history book. She is so true to herself, honest, larger-than-life, and filled with strong opinions without being narcisisstic. D.V. shows that style comes from within and that fashion is just a tool. I adore this book."
negative,BORING: What I do not understand is how people can like this book! It is really boring and I don't really like or understand that Jack guy. I think I would've given this book a better grade if it hadn't started out sooooo slow. Really if you don't have this book don't bother getting it unless you want to be confused the first 5 chapters and bored most the rest. It's just not worth it.
negative,"COULD NOT WAIT TO PUT IT DOWN: MY WIFE READ IT, SAID IT WAS OK. SHE AND I HAVE READ EVERY GRISHAM BOOK AND LIKED MOST. THIS BOOK BORED ME TO TEARS. IF IT WAS 10 CHAPTERS INSTEAD OF 40 PLUS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD SHORT STORY. DONT BUY IT, BORROW IT IF YOU MUST READ THE LATEST GRISHAM."
positive,"This Book Will Scare The Hell Out Of You: Vincent Bugliosi isn't kidding when he writes on the very first page ""The Story You Are About To Read Will Scare The Hell Out Of You"". Bugliosi somehow finds a way into the sick and distorted mind of Charles Manson, as he was the prosecutor during Manson's trial. He remembers small details from long ago, never moving over to another topic. ""Helter Skelter"" is a great albeit terrifying book."
positive,"Terrific Tina: To speak from one of her songs..""She's simply the best, better than all the rest""... I love this album...We should all strive to be so real, gutsy and honest."
positive,"I love this book!: I love this book! As a future teacher, it is very helpful. It gives many tips on how to help your reluctant reader. It also is an easy read and not boring what-so-ever."
negative,"Undercover?: I thoroughly enjoyed watching another T.V. while this show was playing out in the family room. The wife got a good night sleep and didn't even bother to replay the part she missed. After complaining, Hollywood Video gave us a comp, so all in all, we felt like we got our money's worth."
positive,"Not what I expected But: I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it, very good vocals, sound and production. This is not normally my style of music, but this is an excellant recording. I would normally give this two stars but added plus one for recording and plus one for production."
positive,"Sounds like a roller rink but in a good way: I really like LRD's remix of Cassius's song Feeling for you and this CD is the same style. It does have eighties style digitized rythm and I think its sneaky for him to pose as a French guy (though maybe thats those badboys at Astralwerks) but its a cool disc. You could definitely do worse. Also, it is consistent. So if you like a song you heard somewhere by him, you'll like the album."
positive,"Good Script + Great Cast= A Great Afternoon at the Movies: A great take on baseball. The cast made more of the script than was really there. Jon Lovitz at his best. Madonna and Rosie made a great team together. Hanks and Davis? What can you say. Just goes to show that you don't need a great script, just a great cast. The greatest line.... I'ts supposed to be hard. If it wasn't hard everyone would do it. A movie for anytime!"
negative,"Boring: I kept waiting to get to the interesting parts, but they never came! This book is 95% character development, and after such a long wait, very disappointing."
negative,"Full of seminal ideas, but a bit tiring because of that: Certainly it is interesting to read ""A Princess of Mars"" from a historical standpoint - it influenced a whole century of scifis that came after. However, exactly because of that - and because of the awkward, convoluted writing style of old times - the book didn't catch much of my attention and was not able to kindle my enthusiasm..."
negative,"Warning: The music on this CD is great. My comments have to do with the way in which Amazon describes the product. This is a CDR, without any liner notes and the track listing basically copied from the web site. But you will not learn this by looking at the Product Details. You will find this information under Editorial Reviews, where it says: This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.While this information would have been better placed under Product Details no where does it tell you that you will not receive the liner notes.Amazon is misrepresenting the product. I hope my short review will help others who are considering purchasing the CD."
negative,"pretty bad...: There are several problems with this keyboard. 1 is that it has no number pad. another is that the lights don't light up when you click Caps lock or num lock or somthing, so you never know if its on or off until you type something.The biggest is that the buttons just plain suck. You have to really push down hard to get the letter to register, it destroys your typing speed, and butchers anything you try and type.the only redeming quality is that you can spill things on it and then just clean it off."
positive,important for my research at college: This book is very important for american descendants living in Brazil. We can't let the culture dies.
positive,"oh, go ahead and read it!: I thought it was hilarious. It was as crazy as if any of the rest of us mere mortals tried to cook all of Julia's recipes in a year. UGH! I couldn't have stomached most of the recipes myself, but the reading is great fun!I loaned my book out the minute I finished it so someone else could have a lot of laughs. I hope the loanee's not as stuffy as the other ""reviewers"" on here."
negative,"Love the smell, hate the peeling: I bought this ""face lotion"" two months ago and for my face, everytime I use it my face peels and I break out in a red rash. I thought it might be a combination of this and another product, but even using Nivea face lotion by itself after two days without any other products (to include soap) causes it (I think I also have peeling issues with their aftershave lotion, so it might be their fragerance). I'm not saying this will happen to you, but figured I would warn others. I'm now just using it on my legs now and it seems to not cause any problems there."
negative,"A Very Disappointing and Frustrating Book: I have no doubt that Basil Pennington is a very loving and well-meaning man,and an expert on his subject. But he is also very maddening.If you want to know about the background to centering prayer then probably this is as good an introduction to that aspect of the subject as any. But if , like me, you actually want to know how to do centering prayer, then don't bother with this book. It tells you just about everything you could wish to know about the history, benifits, and application of centering prayer (it even tells you how to structure centering prayer retreats and seminars). But unbelievably, within its 254 pages Pennington devotes little more than one page on how to actually do it, and what he does say is vague and interspersed with latin phrases. I have the impression that Pennington has written something more explicit somewhere, but this book is definitely not it."
positive,"Love this product!: I am a first time Mom and I use this Boppy daily! My son loves to sit in it and he does drift off to sleep in it too. Both my husband and I prop our son up in it to interact with him and we don't have to worry about him tipping over. It is nice to have on the sofa with you so you can give your arms a rest with out the worry of the baby rolling off. It is also another place you can put the baby with out having to keep putting him in a bassinet or crib all the time. Great for tummy time too.I use it for nursing and do not have the problem of it moving around. In the hospital I used pillows and they worked fine, but the Boppy works much better for us. Pillows do have to be adjusted to get the right position for latching and the Boppy does not. I do recomend getting comfortable with some back support before nursing with the Boppy.Very good product and I do recomend it to all."
positive,Very captivating thriller: This film was extremely interesting from beginning to end. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have preferred a bit more content. There should have been better use of Bruce Dern. I hope there's a sequel.
positive,Disturb not the dream: I have read this book several times. Loved it everytime. Best book I have EVER read!
positive,"Surprisingly Good: Faith Hill has never disappointed me with any of her albums. Though not as good as her latest effort Cry, it is much better than her most popular album, Breathe. This CD has her most notable hits of the late '90s - This Kiss, Let Me Let Go, The Secret Of Life and Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me, a duet with her hubby Tim McGraw. One of my favorites is Love Ain't Like That but, unfortunately, it failed at radio back in early '99. And unlike most country albums of the '90s, the unreleased songs aren't filler. In fact, my very faves are Better Days, My Wild Frontier and I Love You - all unreleased songs. Surprisingly, Faith's version of I Love You is much better than the original Celine Dion version. After Cry and It Matters To Me, Faith is my favorite album by the beautiful and talented Faith Hill."
positive,"Post: quintessencial: Björk's Post is the sizzling second Björk's Elektra-album who really came to prove who she was and her place on the contemporary alternative pop music. This album consists in a non-stop sequence of hitsand pearls and is absolutelly heterogenic and diverse. The first track and single, Army Of Me, is a really strong electronic tune. Hyper-ballad is aclassical Björk song, following her innovative (but today very imitated) mixture of strings and electronic noises and melodies which began with Venus As A Boy, and the song is a real poem where she creates images of suicide thoughts. The Modern Thingsis another impressive electronic track, and It's Oh So Quiet her most successful single ever, a cover of a jazz classic where she really reinvinted the song and gave it a totally new and unexpected interpretation. Other pearls are Cover Me, Possibly Maybe, Headphones, Isobel, You've Been Flirting Again, evry one a totally different, lyric and strangely melodic track.Post is a classic."
positive,Fun movie: Loved the movie. Actually like to watch anything with Drew in it.So adorable. Anyway I would like to know which island most of the movie was filmed on. I would guess Maui but don't really know.
negative,Super dissappointed: I have not yet read this book but am looking forward to doing so as I have heard from friends that it is wonderful story. However I am super dissappointed at the poor quality of this item. The paper is obviously re cycled and has been cut extemely unevenly. I understand the need to recycle but was not advised prior to purchase that this is the policy of Amazon.. Consequently as this is the 2nd book I have bought in this condition I will not be purchasing any further from you at any time. I have sourced another good priced on-line book seller. Thank you.
negative,"Cut Face: This pack of cartridges must have been laying around in the back yard for sometime. Used all eight in two day's trying to find a good one, cut my face each time I tried a different cartridge. I guess this is one item you don't buy from an online retailer."
negative,Awful fit: I wasn't thrilled with the fit of this bra. It was stiff and the edges were so pronounced that even my thickest sweater couldn't hide them.
negative,"Thought I was ordering something I wasn't: I assumed that since the picture posted was a pic of a DVD, that I would be getting just that. But I should have read the information a little more thoroughly, turns out I was ordering a VHS. Too bad I got rid of my VHS player years ago and can't use it."
negative,"Woman in the Dunes DVD Transfer: ""Woman in the Dunes"" is a minor classic of Japanese cinema; beautiful to watch, intriguing, and with a superb score and sound track by Toru Takemitsu. The DVD transfer,however, is very disappointing. The manufacturer claims that the DVD version is a restoration made from the original negative. This may be true, but its a mediocre restoration, soft and much too dark. Night and many interior scenes are barely legible. This is the first premium priced DVD I've seen that is inferior to the VHS version, at least the cassette put out by the Connoisseur Video Collection."
positive,"Wait for the new Broadway Cast recording: I just read the NYTimes review by Ben Brantley and he loved the production. I love this recording for many reasons, but mostly because it does not have Manic Manny Patikin on it."
negative,Really? An adult wrote this?: Don't bother reading this unless you like reading literature written by a child. What a disappointment. James Patterson failed on this one. I think he hired a child to write it and then put his name on the cover. Big mistake James. Glad I didn't purchase this piece of crap!
negative,Should be listed as fiction!: You can go broke trying to find a good book. Save your money on this one. This is not worth the money and if someone gives you the book and brings it to your door don't waste your time reading it.
negative,"Mostly [bad]: Not only do most of the songs sound the same, its formula techno-pop junk. It goes from boring, to boring, in 45 minutes... Its pretty [bad]. What you heard on the radio or on TV is all they have to offer."
negative,"Not my type..: Pros and cons of the game...Pros:*Great plot,U have to become the best chef and beat the evil omni food empire.*Quite fun since u are able to join cooking competitions*U feel a sense of sastification when u watch people dine in ur restaurant.CONS:*GRaphics are a boo-boo,the graphics was blur*There aren't there many furniture to choose from unlike the sims.*VEry limited control-all u do is watch ur customers eat.At first,u will feell very sastified....but after a while u become very bored.U just wait for people to enter the restaurant and buy recipes from them.I really wouldn't recommend this game beacuse i had very limited control over the restaurant.....All i did was sit and watch the customers dine.....Now how much of a game is that?!I got sick and tired of it after two days of playing."
negative,"Worst Ever: This was the worst book I have ever read. There is absolutely no comparison to Harry Potter. The story is about a girl who finds a book in the library called "" So You Want to Be a Wizard."" She soon meets another young wizard in training and together they battle some dark forces. I thought this book sounded really good, so I bought it, but this book is boring, and not at all interesting.It is not creative and some parts in the plot are quite predictable. I do not reccommend it."
negative,"Bring Back The Old: My 2 1/2 year old will not sleep without Fisher Price's Peaceful Planet Aquarium. It has been great. Unfortunately, she has had it since she was born and just recently the motor that turns the fish in the aquarium stopped working. She had a fit so I told her we would get a new one. Unfortunately, the so called new one does not work like the old. She does not like the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. Why did Fisher Price change the model? If anyone knows where I can get a Fisher Price Peacefil Planet Aquarium please let me know!! Fisher Price should hire parents for R&D!!"
negative,"eXXXtremely [WEAK]: Typical hollywood drool geared for teens with gender identity crisis... all special fx and no meaningful plot,This movie (just like Fast & Curious) [was weak]!"
negative,"Don't Buy this if you have a 17"" Powerbook G4!: This power adapter has only half the Amp rating needed to power the powerbook G4 17"". It took 14 hours to charge the battery and still used the battery partially when the computer was in use and the power was connected though the adapter. I noticed that they left out the Amps it has in the advertising. The other reviews below must be fake or they have a smaller G4 powerbook or an iBook."
negative,"Vastly overrated: I bought this CD and was struck by how souless it is. The disk is nothing special though it has its moments, mostly in the last third of the disk. I don't understand the hype. Look elsewhere."
negative,"No more...: Rehashes the same 'moral' question about vigilantism as any Batman movie, but without action or laughs. The whole corrupt city being saved by a rich man is so simplistic and trite as to appeal to only the most sycophantic libertarian.Holmes' character is totally pointless. Bale, who is obviously talented after 'The Machinist', is emotionally flat. And the great actors of Caine and Morgan are left on the sidelines- one to explain emotion and one to explain gadgets.I wish I hadn't seen it as it erases some of my memories of Keaton and Bassinger and Nicholas in a movie that had thrills and laughs..."
negative,"not that bad , but not even close to the book: The film is not actually that bad , but instead of been call I Robot it should be call hardwire (scrpt's original name).For anyone that wants to see an Hollywod action movie itsok but if you want to see a film based on Asimov book ,don't see it because it's totally based on other story not even closed onwhat asimov wanted to tell about it in his books."
negative,"Noritake Colorwave 16 piece place setting: I ordered a 16 piece place setting , service for 4 but only recieved a 4 piece place setting, service for 1. I contacted Amazon and they arranged to have the order corrected and arrange for return for the incorrect order. Once to corrected shipment arrived again it was a service for only 1. I was charged for a service for 4. This was eventually credited back to me however since I only had 2 place settings, I purchased 2 others locally at Younker's department store. The dishes that came with from Amazon are different than the ones from Younker's. It is like the molds were different or something...the plates are deeper from Amazon and as a result the set does not stack properly. I am not certain if this inventory issue has been resolved with Amazon so buyer beware."
negative,"A good catalyst for discussion, but a dry, flat style: Our high school read this book for our Summer Reading Program. Most students and faculty agreed that the book raised excellent questions for discussion, but the dry, flat style of the writing made it very difficult to read. After falling asleep several times trying to read this at night, I finally forced myself to read it early in the morning. Bellamy spends much of the novel explaining how this socialist utopia functions, providing detailed analysis of the economy, government, education, and other institutions. I would recommend this book to readers interested in discussing political issues, but not for readers who need a strong plot or dynamic characters."
positive,Great for sensitive skin: I have extremely sensitive skin.Regular soaps cause me to break out in a rash.I love this product it has no harsh chemicals and is Fragrance Free.It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth not dry and irritated.I even use it on my face and I noticed a big difference in the look and feel of my skin.If you have problem skin or sensitive painful skin I suggest you try this product I'm happy I did.
positive,The best Disney film of all-time!!!!!!: Pinocchio is my favorite Disney movie of all time!!!!!!! I'm glad they decided to come out with a 60th anniversary release. It is up there with such movies as Lady and the Tramp and Bambi. It is a classic a must have!!!!!!!!
negative,"Lower Than Low: After finishing The Thread That Runs So True by Jesse Stuart, I sit here to give you my review on this book. Even though the book didn't catch my attention that much it had its ups and downs. The only thing that caught my attention while reading this book was how he fought back against the ""man"" and got his job back, but then he stuck it to them at the end. As for the down points of the book it would have to be the rest of the book. I could not in a million years honestly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book to read."
positive,"The greatest book you will ever read!!: Dude! When I picked up this book I thought it would be okay, seeing as it had a dragon on the cover and all. I was absolutely right! This has gotta be the most bestest book that anyone anywhere has ever written! It changed me for the better because i was very impressionable when I first read it, and I am sooooo glad. If you read this book then you won't be letting yourself down! (Trust me ;)"
positive,"Wasn't expecting much: I wasn't expecting much based on some of the negative reviews about this book, and perhaps that was why I enjoyed it so much. True, it's not at all like Grisham's thriller genre, but it does have the courtroom element and this, coupled with his styles in ""A Painted House"" and other great reads of his, makes it enjoyable and fun. The story itself is not that unusual but the masterful telling of it reminds me of ""King of Torts. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. Would also recommend ""In This Mountain"" and a great new book I just discovered: ""The Bark of the Dogwood"" by Jackson McCrae."
negative,Crap: Dont waste your money on this Chinese piece of crap. This plastic crap doesn't even work. DO NOT BUY THIS!
positive,"A book to live by: Kristine Napier is obviously an authority on diabetes as well as a nutritionist-- and we could probably cure a national epidemic (Type 2 diabetes) if we would all follow the advice in this book. But this isn't like one of those health books that preaches all kinds of impossible advice. It's filled with really simple recipes. The ones I've tried are easy to make, and taste delicious. It's food for kids as well as adults. At last, we've got a book on the kitchen shelf that we can trust completely."
negative,"Not for those well-seasoned in women's studies: After reading ""Women's Inhumanity to Women"" and ""Tripping the Prom Queen"" this was a disappointment. Maybe if I hadn't read the others first, it may have been eye-opening. As it stands, if you want to the real dirt on women's relations, this might be a good introduction. If you're like me, this poses no new revelation."
negative,"Is R Kelly in identity crisis?: R Kelly actually got me into listening to cool romantic melodious black music. His past albums followed a style typical to only him. However TP-2.com got me wondering whether he is losing touch to his unique style or whether he is just trying to prove he can also do what others are doing. Either way, it is a pity because the album didn't reflect his identity. It is not a CD worth buying even if you are a fanatic fan of R Kelly."
negative,"Don't go there: 'Coyote Ugly' often gets compared to 'Flashdance'and sort of falls in the same genre, but it lacks both the charme and the choreography that made 'Flashdance' a success. It is hard to blame the actors for the failure to maintain the audience's interest, they simply didn't have anything to work with. The plot is entirely predicable, and all the characters (how did they do that?) remain without any depth. As a result, the different plots running through this feature appear strangely unrelated, maybe because as a viewer one just doesn't get engaged. Easily one of the worst offerings in the last 12 months, maybe ever."
negative,"If it was not for Diane Lane....: If it was not for Diane Lane, this movie would have been a total loser. It's a swindle. It's advertised as ""romantic comedy"", when there is little (if any) comedy. It's boring, it portrays the Italians with all the cliches available. Blegh!"
negative,"Disappointing: Not a good version of Spy Hunter, as the maneuverablility is not good on this platform. Am awaiting a version of Super Spy Hunter somewhere. This is just not fun to play."
negative,"Embarrassing: I should have paid attention to the negative reviews. This unit expired shortly after the warranty did. It reported an ""Overload"" condition; resetting the unit cleared the condition, but it came back a few minutes later. APC tech support attributed it to a circuit-board problem that would require replacement of the entire unit. Elsewhere on the net, users attribute the problem to a faulty fan. Either way, a unit that cost almost $200 is now bricked."
negative,"Stolen work of Lars Von Trier: Else then creating personalities to cover his complexes (first Bachman and now Eleanor), Mr King has now bacame a thief. Go wach the original Tv-series art by Lars Von Trier, The Kingdom. A 8 part post-modern TV series about unnatural events that take place in a hospital.There must be a border between the art of writing/literature and marketing tricks. And Mr.King has just crossed it.Stephen is now writing under the name Eleanor. After Richard he has developed another personality. Just a marketing trick. AND HE HAS STOLEN LARS VON TRIER's work, THE KINGDOM (or did he bought it?)anyway it is all a fraud. Shame on you mr king.You may trick the ""culture-free"" illiterate americans. But not everyone."
positive,"Good Results: I purchased this workbook for use with church groups during Lent. The narrative was instructive and the use of scripture and other sources was relevant. We especially liked the suggestions for using each lesson throughout the day. We had our last session today and the feedback was very positive. Although we met in groups of 4 to 6, the workbook would be good for an individual also. However, the group setting encouraged more commitment than a person alone might be able to muster"
positive,excellent lyrics: If your looking for music that is true to life and chills u out on a sunny sfternoon then buy this cd...beautiful voice!
negative,"A Big Disappointment: After being drawn in by the magical possibilities of a Rossetti painting on the dustjacket (of the hardcover) and an epigraph from Mother Goose, I was disappointed that what followed was sheer hokum. Most disappointing: the characters are based on cliched ideas. For example, the author reinforces the tired dichotomy that women are either rational and practical or wild and irresponsible. And the author's primary characterization of all the prominent females in the book is that they are stunningly beautiful, as if she has nothing else in her bag of tricks to make them likable. This is a world where a woman must use her beauty to secure the love of a handsome man before she can like herself, and that is very unfortunate given the possibilities for strong feminine characters in such a storyline. The ending is likewise predictable and cloying, which seems to be a prerequisite for authors who eventually end up in the ""Oprah Bookclub."""
negative,"Maybe great for back-up power - but not as a jumpstarter.: I purchased it primarily as a jumpstarter for my classic VW...and secondarily as a backup power sourse in case of hurricane etc. It may work well for the latter - but after getting it, charging it for 3 days, and trying to jump my car - it would barely turn it over and was dead after 3 tries. Back to a $75 Battery Charger/Jump Starter for me."
negative,"Bad!: This is the worst printer i have ever had! Every time i tried to print some thing, it's paper jam, paper jam, and paper jam. stay away! if you want a printer scanner copier, get the psc 1610. lasted my 5 years!"
positive,"Great performance!: This is a great performance by the one and only Babatunde Olatunji! If you are familiar with his music, you are probably a fan. Many of his well known tunes are performed live on this DVD. I gave it four stars instead of five due to the fact that there seems to be a manufacturing defect on many copies of this disc. I ordered it three times from two different sellers and each time I had to return it due to a disc defect."
positive,"Classic period writing and unmatched Stout charm: Fer-de-lance remains the source one of Stout's greatest creations: Nero Wolfe. Not so much becuase Wolfe himself is such a great character but rather he provides so much for Archie to talk about. For anyone who missed out on the unmitigated energy, charm and social manipulations of depression era New York will enjoy the book merely as a period peice. THe dialog remains some of the best in mystery writing and those stuck in British cozies have something to move on to."
negative,"The Monkey Returns: I was expecting a great dvd experience, especially since I had no time to see it in theatre. Thank goodness I didnt see it in the theatre, and thank good I rented this movie instead of buying it. For people who make fun of ""No Brain Action Movies"", stop, cause they are supposed to be fun. However, this is a no brain movie with baddddd action. Infact, not enough action. You will note the following:-For some reason, the ""evil"" Imhotep from the first movie plays a little girl with no good powers.-The CGI Scorpian King at the end was sad, really sad. I would've prefered the Rock(Scorpion King)in a ""human"" body.-The comedy in this movie is bad, just not horrible.-Brendan Frasier's over-acting-THIS MOVIE IS NOT NON-STOP ACTION! TOO MUCH TALKING.I would not even pay 5 dollars to BUY this movie. If you like ACTION-MONSTER THRILLERS with LITTLE ACTION, BAD MONSTERS, and NO THRILLS, then buy this movie right away!!!!!"
positive,"A hilarious roller-coaster ride thru a mixed up life!: I loved its candid, campy humor, madcap adventures, and sixties rebelliousness. Very stimulating reading! Fun!! Holly's adventures are priceless. It was great fun living the journey... Brian"
negative,"Tasted awful and did not really work for me: I was referred to this product by a lactation consultant who swore by it. I had gone back to work a few weeks prior and my supply was dwindling severly due to the pump not being nearly as efficient as my little man. I began taking far more than the recommended dose of the More Milk Plus, in an effort to really up my supply. The product tasted really nasty, even when mixed with a strong tasting drink and I did not see any major difference in my supply."
positive,"Best album of 2002: There is no doubt that this album will have heads banging all over the world. If you listen to this second cd of this band (Toxicity), you will truly understand where this generation of rock bands is going. I don`t quite know what category this band (System Of A Down) fits into, maybe it's Nu-metal. For me, this album is simply the best albun of 2002. Serj Tankian with his naive and socially conscious lyrics and hypnotic weird vocal style is destined to become the Bono (U2 vocal) of Nu-metal. This Armenian album will make you hear a style of music that you will not find anywhere else. There are parts in some of the songs that are slower and then when you least expect they change into a heavy, head-banging style. I wish to see this Armenian band playing live here in So Paulo but it will take a long time, because the album has just been released. I suggest you give this cd a try, and when you find out that you love it, spread the sickness to your friends."
positive,"Eragon The Inheritance: Eragon is a great book for kids and adults to read. The reason that I thought that it was good is because of the action sequences. Christopher Paolini's choice of words made me want to read on. I really liked the creative names he used. Since he used uncommon names it made the story more interesting. For example: Eragon, Galbatorix, and Dras Leona were among my favorites. I also liked the different settings of Eragon because it made me want to go and visit. My favorite was the Hadarac Desert because of the challenges they faced. Some challenges the characters faced were thirst, heat and it was very tiring. The recurring theme in this story is good trying to overcome evil. If you enjoy intense action you should read Eragon!"
positive,"They're greeeeeat!!: My whole family loves them. They are crunchy, tasty, filling and healthy all at the same time. My teen takes them to school for a snack and I munch on them all day long.--A bit addicting though!"
negative,"not for kids!: This book really bothered me as a child and at the time I couldn't say what it was that bothered me so much. I think it was the spanking scene where it seemed kind of sexual-ized. I remember feeling scared for the girl and not liking the book. Because of these feelings I remember, I will not be purchasing it for my own children."
positive,"Great read for women of the west: This book was an interesting exploration of western women of yesterday. Much has changed over the years as I also enjoyed reading a contemporary view of a western woman in ""So You Wanna be a Cowgirl"".Pat Gott"
positive,"Call to be at peace: I have read two of Oriah's earlier books, the invitation and the dance, and the third in the trilogy i like even better than the other two. Oriah speaks to the reader with absolute honesty - on her relationships, her family, work, fears and hopes of everyday life - and how she deals with it. I particularly liked what she said about finding your 'word' or the one word around which inner dynamics evolve. And her clarity/differentiation between ego and essence is incredible, a noteworthy approach to practical spirituality needed for modern times.This is definitely not for the average self help person or someone who just wants to 'make it work' with ten points on how-to- it is more for those of us who struggle with finding inner peace and authenticity in all that we do. Also the author has a very verbose style of writing that may not appeal to many - particularly those who are not very word-oriented and that might be something to watch for."
positive,"Good for Kids: I looked through this book and found it to be very educational as far as various life lessons a child may need to learn. Really I do just want to point out that Larry Potter was copyrighted far before Harry Potter and that by saying it is a copycat is highly inaccurate and unfair. They are entirely different types of stories and styles and are aimed at entirely different audiences. So, if you are planning to buy this book for someone over the age of 5, they probably will not find it very entertaining. Otherwise, it's a great book for early readers."
positive,"Necessary for understanding Christianity: Whether you like it or not, this book defines Christianity for modern evangelicals more than any other text, excepting perhaps Matthew and Romans in the New Testament. Lewis is at his rhetorical and biblical finest. If you cannot admire his mastery of the form at the least, you ought get therapy for self-deception."
negative,bench: The bench is very nice. I had a few pieces that looked like they were painted over scratches and some of the metal were scratched. I was unsure of some of the screws as you can not tighten it too much or is strips the plastic. wasnt sure on the indents on the metal bars which way they were suppose to go on. the bench broke after sitting on it three times. The glider bar broke. the weld is not very good or sturdy.
negative,"What Were They Thinking??????: I hate to give any of the Halloween movies a 1 star rating but this one.... part 3 is the only one to me that deserves only 1 star. All the rest are great. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the first 2 Halloween movies at all and NO Michael Myers in this one. I think the whole storyline and plot is stupid. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this movie AND called it Halloween 3!! Thank goodness, the following 5 Halloweens follow the original!!!"
negative,"Great special effects. . . . . horrible cast: I rented the Mummy hoping to see a serious movie with awesome special effects. What I got were great special effects, and a mismatched cast. Brendon Frazier (not sure of the spelling) was horrible in this movie. His comedic style completely ruined what could have been an awesome movie. I was expecting an ""Indiana Jones"" type movie, but what I got was Encino Man being chased by a mummy. I would encourage renting this movie for the special effects, but thats about it."
negative,"Could this be worse?: Without the studio trickery, he would be doing community college musicals. The make-over doesn't do it for me either. I wouldn't spend the money and I'd give it away if it were given to me. What new lows will America's talent standards slip to?"
positive,"Lifelike pets!: My little girl loves this so much that I need to set a time limit or else she'll forever be glued to it. It is like having a pet minus the ""real"" work. Get it for your pet loving kids!"
negative,"apallingly appalling: This film could really be summed up in one word ""Appalling"". Van Diesel plays the archetypical 'action hero.' Yeah you've got it, the one whose status is big muscles and has 'I can't act' written all over his face! The trailer for the film looked absolutely awesome, which is the only 30 seconds worth watching for the entire film.I would love to explain in depth the details of the plot, but quite frankly I was too busy laughing at how pathetically shallow the plot was to even remember it.If you are a Samual L Jackson fan don't torture yourself by sitting through the film, not even the master himself can do it any justice whatsoever.Nevertheless as taste is unaccountable I can only recommend you rent this film from your local video rental store or whomever!"
negative,"The Hobbit is scary: The Hobbit, in my opinion, is the scariest children's movie of all time. All of the dwarves are incredibly frightening and look very similar to the stereotypical alien depiction....big eyes and over sized facial features. The music also adds to the terror, once you hear the tantric chanting. The goblins are also horrific beasts. I'm 18 years old and this is the scariest thing I have ever been a witness too. I strongly recommend not showing this to any young children."
negative,BAD: DONT READ!!!: I had to read this book for my school's reading list. It was by far the worst book that I have ever read. There was no plot at all. All of my friends also thought that it was bad. Even some of my friend's parents thought so too!! My final word is DONT READ IT!!
positive,"Enjoyable Read: Best SciFi book I've read in some time. I'm hoping that Mr. Reynolds comes up with some sequels.As for those who have problems with the science: maybe you would be happier reading a textbook. I'm sure I'm not qualified to declare that this book is SciFI, Hard SciFI or just a work of fiction, but I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone willing to not grouse about the science.My only complaint is that it was not available on Kindle."
negative,"very very dissapointed!!!!!!!: When i saw this movie i thought it would be better then all the rest of the nightmare movies with the exception of the first one(which is the best) Well, this move sucked alot! There was a few good parts but not enough, but most of the scary parts were taken from other movies and from all the other nightmare on elm street movies. I was very dissapointed Wes Craven can do 10 times better then this."
positive,"skeptical about pop music...: i'm usually really skeptical about pop music. if that pop sound is comin' outa the radio, ya gotta listen to the lyrics! Stacie sounds alot like Christina agulara, but i often question christina's meaning behind her lyrics, like in Genie in a bottle ""if ya wanna be with me"" and ""ya gotta rub me the right way"" really make me ask questions. when i listen to Stacie's album i know that what i'm listening to is clean and pleasing to God. this is defenitly the cd to buy, because everybody knows that you eventually memorize what you listen to no matter if you mean to or not. that also influences your thoughts. don't ask any more questions, just buy this cd right now!"
positive,"INTRIGUING AND USEFEL: Very few books come by in one's life that impacts life itself. This is one of them. This truly stands amongst other fascinating books in history.Shems Friedlander takes you on a journey from the most basic logical way of living to the most insightful understanding of the ***meaning of life*** itself. I couldn't believe my own eyes (and mind) as to how clearly and simply I was comprehending the most complex subjects of humanity, all told with many absorbing tales, delivered with a mastery of astonishing ease.Either the author is justly a genius, waiting to be discovered by the world, or he is truly moved by God to produce such a masterpiece, or perhaps both.In any case, if you were given a choice to read one book this year, make it ""When You Hear Hoofbeats Think of a Zebra"" by Shems Fridlander.Being an author myself, I will put my entire reputation on line for this book.Enjoy and Understand.Shaun H. Ajani"
positive,"Dawn on a Distant Shore: I had read Donati's series of six Wilderness books and really liked them so I bought this as a gift for my daughter because she had read the first one and liked it. They are long books but never boring. I thought the book would be a larger size, as the soft cover ""Into the Wilderness"" had a bigger cover with a little larger print but the book came quickly, was reasonably priced, and my daughter is happy to receive it. Donati is a really good writer. I only discovered her this year. - Fran"
negative,"The most overrated and undereditied book I've ever read.: Redunencies throughout, scant attention to fact, e.g., no mention that WAAC (Women's Auxilliary Army Corps) preceded WAC; no mention of Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby, the first commander. And was the woman mentioned Wonda or Wanda? I left my copy elsewhere, hence I can't pinpoint chapter."
negative,"I am the Blues: Disappointed in the mix on this live performance . Many lead instruments are hard to hear. Lots of drum rhythms and vocals. Guitar, bass and piano are not well-balanced.Talking to audience during the performance is part of the CD, which gets old once you've heard the chatting .Recommend going to studio work with better mix on his other CDs."
negative,"Never Cry Wolf : Amazing True Story of Life Among Arctic Wolves: To put it very simply, how can a fictional work be considered ""Amazing True Story of Life Among Arctic Wolves""? Very deceptive and misleading in it's title. A fictional book about wolves; yes, a true story; no. Read to enjoy a fictional world drawn up by Mowat, but if looking for a true life story stick to non-fiction writings as this is certainly not among those."
negative,"This batteries are completely worthless!!!: Purchased two of this batteries in September of 2007. They worked fine for a while. Stored them fully charged for about 3 months. When i tried to use them again both batteries had fully discharged, after charging them they each ran for about one minute each and died. Tried to recharge them but they wouldn't hold a charge no matter how many times or how long i put them on the charger. By comparison the original battery from canon only lost about one quarter of its charge in three months and is working the same as new. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT, they are unreliable. You wouldn't want to miss videotaping an important event due to battery failure."
negative,Much worse than I expected.: Mind bending stupid horror film that lacks any form of common sense what so ever with a script that was looked like it was written by a ten year old with dialog only a child could understand and a leading man who is as bad an actor as they come. Keanu Reeves can't act if his life depended on it and his performance here proves that in spades. The special effects are not really good and the direction seems forced in some places. The only performance of merit that this film has is from Rachel Weisz who does much more with her character than she needed to and she does lift this film pass much of it's problems but a good actor can do only do so much with out the help of the director or the rest of the cast and she's basically by herself in this film in terms of good acting.Avoid.
positive,"Great for video transfer!: Atlast I can transfer my videos from my HC32 Sony camcorder to my laptop! Works with Toshiba & Dell laptops, not sure about others. The iLink/IEEE 1394 port on Toshiba is also called S400."
positive,"Always entertaining!: All of the WEEDS seasonal series are great entertainment. Would recommend beginning with season 1 as the plot thickens with each season. If you are a ""little boxes on the hillside"" kind of person.........pull up a chair!"
positive,"Engrossing!: I was completely lost in this book, the storytelling was captivating! A wonderfully written book that made me want to read Chronicles in the bible! Excellent!!And so now I find I NEED to get the next in the series... I can't handle knowing there is more and not reading them! Good job on marketing - give me the first one free, sell the other four! :) But, if all four of the next as as good as the first - it'll be money well spent."
negative,"Ruined by neutering the artwork: I adored these books growing up and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for changing exactly what made them classics. I would have forgotten about them years ago if it weren't for the haunting illustrations. I took them camping, to slumber parties, they were fantastic and terrifying: which was the whole point. To be scared.I have nothing against the new artist and his work in general, but this is not the place for it. To change what made a book a classic for it's 30th anniversary is insane. I can't imagine what they were thinking.If parents are afraid their kids can't handle these books in their original form, they have simply to not buy them books that are meant to be scary or maybe, you know, flip through the book before you hand it to your child. Which is a sad thing anyway, I've seen nothing good come of raising children in a nerfed world, but still.There is no excuse whatsoever to censor such an eerie, memorable, and nostalgic children's book."
negative,"doesn't actually snap!: Received case well packaged and fast shipping! The case itself form fits phone fine, but does not snap well together. The first time I tried one of the top tabs broke. So for temporary purposes until I get a new case I used a dab of Gorilla glue to hold the upper two halves together. Obviously if I have to reset the phone this will be the end of the case. Only 3 bucks, but I would put that money towards a soft silicone case."
negative,"Quantum Mechanics For Dummies: I can't understand why Mr. Griffiths' undergraduate physics books are so popular. The low intellectual level of his writing can only discourage more advanced students, yet the physics is so watered down that you won't learn much anyways. His books read like a ""Physics For Dummies"" series.Griffiths' Quantum Mechanics book continues in this tradition. He introduces Schroedinger's Equation on the FIRST page without giving any of the traditional ""plausibility arguments"". He bypasses any discussion of the Old Quantum Theory (Bohr's Correspondence Principle and the Bohr-Summerfeld quantization conditions). He gives a watered down introduction to the Dirac formalism which fails to adequately explain Dirac's measurement theory and such important concepts as simultaneous eigenkets and non-commuting observables.There are innumerable superior QM books at the undergraduate level. Save your money and forget about Griffiths."
negative,"Low-rent MTV fare...: This 2002 remake of an old classic ranks among other blockbuster flops like ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""Waterworld."" It's the future and huge corporations control most of Earth. The one thing that keeps humanity together is Rollerball, a sport that is a mix of hockey, rollerblading, and pro wrestling. Paul Heyman is the announcer for Rollerball, proving that it is never a good thing to have a commentator with an annoying voice for your sport. Chris Klein is John, a young hot-shot who is learning fast that Rollerball is a tough ""sport."" He soon discovers that the corporations control everything that happens in the game. Okay, this is a boring film, lost in an emptiness that serves as a grave for the makers' credibility. Even excellent actor Jean Reno does little in the way of making this movie even remotely interesting. It is a monotonous, unexciting flop, a plaigerized version of the fun James Caan film."
negative,"Excelent story, short version: The book is excelent reading but please get a different version.This version only has 580 or so pages where as other versions have over 1,300 pages. That means that this version is only half the story.So much gets lost in translation already don't cheat yourself even more."
positive,"dont judge a book just on great reviews: the general cencus is that the all in one a+ certification book is the best on the market. while i will agree with that boast.dont let a snowball of never stoping great reviews of this book fool you. their are close to 40+ errors and typos in the book, and when it comes to test time that can kill you..."
negative,"Good for a few months: The adapter worked fine for my power book g4 for a few months and then it broke. Nothing physically happened to the adapter for it to break, but suddenly it just wouldn't charge any more. What's interesting is that the blue light on the brick goes on when plugged in to a power source, but if I plug the cable that attaches the computer to the brick in, the light goes out and it doesn't charge."
positive,"Marvellous work: Every two or three pages, the hairs on the back of my neck would prickle up. This book is marvellous and masterfully crafted.Recommended reading: anyone with the time to spare for perhaps the best read of his or her life."
negative,"Just not the same Quality as Canon Batteries.: After about a year of using this generic battery from China, the battery is quickly fading away. It will not hold charges and seems to make my camera actually reject the battery. When using this replacement battery, my camera will sometimes shut off or will not even turn on. I will not ever buy a cheap replacement battery for my expensive cameras. China is producing some really bad products lately, using cheap materials and cheap labor. Those products seem inferior to factories from other countries, especial USA, Japan, Germany. You have been warned."
negative,"Underpowered...: Unfortunately, I picked this unit up with much higher hopes than I should have.Setup was relatively simple. I know what I'm doing and I have an existing UPnP server on my network, so that made life a little easier. When you power the thing up for the first time, it steps you through network setup, locates UPnP servers, and makes it all go.However, once I got it running, I lost my optimism. Video was very choppy. It was completely unwatchable. I futzed with the settings on my router and UPnP server and video formats for a week before finally giving up."
negative,"Crappy release from Alpha again: From these reviews it is apparent that Alpha does not care aboutputting out quality DVDs.The worst I have ever seen was ""The Hitch Hiker"" and this one is not any better.What a waste of a great movie....I will wait until someone puts out aquality version of it !!"
negative,"Disappointed: I purchased the movie Shiloh to show to my students after reading the novel in class. Unfortunately, while the video quality of this DVD was just fine, the sound had a problem. We had to turn the TV up to maximum volume to just hear the movie. And yes, I did try other DVDs and their sound was fine so it was not the TV."
positive,This Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System is exactly what my family wanted for Christmas. They love it.: My family was so excited and happy when they opened their Christmas gift. They used it Christmas morning and it worked great.
negative,"I thought I was going to love this album, but didn't: I really enjoyed Clay on AI2, was one of the first in line to preorder the album, and was really looking forward to receiving it. However, I was very disappointed. Not so much in Clay, but in the song selection. In fact, when I have it on, I have noticed so many of the songs sound alike, I have trouble identifying which one he is singing. They don't have the ""inspired"" feel that his voice can deliver. After listening to the album several times now, I'm giving up. I doubt it will hit my CD player again.I hope Clay has a long career and reaches a broad audience base, but in the words of Simon Cowell, ""It didn't do it for me...."""
negative,"Overrated: Give me a break. I do not see what all the fuss is about. I listened to this CD and although Clay sings well, the songs are boring ballads and they all sound the same. I agree with all the negative reviews from the media. This album is nothing to get excited about and I sure wouldn't waste my money on it. You'll get more for you money with Josh Groban's new CD."
positive,"truly AMAZING.: For the first time in my life, I have listened to a CD all the way through (multiple times!) and loved EVERY SINGLE SONG. The album? Clay Aiken's ""Measure of a Man.""Some critics bash Clay for not singing the typical pop song about sex and drugs (although I have to disagree with the sex part... ""Touch"" is pretty hot :D), but honestly, what's so wrong with having MORALS? I think it's awesome and admirable. Everyone can respect Clay for this album, and he really IS making a revolution in the music industry.For the record, I'm 18 years old; I'm a member of that Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera generation. Haha.I highly recommend this album to EVERYONE, Clay fans and Clay hatahs alike. :) It's uplifting and beautiful... very inspiring, emotional, and passionate.HOORAY FOR CLAY!"
positive,It was great!!!: I like it. It was very cool to read about vampires and other legendary cratures of the night.
negative,"Too sketchy: I was eager to read the book after watching the film on BBC2 (England). I expected the novel to be more descriptive, imaginative and more three dimensional than the film but found it to be quite sketchy and without fluidity. It jumped from past to present and from scene to scene quite disjointedly and I found it difficult to continue reading for I felt like I'd read the same paragraph over and over. As a result of this the only characters which seemed to convey themselves as three dimensional were that of Rick and Sheryls'. There didn't seem to be any revelation at the end of the story, I guess with having knowledge of that era that it would be quite obvious in the way things ended, with broken teenage love and little thought for the result of that. Quite disappointing overall, though worth watching the film."
positive,"GOOD FICTION: This movie is great, as long as your not taking it word by word. As far as mystery it has it, Ancient Egypt is something a lot of the world is fascinated by. Though as far as facts this movie lacks (reason for 4 stars) Seti I was not the richest pharaoh, Imopteh was a high priest, Ankhesenamon was the wife of King Tut. I get kind of sick of people thinking that the people's stories were facts. Seperate fiction from fact please."
negative,we were soldiers original motion picture score: i bought this cd for one song on it sgt. mackenzie and i was disappoint that the it was broken up into three parts on the cd
negative,"Self-indulgent: The author has a good sense of humor so there are many funny moments, but in general, there isn't a lot of substance here. Definitely don't pay full price for this one!"
positive,"TOTALLY ENJOYABLE!!: A friend introduced me to the VeggieTales videos for my toddler. Most of my friends think I'm nuts for getting so excited about a ""childrens"" video, but I tell them to watch one and they will see for themselves! ""Dave and the Giant Pickle"" is a must have for your video collection! I can't wait to see the rest of the videos."
negative,"Good movie, not an extended cut: After the extended cuts presented in volumes 1 and 2 of the ultimate edition releases (which are indeed the only reasons I began collecting the ultimate editions), volumes three to six are incredibly disappointing. If you do not own the films, or do not own them on blu-ray, the ultimate editions may be worth purchasing and for this I am giving it an extra star beyond the first. However, the precedent set in the first 2 releases leaves this one so incredibly disappointing that I feel I was cheated out of my money when I ordered volumes 3-6 to watch before the DH2 premiere."
negative,"gene hates jezebel: i love JLJ but this compilation is so so, poor songs selections, who needs demo and bad alternate take anyway, avoid, only for die hard fan."
negative,"Don't Be Fooled By the Title of This Book: The only economic lessons in it are a very biased critique of any economic policy other than capitalist doctrine. I wanted to learn about economics and was so disappointed in this outdated, one-sided book."
negative,"three to four stars - depending...: Classic drawing room comedy, period piece. Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character. Each person's name describes how you should feel about each! Charming idea from the 1700's. If you've never had a chance to see one of these comedies, take a look. This is a famous play and well done. Must see for theatre students."
negative,"fair to middlin': I actually liked the first Mummy film....I thought that even tho, yes it was cheesy, it had good special effects, and a decent plot. But the sequel left something to be desired.For some reason I thought the special effects were....worse in this movie. Not sure if the same studio created the effects for both films, but this one looked worse (to me). The Scorpion King (with the Rock's face) looks completely unbelievable.Also, the relationship the two ""parents"" had with the son was laughable (not in a good way). They didn't even act like they loved him, and he was pretty much in danger the whole last half of the movie. Just shoddy acting.If you want to watch a good mummy movie, do yourself a favor and rent the first one."
negative,"Just ok...: I have had these for a little over a year now. The edges are starting to chip off, and they have been stained a little. They are ok, but not wonderful. I feel like for a Kitchen Aid product, they should be much better."
positive,"ligh from heaven: Last in a series. Each book wonderful! Jan Karon's writing is down to earth, develops characters well, describes places of events. I am happy to have read & given as gifts."
positive,great for kids and seniors: I bought these for myself because I have arthritis and it makes card playing much easier and more enjoyable. My elderly father also uses them. They're sturdy and stand by themselves.
negative,"sophisticated metal: . . . musically at least. Sometimes I just can't get behind a group or album that has merit because something stupid or irritating sticks out like a sore thumb. Thus I will never give Travis, Mr. Big, Mr. Mister or Uncle Kracker a chance because I don't want such stupid band names in my collection. I almost rejected Korn outright because of their lame name. Gee, might as well call your band ""Carrots"" or ""Broccholi.""SOAD can rock, no question. Some of their earlier stuff is good, well mostly the insane-sounding ""Sugar"" is great. But this album has such gratingly, embarrassingly bad lyrics I have to turn it off.""Life is a waterfall/ We drink from the river/ Then turn around and build up the wall?"" . . . ""Always wanna win but you never wanna lose?"" - DUH!!!!Sorry, this music is for pinheads."
positive,"i love it: this game is worth it, so much content and make sure you have a memory pak because the passwords are massive."
positive,"Making the invisible visible: Devlin truly makes the 'invisible' 'visible' in his excellent treatment of the field of mathematics. Each chapter is a masterpiece in itself and supports Devlin's theses regarding the nature of mathematics: mathematics as the study of the patterns of number and counting; of motion; of reasoning; of chance; and of closeness and position. Perhaps read this book after reading Hardy's short essay, ""A Mathematician's Apology"", in order to fully appreciate the beauty involved."
positive,"Presents ideas that my biology professor cannot refute: The books is an excellent starting point for understanding the creation vs. evolution debate. Not like evolutionists, Refuting Evolution explains the ways in which evolutions present their ideas according to their a priori interpretation. Well backed up with facts. I was constantly amazed at how well and clearly the book present its ideas and their supporting facts. A must read for everyone who takes any course containing evolutionary support. Follow reading this book with Refuting Evolution II.Check out their website: www.answersingenesis.org"
negative,"I hated this movie!: Many people have always told me that I sould see the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Everyone always said it was a horrifying film. A few days ago, I saw on the TV guide that the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was going to be on at midnight on channel IFC, so it wasn't cut out. I was excited that I was going to see it,thinking I was going to be scared out of my wits. I stayed up from midnight till two in the morning to watch this and I was so agrivated. I absolutely hated it! It didn't scare me at all. Many people enjoy this movie, but in my opinion, you should never buy it! If you really want to see it, you should rent it first and if you like it, then buy it."
negative,"Uuugghhhh: Let me start off by saying, maybe my review of this book is not fair- I have, so far, only read about 40% of it and was SO disgustingly BORED that I stopped & went on to another book.My first Jane Austen book that I read was Pride & Prejudice- I LOVED that book! I was very excited to start this book, hoping I would love it just as much as P&P...; but I have the exact oposite feeling about it. I was bored in the begining, but I forced myself to keep reading thinking that it would get better. Finally I just couldn't stand it & moved to another book. After reading so many good reviews on here, I will try to read it again- hopefully the 2nd time will be the charm- ?"
negative,"Waste of celluloid: It takes a lot for me to not like a movie, and Rollerball managed to pull it off.I can't decide where it went wrong, or if it just was never right. The whole motorcycle chase thing to the border was unnecessary and seemed wedged into the movie; kinda unnatural. And the fact that the whole sequence was filmed in nightvision was just plain weird. I don't know what gave them that idea. The brief nudity seemed to come out of nowhere and added little to the plot. I had to rewind it to try and understand why on Earth it suddenly happened. The action sequences were ok, but considering what the plot was, it seemed overly dramatic. I work at Blockbuster, and this is one of the few movies that I tell people not to even bother with."
positive,"Can't Get Enough of GLAD's Acapella Projects: Like most things in my life I experienced GLAD in reverse of release dates. I thought it impossible to improve upon Project III and then I experienced Project II. Their variations on Christ the Lord is Risen Today sends cold chills up and down my spine and All Glory Laud and Honor Him makes my heart swell for the praise and worship GLAD offers to millions of Christians worldwide. I'm so very glad I've added GLAD to my music repetoire. ""I say Rejoice, I say again Rejoice"" And, as is my pattern, I will now search, find and experience Project I. Happy Acapella Harmonizing!"
positive,Wonderful Seat: I just love the Cosco High Back Booster. This is the third Cosco High Back Booster seat that I have bought. I used it for both of my daughters and was happy when I found it 6 years later for my son. The straps are very easy to adjust and this feature comes in handy for a perfect fit no matter what my son has on. I also love the cup holder and my son looks so cute and comfortable sitting in it. Thanks for such a great product!
positive,"Excellent analysis of Bateson, Recursion and Ecology: Ecological understanding is a must for all generations. For those with the courage to think through the implications of an ecological world view and want to learn the scientific concepts which help facilitate greater understanding of natural systems, leading to (hopefully) better decisions regarding resource use, this is a great book. By tackling recursion and non-linear causation at multiple time scales and cognitive levels, Harrie-Jones helps enrich the recuriveness of population level learning. Bateson was, NO DOUBT, one of the most challenging thinkers of his generation. Struggling at all times to keep his focus on how to make nature and communication more intelligible to more people so that they would have the tools and wisdom to see the consequences of their action on both other people and the planet. Rigorous and enchanting cognitive medicine for all those working to make a better world."
negative,"Not the most sophisticated writing: I love Jennifer Crusies books, and while this title wasn't a complete waste of my time, it wasn't a keeper either. This story was too simplistic and lacked the marks of a seasoned author. I looked at the copyright and was surprised to see it was recent as I would have thought this was a first effort."
negative,"Reasons why not to read this book:: 1. No plot2. No character3. No originality4. No wit5. No way!I'm surprised Helen Fielding hasn't sued yet. What Fielding did with Bridget Jones is far superior to this obvious knockoff. Emily, the main character here, does little more than spew insights about the previous men in her life. This is not riveting reading, folks. There is none of the sparkling introspection of Bridget Jones, and the fact that Emily has the requisite female friend duo and the gay male sidekick only serves to further diminish the originality of this pale imitation."
negative,if only I could give it a lower rating: I waited almost a year from the first preview of this movie to when it was actually shown on CBC. I was SO excited at first but then as it seemed to be delayed for so long I became concerned that it was not going to live up to my expectations. It turned out to be even worse than I could possibly have imagined. I can't begin to say enough bad things about it; Anne drinking? Anne swearing? Anne flirting with adultery? Any one even remotely involved in the making of this travesty should be ashamed of themselves. As the credits rolled when it finally ended I only wished that I could wake up and find that it had all been some horrible dream and I still had a chance to make it the way it should have been made.
positive,"Doom: Guts, blood, hair flies, and a monster with clear skin is killing everyone around Stonehenge. Oh, sorry if I made you sick. If I didn't, you will be able to read this book DOOM STONE. In the book, a teenager and the gravedigger's daughter try to solve the monster mystery. The teens struggle to find the monster. The British army even goes in with them. They start shooting up the place. The monster is crazy and brutal and will gut you like a fish. If you get sick very easy you shouldn't read this book.I like this book because there is a lot of action, horror, and mystery. You should read this because it is awesome. I really recommend it."
negative,"Bootleg Headband: This headband sucks!! its not the official one. Its too small for my head. Its supposed to be blue, not black. I'm currently using it as a collar for my dog and thats the only cool thing about it. I'm trying to find a real one in time for this costume party im going to. Plz help!"
positive,"A favourite: The characters and emotions in this book are some of Jane Austen's finest works, and I adore this book. I also adore Anne. All the better that I can now picture Rupert as Captain Wentworth whilst I read (I picture my own Anne, however). Oh, when she first sees him look at her like he used to! And, oh, his letter! Just remembering makes me hanker for another re-read! Just so lovely and emotional.If you love romance, this is one of the very best (although I now know to skip the visit to Mrs Smith, at the end, as I don't think it adds anything to the plot)."
negative,TERRIBLY BAD RECORDING: I Love Gloria and thought this was an album featuring both artists together instead u get six tracks of staney then six of Gloria not together at all and all very badly re issued on cd please dont waste your money as I did
negative,"Fun movie, bad Blu-Ray: I should have gone with the DVD. The image quality on this is the worst of any Blu-Ray in my collection. It looks like a DVD, actually. That said, it bogs down my HTPC more than any other Blu-Ray in my collection. It stops, lurches, and the sound gets really out of sync. It also flips out completely for a few frames here and there and displays a randomly colored pixelated image.The movie itself is a good rompin' episode of the sci fi classic. But save your money and get the DVD.UPDATE: I upgraded the firmware on my LG drive and it solved most of the issues with this disc. The lurching/stuttering/syncing problems are gone. It still goes bonkers with the pixelated image from time to time. For the most part, the disc is now watchable. But it's still a very disappointing Blu-Ray."
positive,Perfect: I bought this specifically for making brown rice as I could never get a good texture on a conventional stove -- it's makes wonderful brown rice.
positive,"The Greatest Play on Earth!: I was required to read this play for my ninth grade honors English class. I was expecting it to be a good read, but I found it to be an excellent read! Shakespeare is a true genius. His witty puns and his enthralling details kept me grabbing onto every word. I am a true romantic at heart, and this was a very touching play. The character development and the ironic plot twists are also a very nice touch. If you have never read Shakespeare before, read this and you will be hooked on him forever."
negative,comment on previous user: i think the person who wrote the review from united arab emirates has nothing better to do than to criticize people get a job for heavens sake jesus christ superstar anichak bidoon tufaal
negative,"What's to Love: I read one of Diana Palmer books in the past and didn't particularly care for the hero in the story. I figured I would give her another shot. All 3 of these stories along with the previous one read makes me realize that I can't abide her heroes. If your thing is dealing with extremely mean spirited men who are also whiny as well as bullies, then these stories are definitely for you. It's just disappointing to me that these big, strong, hot mean are such big babies. What a waste of testosterone."
positive,"Great Dance Album: This is a great dance album from 'Moby'. ""Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?"", ""Run On"" and ""Body Rock"" are really cool dance songs. When you listen to this top-selling album, you just want to dance! 'Play' is fantastic. 5 stars."
negative,Another lame mattel product: Please don't waste your money on this one. My four year old son loves the justice league and thinks this toy is pretty great. The problem is the elevator for one never worked and the tower is supposed to be supported by three crappily made narrow suction looking thingys. The minute my son goes to open one of the towers sides the whole damn thing collapses. This happens everytime. I finally just took the three support things off of it and put them away. The gun launcher thingys on top also continue to fall off. Luckily my sons was purchased on sale for only $14 but it's made so cheap and frustrated my son so much that I still feel completely ripped off.
negative,One bad movie: Just when I thought it couldn't get much worse than Revenge of the Fallen...I watch Dark of the Moon. The cheesey (and canned) music score. The overused panning camera shots with a low sun hanging just over the horizon. The also overused helicopter shots. The nonsensical and unending action sequences that leave anyone with a modicum of logic scratching their head in bewilderment (and mild disgust). The inept plot. Shia LaBeouf screaming and overacting. Hot model running around death and destruction in high heels. The endless stream of former A list actors showing up. Etc.This movie is another train wreck. Thank god I streamed it using Prime and didn't pay for it in the theater or on DVD.Ugh.
negative,Lacking a lot for home inspectors: There are a lot of areas that home inspectors need to know that are not mentioned. If you know nothing about inspections then you could learn a few pointers from this book. If you have some knowledge already then there are other books that would be a much better choice than this one. Some areas in the book were wrong. I would read the other books in this field before buying this one.
negative,"Burton the explorer not the actor: Burton,s life was amazing and his adventures were beyond belief so how come I had such a hard time getting thru this book. Because the author can't tell a story. I was very disapointed in the way this author tried to tell about one of histories most interesting lives."
positive,"CHECK THIS OUT!!: Alright, when I first heard Hard-fi on the radio in the u.s. i thought it was another crappy band, but these guys really come though with their new album - Stars of Cctv. I highly suggest picking this one up if you like - The Killers, Oasis and The Bravery among others. It really is a great album featuring the singles - Cash Machine and Tied Up Too Tight which are both great. If you haven't heard of Hard-Fi I suggest you give them a try, it really is worth spending the money for."
positive,"Interesting...very interesting.: It may not have the most complicated, interwoven plot, but what can I say, I like it. Kit fits fits perfectly into the time period without becoming one of those overly sugary ""porceline dolls"" which is what happens to many of the characters in all kinds of historical fiction because the author is not quite sure how the characters of the past should react. It's interesting to watch as Kit tries to fit into her surroundings, but then finds out she can't. She is who she is, and would be who she is. So soon she learns a way out of the suffering of being different but has another problem--her unique character and ""evil"" way of dressing lead the people of her town to believe she's a witch. Now she must rely one the people she trusts most to save her, and hope that some of the people she found hopelessly mistrustful of her would find a way to forgive for being different."
positive,Great Product: The Tivo adapter is so easy. All you have to do is open the package and plug it into your tivo and your ready to go (just make sure you change your tivo settings). Great product
negative,"Dreamcatcher -- A Bad Dream: Stephen King did his best in the days of ""The Stand"" and ""It."" Lately (the past couple of years or so) he's average, at best. Dreamcatcher was disappointing due to its tired ""flashbacks"" and lack of a moving plot. He's still a master of words and sentence structure, but he's lost his old ""exciting plot"" ability. AND, don't even watch any TV or movie programs in which he was a co-producer!"
positive,Sams letter to Jennifer: I've not had a chance to read this book but I don't think I needed any more information than what the seller gave He was terrific
positive,"Kimberla Does It Again: ""Casting the First Stone"" is a book that I would rank in my top ten for the year. Tanya is trying snd praying every day to keep her marriage to Curtis together. She tends to keep it all inside but when things start to affect her child she realizes that she has to get out. This is the story of a strong black woman who's faith in God gets her through some pretty rough times. I can't wait for Ms.roby,s next book"
positive,"Brits and Yanks at war: As others have said, I really like this series more for the depiction of life in a British village during WWII than for the mysteries themselves. There are some very good continuing characters: young girls, bumbling village constables, the American soldiers - plus a right old rip-roaring boo-hiss village harridan whom I love to hate!And of course there are Lady Elizabeth, her faithful household retainers, and the handsome US officer in whose presence Lady E practically gives off sparks, heh, heh...I guessed the solution to the murder pretty early on but still enjoyed the book because I wanted to know what happened to the characters."
negative,"Wasn't what I expected: I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. The item is also like it is made from rubber, but because I needed it for this weekend I don't know what I am going to do at this point."
negative,HATE IT: The cover of this CD is misleading. The songs are not the ones listed. I am very disappointed with this purchase.
negative,Boring: Don't bother wasting your money. This book is slow and goes nowhere fast. I could not even finish the book.
negative,"Went Dead After Only 2 Weeks: I bought this maker online cyber Monday. Got it a little over two weeks ago. Woke up yesterday morning and it was dead...the clock was still showing time on the digital display but the rest was dead. I unpluged it and pluged it back in, then everything was dead including the clock. The package date on the box said 2/2011. Keurig has known about problems with the design of this model for years as evidenced by numerous complaints. No excuse for continuing to put a clearly defective product on the shelf at such a hefty price. I opted to not call Keurig and ask them to send me another. I returned it to the retailer and bought the Cuisinart instead."
positive,"A must have for all Nursing students!: During my very first clinical day of nursing school, I noticed a copy of this text floating around the nursing station. The second I opened it up I said ""WOW!"" Having just recently graduated (and passing the NCLEX!) I can honestly say that this was one of the most helpful books ever! This is Essential! This book never made it to my bookshelf because it was almost always being used! Excellent companion for writing care plans."
negative,"All over the road on acid: I had a problem with this film. The film is based on short stories by Denis Johnson. The movie should have been more shorts with different characters. The flow of it makes you lose characters you grow accustomed to, the drugged out hospital orderly, the AA woman etc, even the Amish women he is involved with in his own way doesn't really evolve the way it should. There are many classic and memorable scenes to enjoy. The ER scene where the two characters get wacked on hospital drugs then have to deal with an emergency is extremely well done. The rest is a mixed bag, shaken not stirred of drug abuse, death and perhaps redumption. I'm sure the book of the same name is a much more valuable purchase."
positive,"A Fine Effort from One of Nanotech SF's Best Writers: I concur with a previous reviewer who finds Nagata's ""Limit of Vision"" to be an inferior repetition of Greg Bear's splendid ""Blood Music"". Although Nagata does an excellent job describing LOVs and the politics of the mid 21st Century, her writing never seems as sharp or as lyrical as Bear's. Still I must commend Nagata for writing a fine debut hardcover novel. Fans of nanotechnological science fiction and hard science fiction will unable embrace Nagata's latest novel."
positive,"Keurig B50 Delivers!: This is an awesome coffee maker. Coffee is consistently good, hot, and fresh. K-cup system brews the perfect cup of coffee or tea every time. Only wish they had hot chocolate. My favorite websites for ordering K-cups are CoffeeCow and CoffeeWhiz. We have one at home, I run a coffee club at work, my mother-in-law has one, and we just bought one as a XMAS present for my brother-in-law. Amazon had some great deals in August with $25 off kitchen appliances and free shipping. It was too good to pass up!"
positive,"Why isn't this guy a household name??????: I first discovered Joseph Arthur a month ago. He was the opening act for R.E.M. They wanted him as their opener so they could see him play live. I figured he has to be pretty good if they like him. First of all he was a one man band. He had a machine that recorded a beat or tune at the beginning then he kept adding to it. He sang and played the guitar along with the songs. It was really good.After doing some research, I come to find out he has four albums out. I just started listening to them, starting with Redemption's son and I think it is a masterpiece. He has a unique quality that is hard to find on any radio station these days. You can listen to it over and overfrom start to finish. Now I wished that I had heard of him before I saw him in concert and I would have appreciated his music a lot more."
positive,"Worked, when others didn't!: Edit* Sorry I wrote this while I was a little excited the first time so let me reword it.Anyways. I had tried many other products to remove a wart that was growing on my thumb in a place that was very noticeable. I couldn't even caress my fiances skin without bothering her with it's roughness. This worked when others didn't. It was funny since I had tried everything from burning the wart off to cutting it off and then burning the wound, so that the wart wouldn't come back. That was after I tried too many over the counter meds that didn't work. This worked for me an it might for you. It's awesome that the wart fell off with this product, after it had regrown back so many times in that same year!PS. I mostly used it 3-4 times a day and covered the spot with duct tape, every time.Be careful though, it looks just like chapstik. Your kids might put this in their mouth thinking it is!"
positive,"Some Details Innaccurate: I agree with all of the others. The Battle of Coral Sea should have been included. There were some errors in actual facts about the battle. In the video, the four Japanese carriers were heavily damaged, while in the actual battle, they, I believe, were sunk. Another, nit picking detail, is in the flick, the Japanese carrier 'Akagi' the island superstructure was like all other aircraft carriers; it was on the starboard side of the ship. In actuality, the Akagi was the one carrier whose superstructure was on the port side.The one criticism about footage from 'Tora Tora Tora' doesn't fly with me. Using that footage and some of the same Japanese actors actually ties the two flicks together."
positive,"The Best Ever: This movie takes me back to the days of being in elementary school and playing transformers on the playground. This movie was moving because it brought some reality to the whole shoot-em-up aspect of transformers. It also started the change in transformers the show. It brought in some characters into places where nobody would've guessed they'd be. It was a dark movie, some points were really dark to a point where you wonder if this was aimed at kids or adults. since i am now technically an adult with the mind of a kid, it doesn't matter....but watch this movie"
positive,Best Boris Karloff movie...period.: As with all the 1930's horror films this one is very atmospheric and even without the special effects of today Karloff in the dual role of Imhotep/Ardeth Bey is masterful. Zita Johann is also quite good as his many times reincarnated love interest Helen Grosvenor. With reference to the classic horror films of the 1930's in my books this one is tied for the #1 spot with the 1931 Dracula. This movie far better showcases the talents of Karloff than Frankenstein.
negative,Cheap Plastic: This toy did not last 1 day. The spring mechanism inside broke after about the 5th game we played. I wouldn't waste my money on it again. We were pretty careful with since it felt cheap right out of the box. After the 5th game the mouth would not stay open anymore.
negative,"A let down: I anxiously awaited Book 5 for several years after reading the first four, all of which I really enjoyed. The story started off ok (more of the same), but included waaaaay too many recaps. I assume most readers have already read the first four books, and probably didn't enjoy this either. The second half (or two-thirds maybe?) of the book were not good. The story was rushed, missing detail and left me wondering if it was even written by Jean Auel, or if she handed it off to someone else to finish it in time for the release. Overall, not worth it. Clan of the Cave Bears will always be the best."
positive,"What, no listing of the content?: Essential reading for a PKD fan and someone who wants to see where the ideas for some of Hollywood's recent films came from. Some of these have way different endings and only somewhat resemble the films for which they're credited as the genesis.What I would like to see here is a LIST of what is actually in this collection. Amazon's information has nothing."
negative,"Brain Based Learning: The New Paradigm of Teaching: I am currently reading the Kindle version of this book. The book itself is very easy to read and full of material to try in the class room. Unfortunately, there are no page numbers that correspond to the paper version of the book. As this is a text book, it is impossible to cite material and the page from which it was taken. This is really unacceptable for a text book. It is one thing if it were a literature book, and even then, it would be better to have the physical page number of the actual book. If I had known that there were no page numbers contained in this Kindle version, I would NOT have purchased it. I would have purchased a used hard copy."
positive,"WOW!: Thank you, Clay Aiken, and it's about time. Your voice is a rhapsody in a world of tone-deaf producers. Every song in ""Measure of a Man"" has a wonderful touch of newness. The sound is fantastic. My personal favorites are ""I Will Carry You,"" a musical accomplishment spiked with Clay's soft tone, ""I Survived You,"" a blend of complex words and a nifty tune, ""When You Say You Love Me,"" a catchy, bouncy melody, and ""Invisible,"" a yearning yet upbeat piece that constantly runs in my head. I am very happy with this buy, excited about the next, and maybe someday hearing Mr. Clay Aiken record his wonderful range and style with a full orchestra background."
negative,"quiet but not efficient: We were trying to replace our old bagged hoover with this bagless model. The model looks cool, easy to assemble, and quiet. We were using it on the carpet and the results were far from satisfactory. Big dirt is picked up, but small dirt requires several runs on the same spot. A low-height setting will pull the carpet and make it difficult to move the vacuum cleaner. The old one which we wanted to throw away was doing a better job than this new one in swallowing small dirt particles, so we ended up returning this to the store. I am not sure if the model has less vacuum power or limited to just the piece I got."
negative,"so many good music out there, why wasting our time and money: As somebody else wrote earlier, it is so much great music out there that these I.Com tracks sound awfully poor and dry to me; maybe if that album would have appeared in the 90s it'd have sounded slightly more surprising, but just a few weeks before Björk releases Medulla, and definitely late after the Chicks on Speed albums (and without even 10% of their musical imagination) Miss Kittin with her new release is making electronic music sound like a joke, and conceived for people who never heard about Warp, Rephlex and the intelligent vast worlds of true electronica. To avoid."
negative,"sized a little small: I generally wear a 38x30, and that's what I bought in these, they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste. I'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in, but you may want to get a waste size up. I'll be wearing them in a dress office setting, and I'm surprised how good these look, hopefully they last a long time too."
positive,"A decent book, I see somwhat related to 1984: It's a book that basically tells of censorship. It is well written and makes you think about censorship today."
negative,"unusable: This book was printed in response to my order,i.e., on demand, and the type chosen was so small I did not even attempt to read it. There were no illustrations.I subsequently bought a used copy of the paperback edition which included a brilliant preface, the illustrations, and an exponentially easier format.I threw away the copy purchased from Amazon.Probably my only truly disappointing encounter with Amazon."
positive,"If your are late 20's or early 30's you remember!: I have read the newer reviews, & kids these days just do not appreciate the good ""older movies"". I can remember watching thismovie OVER & OVER & OVER again years ago. It is one of the best""younger age"" movies of it's time. Movies now have changed (for the worse in my opinion), & in it's day, this movie was extraordinary. Endless Love is & will always be part of my video collection...A classic in it's time...I can only hope I'll get it on DVD one of these days (please release it!!!!).It's worth every penny in my book!"
negative,too many cards: 200 cards? hehehe ok forget about that. the book i dont like it. each card has nice shell picture on it but thats it i cant use this things at all its so confusing and did not helped me in anything.
negative,"Fabulous idea, poor execution: This clipboard was a great idea, and it worked excellent (for a while). Unfortunately, the materials are just not up to the task. The plastic liner on the inside of the clipboard breaks after just a few days of folding and unfolding. That was not too big of a deal, as I just trimmed it with a scalpel. However, and hinge is also pretty flimsy. So after a few weeks, it broke as well. Now all that I have is two chunks of metal that used to be a clipboard.They do have a good warrantee, however. They did replace my broken clipboard in short order. The plastic liner on the new one again only lasted a couple of days, but the hinge is so far holding up well."
positive,A real treasure: I loved this book. It really makes you think about the underlying motives and loyalties that exist in people. Alice Munro examines the everyday sort of person who must make certain choices and live with it. In reading this book I found myself asking questions and feeling slightly disturbed by my lack of certainty on many issues this book addresses. I love the way she uses language and her use of detail is superb. It will make you think and wonder and imagine all at the same time. What a wonderful writer she is!
positive,"Great service from fastfriendlyservice: I am very glad and so impressive from the services from fastfriendlyservice.I ordered a NETGEAR WG111 Wireless USB 2.0 Adapter (54 Mbps) sometime last Dec through Amazon. However, I did not receive the shipment even though the record from USPS showed home delivery. This matter remained a mystery for the reason why USPS delivered but I did not receive.I tried but not much hope to resolve this issue since the seller did ship the adapter. Because of that, it is not the seller's responsibility. However, the seller ""fastfriendlyservice"" sent me emails and saying would like to ship me a replacement. I received the adapter yesterday.I highly applause the services from fastfriendlyservice because of their handling customer issues with professional attitude and trust. Although adapter is a small order, but my on-line ordering with fastfriendlyservice gave me very pleasant experience."
positive,Love it: I bought this when I got sick of the steaming basket breaking. I hd to use it every other day to steam veggies to make baby food. This really does the trick. Worth the money. Easy to use. Ease to clean. Best way to steam.
negative,Problem: A great gps when it works. Stopped working three weeks after receiving. Received a replacement that only worked for a week.
negative,"no!!!!: iguess you have to be stoned to enjoy this moviebecause any other way its just bad its just not interesting ,not funny, not worth it"
negative,"April Morning: April Morning was a difficult book to read. If you skipped a few pages, then you would be completely off track. If you are looking for a book to tell you how life was during the struggling times of the Revolutionary War. You might be better of reading this book. I dont think that the ending really ties the book up. It is basically about this boy Adam Cooper who lives with his parents, grandmom, and his younger brother, Levi. He wants to go to war with his father and while he is there something upseting happens to him. He learns to live through it and he comes home from the war to his family alive."
negative,"Very loud!: This pump works but it's pretty loud. It comes with a second layer of rubber bushings and a second spacer plate but that doesn't do it any good. It's just too loud for my quiet living room. I'd rather hear my overflow than that loud buzzing sound from the pump. Get the Rio+ line, they are quiet."
negative,yo these white boys is wack!: that little country remake of Boyz N Tha Hood was junk yo. they didnt even take out the 'N' word yo! wasup! half the teeny boppers who listen to that punkass remake of the song don't even know about half the stuff theyre talkin about in the song yo! bunch punkass white boys yo
negative,"Stan, Astrud and Joao go their seperate ways: According to ""Stan Getz - a life in Jazz"", Stan had broken up with Astrud after an affair that wrecked her marriage to Joao Gilberto.None of them was speaking to the others. Each got up on stage with a different backup band, mostly they don't play together. Like oil and water. The result is mediocre. A major disappointment after the perfect synchrony and intimacy of ""Getz/Gilberto"". For completists.""Jazz Samba 2"" is a much better followup."
positive,"Excellent: One of the best parts of Season 3, besides just being NCIS is that they put CC on the DVD's. I am hearing impaired and the CC greatly increases my enjoyment of the show."
negative,"monstrously overrated..: what the hell is it with americans? why cant they like GOOD music?> this band is awful, theres only one good song on this and that's the anthemic live forever, which is about the closest they got to a decent tune. every other song is idiotic, bash you over the head with a repeated riff rock that shouldn't ever be compared to the beatles EVER. the gallagher brothers are crap, in their attitude, their look and their songs. this is crappp. morning glory is a good album i admit, and that will be the only reason people care about them,,,,accept and move on"
negative,"what were they thinking?!: oh... my... God! this movie totally screwed the whole HALLOWEEN series! what the heck was Carpenter thinking?! why would he want to screw his rep as a once admired director for this! did michael want to take a year off or something? spend halloween with the wife and kids?, i mean, come on! a word to the wise: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU HAVE A REDICULOUS AMMOUNT OF BOOZE IN YOUR SYSTEM!"
negative,"This is a piece of junk: Based on the reviews I had read, I had high expectations for this toy and thought it would be perfect for my daughter's 3-year birthday. She loves to play hide and seek, build houses and crawl through tunnels. However, it turns out the play tent is a piece of junk. Even the lightest breeze will tip it over. Needless to say it can't handle a child crawling through it without getting all messed up. To say it's flimsy is an understatement.At her birthday party, not one of the 10 kids paid any attention to it (says it all, doesn't it?) until the very end when my daughter and another girl entered - and the tent tipped over immediately.I'm kicking myself for discarding the box because otherwise I would have returned it as fast as I possibly could. A huge waste of money!"
negative,"Need more pictures/better description!: I ordered this hat for my son, who had been looking for one that WASN'T adjustable in the back like a baseball cap. Well, because of the description, I thought this was the correct hat. The description did say ""the real McCoy""! It is adjustable. VERY DISAPPOINTED.But the shipping was extremely fast. And I really like the fact that it's made in the USA! Fortunately, my son liked the hat anyway, and decided to keep it. Hat appears to be very well made, and it looks pretty good in spite of the plastic adjustable strap in the back."
positive,MORE MORE MORE: With so many untalented people making music it makes me sad that this CD and singer haven't been acknowledged as they deserve to be.
positive,"I enjoyed it, but -: I enjoyed the novel, but Kyla's behavior became very frustrating after a while. Her undying love for her 1st husband was beautiful, but even after poor Trevor managed to marry her, it was about a month before she'd get close to him. And after he slavishly did all she could dream of, she still said some really wretched, ugly things to him when she found out the truth (which of course she does). Personally, I'm dying to find out what happens to Babs. Is there any hope Sandra Brown will write a story about Babs, a woman who is not strictly chaste like all of Brown's heroines, but still has a wonderfyul heart?"
negative,"over rated: american idol is over rated, clay aikien is over rated, ruben studdard is over rated, the only good thing to come out of american idol is kelly clarkson, this album is crap, i hate to say it but its true, and hes turning into a diva. i got to admit he can sing better than justin timberlake and usher and all those other crap pop singers, but i just dont get why people like this dude. what kind of song is invisible anyway? i couldnt help but laugh hysterically when i first heard that song, it just doesnt seem to be him. if he sticks to more josh groban type of music, maybe i would like him better....the operea stlye would fit him pretty good. i dont mean to offend his fans, but truth hurts"
positive,Works great and does the job!: I bought this warmer hoping it would get hotter than a candle warmer and it does. Keeps coffee perfectly hot. I highly recommend it.
negative,"Narrator destroys the greatest book !: The John Carter of Mars series of books, by my favorite author of all time, Edgar Rice Burroughs, is his best series.I was so excited to receive the audio version of this book, but when I listened to it, I was hoorified !John Carter sounded like a wimp. A girly Southerner, not at all the swashbuckling hero I envisioned.Now, maybe I'm spoiled by the narrators of other books, but even the weakest, most boring readings have not turned me off in the way that John Bolen has.Please Tantor audio, get some one else to read this, and make sure it is a Manly-Man !!"
negative,"Why, why, why?: This movie absolutely bit the big green weenie. If I have to listen to that jingle one more time...."
negative,"Amazing, but hopeless: I thought this was a horrible book.It is beautifully written, easy to read, and even real, to a certain extent. You only need to flip through a history book to see the horrible things people have done to other people. But to read about twelve year old boys killing each other is really sick. And that's what it is: a bunch of young boys are stuck on an island, they start off somewhat organized, and then, one by one, turn savage.My best friend recommended it to me, saying the ending was amazing. Perhaps it is. It is a sudden let down from the tension. Yes, I agree, it is amazingly written, but it is also hopeless. What life is left for the boys? They'll need a lot of visits to the shrink, I expect.But that's not what it's about. We are not supposed to think of the long term, only be aware of the depravity of the human race. Anyway, that's what I got out of it. And I am glad I read it - if only to say that I read it and now sort of know what the fuss is all about."
positive,"Great: Works great. Got this one to upgrade from a normal/low definition unit. It is compact, easy to use, stylish and is a fine product from Tivo."
negative,"Confusing and Convoluted: As a sophomore in high school nearly 10 years ago, I had a terrible experience with this book. The plot was confusing and complicated by tough vocabulary and grammar. In the version I had borrowed from the school, the ""long sentence"" was (I'm pretty sure) around 7 pages (5x7 size pages).Recently, I tried to pick it up again, convinced by my wife, who had liked reading Faulkner. I found it only slightly easier, with no real improvement. I believe that the problem stems from something that Douglas Adams had once said: ""I'm trying to be literate, not literary."" I get the feeling that Faulkner was trying to create literature as an artform, rather than try to convey his story to the masses.I can appreciate that many people love this story, and that it is a literary masterpiece, but I cannot say that I think it is good."
negative,"Perhaps I missed something: I'm not sure I heard the same CD the other Amazon.com reviewers heard. No swing, no pop, no fun, from my POV. I'm going to see what I can do to get my money back on this one; as a last resort, there's always the used CD store that might buy it from me, or else I can add it to my stack of coasters. The best thing this CD can do for me now is prevent unsightly water spots on my side table."
positive,"This CD is Amazing!: If you want a sample of what the Be Bop Deluxe was all about, this is the CD to get. Interestingly enough, Bill Nelson has been actively releasing CD since the Be Bop Deluxe called it quits.I am a fan of many of the 70's UK rock bands (T. Rex, Bowie, Cocknet Rebel to name a few) and had heard of the Be Bop Deluxe and Bill Nelson, but never sought out their recordings until now. This my first sample of the group's output. I'm amazed at what I missed out on: Great guitar playing, sonic soundscapes, and wonderful lyrical imagry. I found every song on the CD enjoyable and will be seeking out the band's outher CDs to fill in the gaps this complilation doesn't cover.This album brings you the highlights from ""Axe Victim,"" ""Futurama,"" ""Sunburst Finish,"" ""Live in the Air Age,"" ""Modern Times,"" and ""Drastic Plastic""."
positive,"It will send chills up your spine!: Have you ever been peeing and you get that weird chill that goes up your spine? That's how it was listening to this album, but in a good way. A wide range of musical influences is apparent on this album, ranging from folk, rock, latin, to improvisational. There is even an awesome ragtime track called, ""Dill Pickle Rag."" But despite this wide range of styles, the things that remain constant are the great original melodies and the solid musicianship. Catch this St. Louis-based band if you can!"
positive,"Just Frickin' Swell: I believe the best thing about this CD is it's diversity, there's Funky, there's Cajun, Rock, Rockabilly, Blues, Covers, Big Band sounds and of course a good baseline throughout also some nice piano and horn work. I usually have a favorite CD du jour but this one lasted a week! I'm listening to it as I type.You can't go wrong here. I hesitate to rate things a 5 but I think it is."
positive,"Who's telling the truth? I still don't know.: I'm an I-banker and former CPA. I read this book and still can't tell who's right. More than likely as with most arguments, the truth is somewhere in the middle.Jett builds a great case of his bosses setting him up but when someone works this hard at it, I become very suspicious. He does have some very creditable points that his bosses knew or should have known what his accounting practices were. Employee of the year to criminal? Where was internal audit?Basically, this book allows you to hear one side of the story for you to draw your opinions from. I'm not sure what is correct but I enjoyed the read and see one more time the ""ego filled"" life of Wall Streeters."
negative,"Con artist: It's actually a zero star. In product details, it says it has English subtitles. And even on the back of DVD case, it says both The Butterfly Effect and The Butterfly Effect 2 have English subtitles. In reality, the former doesn't provide the subtitles. New Line Home Video studio just conned me, other customers, and sellers. I'll have to return it."
positive,"Accessible Early American Setting: I remember seeing this book title in the YA section of the library when I was young, though I didn't read it at that time. I now teach Early American Literature, and I really appreciate these books that give my students a sense of place. We've been using Kathleen Kent's The Heretic's Daughter, but The Witch of Blackbird Pond tells just about the same story with more accessible content. It's certainly just as appropriate for adults as for young people.The story moves at a quick pace and gives a realistic sense of setting. It covers themes from the time period such as religious intolerance, hypocrisy, the slave debate, fear of outsiders.I highly recommend this reading for anyone interested in late 1600s Early America. Read it on your way to visit historic Salem, Mass."
negative,"Uncomfortable, awkward, noise cancelling just OK: I purchased these headphones as a replacement for my Etymotic ER4 earbuds, which were a replacement for my Sony MDR-NC10 earbuds. Unfortunately, I found them much less comfortable than either the Etymotic or the Sony earbuds and no better at noise canceling.I have used headphones two hours every day for the past twelve years during my train commute. I have been through a long succession of iPods and portable FM radios. I have had a lot of time (too much really) to develop an opinion. I am sticking with the Etymotic earbuds.BTW, the Sony earbuds were great, but if you lose one of the rubber earpieces (like I did - twice) Sony dings you for about $40 for a replacement."
negative,"Spiderman 2 is like a woman soap opera: BORING! The first spiderman in the best. I just saw part 3 and I didn't think it was all that bad.But part 2 just makes no sense. Such a cliche....poor parker doesn't want to be a good guy anymore and live a lonely life. He wants to be normal. Come on. You have to give me better than that.And the Doc Oc character was pathetic. You need to have a ""bad"" guy people actually care about. You never got to knew anything about him. No development. BORING character.The reason Spiderman 1 is clearly the best is because of the Green Goblin. By far the best character/actor in the series. You believed in the Goblin character and I actually was rooting for him. lolBrilliant acting job!So all you spiderman 2 lovers. Just go watch general hospital or some other cheesy soap opera. Same thing."
negative,"this book is a bad joke: This book states was obviously writen by someone who never managed anything in entire life. To sum up the entire book, he believes solely in hands a off management. Unfortunately, this is not realistic and anyone who has managed a sales force understands their sales professionals' need for constant feedback, goals, etc."
positive,"Great but...: ...like a previous reviewer said, I don't know how to beat the shocker on level six so I am stuck! However, before that the game was really fun. I am now searching the internet for tips on beatig him. It's REALLY frustrating, that's why I only gave four stars."
positive,"Absolutely beautiful: Tisto is a true visionary when it comes to trance music, and he is fast becoming a legend. He has a great talent for mixing and putting together CD's, and each new album is like another chapter to his ever-growing collection. In Search of Sunrise 4 is no exception, and it is a true work of art that is not to be overlooked by Tisto fans or any trance fans. From beginning to end on each disc, it's like listening to his past albums, and yet it has a sound all its own. That's Tito's talent, and that's why he's the #1 DJ in the world. My only problem with this album is the remake of his song ""UR"" featuring Matt Hales from Aqualung. If you listen to Tisto's 'Just Be' album, the original mix of ""UR"" is much better in my opinion. On this album, it's much faster-paced and it doesn't have the same melancholy sound as the original. Aside from that, this album is pure gold, and it's a must-have for anybody even remotely interested in Tisto."
positive,Tess of the D'Urbervilles: Once again an excellant service from Amazon. The book is just as I expected. A good quality paper back.R.V.Angel.
positive,"Great little square for the price: When I bought this square I considered it a disposable unit that would probably get bent broken or stolen within short order. After checking it against my Starrett and Mitutoyo squares I was surprised to find out that it was very accurate. Surprisingly, it is also pretty durable. While I am not a big fan of the zinc heads on most consumer grade squares, this one is well made, accurately machined and so far, durable. The etched and painted blade is easy to read although not as easy as the Starrett or Mitutoyo ""satin chrome"". Granted, you can buy 8 of these squares for the price of one of the Starrett or Mitutoyo units.While I would never consider replacing my 6"" Mitutoyo square with this one I will not hesitate to run out and buy another, or two or three Swanson squares when my current one finally does get bent or disappears.Overall, I would give this square five stars for value and four stars for quality."
negative,"*1/2 stars: I didn't care much for Clay on AI (or Ruben, for that matter), but I got the CD anyway since he has a really good voice. Well, there are a couple good songs on this CD, such as ""Invisible"", although some of the lyrics are weird (""if I was invisible then I could just watch you in your room""), ""No More Sad Songs"", and the chorus to ""I survived you"". Overall, though, I didn't really care for the CD. If you were a fan of him on the show, you'll definitely like this album."
positive,Battery Charger: I really like this battery charger. I have used it numerous times and have had no problem with it. I find it is also not a major inconvenience to take along when I go camping to charge my camper battery. Love it!
positive,"A story of the mountain and the dream: I just recently got done reading this book that I picked up on a trip to the mountain. There is still so much left to see, and i have been down there five times already. The history is rich, and very informative. It is a shame that politics got involved and that the original dream was not able to be fullfilled, but alas we got something"
positive,"Best Mummy Movie Ever!: This movie is the best ancient Egyptian mummy movie I have ever seen! I love the visual effects and the sound quality all wrapped up together with the special features. The movie is soooooo much better than the original mummy. The scarabs might creep you out a bit, it did that to me, but you'll really enjoy an airplane scene. The Mummy is the best movie to watch for DVD!"
negative,"Crest Doesn't Live Up To Its Guarantee: These white strips didn't do a darn thing for me, not even a tiny bit whiter. What really galls me is the ""guarantee or your money back"". I sent in my receipt along with the bar code, just as instructed, and never received anything back - this was 5 months ago."
negative,Just use Cascade: I couldn't find this locally and thought it was pretty pricey if ordered through Amazon. So I just followed another commenter's suggestion and used two tablespoons of Cascade powder dishwasher detergent. It worked great. My percolator is bright and shiny.
positive,"A testament to all of the Guy Montags out there.....: This book is a classic on censorship. It also probes at human values and is almost existential in Guy's conflict over the wrong he feels is being committed in the burning of the books. This could even be a chapter out of Huxley's ""Brave New World"" in that the public is conditioned by what they can and cannot read through censorship. An essential for anyone."
positive,"A good read: Having seen The Lord of the Rings movie and being a little confused by it, I was determined to read The Hobbit before the movie came out. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and am now looking forward to the Movie which I am sure I am going to enjoy."
positive,"Such Great Music!: It took me forever to finally get this gem, but it was so worth the wait. Some of the best music I've ever heard. They had it all! Wouldn't it be great for them to get together again?! I just wonder if they really know just how good they were and how much they are missed."
positive,"Religion in America: The usual series format is followed with pro and con positions on such controversial issues as: Is America a religious or a secular nation? What was the intent of the Founders regarding religion? What effect should or does religion have on American society? Does Christian fundamentalism threaten our freedom? What should be the role of religion in the public schools? Should religious doctrine influence decisions about abortion and traditional marriage? Materials chosen from periodical articles, speeches, and essays covering the entire spectrum from the far right to the liberal left make up the contents. Contact organizations, a bibliography, and index are included as is usual for this series. Even if the 2001 edition is owned, this balanced work should be considered because of the extremely up-to-date information on some very divisive issues that it provides. For teenage readers and adults.Reviewed by Robert A. Silver"
negative,"Great coverage...lousy quality: The NBC coverage offered in these videos is fascinating to watch as it shows a tragic, unfolding event as it was covered live in 1963. NBC's coverage was in black and white, except for brief segments early on from WBAP-TV in Fort Worth. The only problem with the videos is the actual video quality...which is lousy. THIS VIDEO IS NOT AN OFFICIAL NBC RELEASE. THE MATERIAL DID NOT ORIGINATE DIRECTLY FROM THE NBC NEWS ARCHIVES. IT IS A BOOTLEG. NBC only released one such video of its JFK coverage, a capsulized version back in 1988 which contains almost none of the coverage seen in this collection. This material is of marginal quality at best...and looks like it ewas copied about eight times before being released in this version. If you're not concerned about this, then you will find it very interesting to watch."
positive,"Not for 8 and up, more like 11: As you can tell from all of the glowing reviews, with which I generally agree, this book has a lot going for it. I would add the following.It takes a little while to get up to speed on how time works in this world, even with the helpful exposition provided by two friendly wizards. You really have to understand how alternate universes work in this book in order to follow the plot and appreciate the action. That's fine, and the way it all works is very satisfying. However, I think it would be very challenging and probably frustrating for the 8 or 9 year old that the publisher claims this book is aimed toward. I'm thinking more like 11 years old, and probably after having been introduced to some other sci-fi quest books first."
positive,"Memory Builder: Great, fun game and educational as well. And the characters hold a young child's attention so that they don't lose interest."
positive,"Transformers the Movie: More then meets the eye!: Being a fan of the original series and of the Beast Wars and newest Beast Machines (as much as they do not even come close to comparison with the original). I have loved this movie ever since it came out. The voices just rock, the soundtrack even more so. Plus just being able to hear Orsen Wells and Leonard Nemoy as Unicron and Ultra Magus just is mind boggling! A favorite amongst the true fans, this has it all. An epic tale of classic Good VS. Evil and a horrific evil(Unicron) that must be overcome by great good(can't say who...give away the ending). Plus, where else can you see a beginning of a movie where a giant planet destroys another world! NO WHERE! That's why Transformers ROCK!"
negative,"A bit too sappy for me: Though the book was well researched, it was a little sappy. The characters were quite one dimensional and the four women in the book were devoid of personality. It's hard to believe that a woman wrote this book. Where was the suspense? The drama? The free will? Great history lesson though - more children's book than adult novel."
positive,"Excellent Soundtrack: I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross"
negative,"Good book, bad copy.: My problem isn't with the story, it's with this copy. If the character is reading something, you aren't. Every single time the author says that someone is reading something, it immediately cuts ahead to when they put the document away. For example, the entirety of the Legend of the Baskerville Curse is cut out, the article with the last Sir Baskerville's cause of death is cut out, a letter to the new Sir Baskerville is cut out... the list goes on. I've had to find another copy to fill in the blanks. The book is worth reading, but I'd spend the money to get an edition that actually has the whole story."
negative,"They break.: I stopped using these condoms after using about ten of them. Although they are great when they work, of the ten that I used three of them broke. I have never had another condom break on me."
negative,"Not what they claim to be: We've had these condoms for over a year now... That should tell you enough about how much my wife and I like them. They really don't help with keeping the ""sensations"". My wife hates them and I really have to work to finish at times (and really - I'm not typically a marthon runner when it comes to sex).Some reviews claim these are knock offs....I'm lead to believe them since I've heard great things about this brand elsewhere."
negative,"**JUNK***: Please save yourself some money and if you have this printer..unplug it and throw in trash now before you waste countless hours of your time, ink and expensive paper...jams constantly and hand feeding required..RUN AWAY!!"
negative,"drivel: A complete waste of time and money. I bought this based on a few songs I had heard on the radio. Unfortunately, the songs I liked on the radio were not on the album. Aparently the good versions are on the b-sides and remixes. You might want to look there first.I've only been able bring myself to listen to it a handfull of times. The album has no energy, no spark. None of the songs had that ""play it again"" interest. Several of the songs were of the ""let's not go there again"" variety.I bought other albums at the same time and they are wonderful: Olive 'Trickle', BT 'Movement In Still Life' and Delerium 'Karma'. I can repeat play all day and not get sick of hearing them."
positive,"Does a good job.: There's nothing wrong with this at all. It does exactly what it's supposed to do, even though it seemed to me to be a little slow. Nevertheless, it's compact, and efficient."
positive,"underrated, and a gem for Danny Kirwan fans: I completely disagree with the previous review on this album , especially the part of Purple Dancer being the worst song Kirwan ever wrote. Purple Dancer is one of the most sought after songs of the early FM era,and even though it is not the original release,it's available only on this set. And maybe it's not perfect,but this release is solid and raw and it captures fleetwood Mac during the Kiln house tour which was short lived , due to Jeremy Spencer's dissapearance from the band to join the children of god. Also I would like to add that it is rare to find any fleetwood mac live recordings between the eras of the band that was after the Peter Green days, and Before the Buckingham , Nicks era. So in my opinion if you are a FM fan of all the eras, you will be glad this is available. Let's just hope it stays available , and maybe there will so some recordings released during the ""Future Games"" or ""Bare Trees"" era."
positive,coming to life: The bible comimg to life is what happens when you read this book and with that you remember it more clearly and can identify with the characters.I can't wait to start on #2. Lynn Austin is remarkable in her writing in that it takes you right to where they are at.
positive,"If you like Douglass, you'll like this: Good stuff from the great freedom fighter. Rarely known texts are included with the famous ""Narrative."" ""The Condition of the Freedmen"", a look at African-Americans 20 years after the end of slavery, provide some sobering thoughts for American Blacks today. ""The Heroic Slave"" tells the little-known true story of Madison Washington, who led a slave ship called ""The Creole"" into freedom in 1841. I would also recommend ""The frederick Doulgass Reader"" and ""The Life and Times of Frederick Doulgass"" to make your ""Dougology"" complete!"
positive,"Great reading and excellent story!: ""Haunted Summer"" is a great book for young teens and adults, too! It is a story of self-examination and confusion that must be exposed for the protagonist to survive a life unrealized. I was very surprised by the circumstances, but can understand why Marilla had a choice to make. Read to see why the story is so fascinating. You will learn a lesson about yourself in the process, too."
positive,"Ok, so I bought it for myself...: I bought the wonders fishbowl when my daughter was about 7 months old. She loved it. She's now 2 1/2 and STILL plays with it. This toy is extremely durable as has past the test of being thrown down the stairs a couple of times. There is a volume switch which is very nice. I guess my only ""complaint"" would be is that I wish I could have the option of having just the bubbly sound and not bubbly and music (they play separately)."
negative,"Five disks, no music!: I was very intrigued to see that RCA was offering a CD changer that played MP3. While RCA received mediocre reviews online, and I couldn't find any reviews of this player in specific, I took a gamble and ordered one. It arrived (single boxed), I unpacked it, and immediately noticed its light (cheap?) plastic construction. Plugged it in, popped in some disks, and ... nothing! It recognized the disks, but would not play them. Amazon graciously agreed to send me another unit second day, and paid for the the original's return. The second unit arrived, this time it would not even accept disks. I was wary of RCA's reputation when I ordered this unit. This experience has buried it for good. A definite do not buy."

positive,"Good price, good image, easy to use: This is my 2nd frame. The first one requires to edit the pictures taken from camera to fill the screen. This one, with a standard resolution of 640x480, you just select a resizing to a 20x25 640 pixels in Picasa and voilá!!.Cons: Play only MPEG videos.

negative,"Nice material, sizes are inconsistant: I ordered a black and a navy XXL shirt.The black was slightly larger than a normal XXL, but is wearable.The navy XXL chest size measures approximately 62 - 64 !!!This is larger than many 4XL shirts I have seen. And is no where close to the generic sizing chart that Amazon provides.For both shirts to be from the same manufactuer and line and to be completely different in size makes me leary to purchase clothes from this manufactuer again."
positive,"I'm all bristles over it: Finally, a nylon brush for my pro shop 1911. I feel much more relaxed knowing that nylon is softer than stainless steel and won't cause any wear inside my barrel. I know they claim the bronze is soft enough also but this does just a good as job with no risk. Especially good if you shoot a lot and do frequent cleanings. Cabelas has been sold out of these for about a year and I was glad to get one from Amazon."
negative,"Oil Field Chemicals misses the mark: The book ""Oil Field Chemicals"" is limited to superficial generalizations and lists of chemicals without a critical review or insights into chemical interactions. It is a diappointment to anyone looking for an in-depth coverage of oilfield chemicals."
negative,"Worst Advice Book in History: This is, without question, the WORST book ever written on one's financial life. To begin with, it's useless: ZERO information, ZERO new analysis of old information, ZERO advice, ZERO interesting anecdotes. Additionally, it's rambling--meandering from summaries of old data, to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel-good blathering. What exactly is this guy's point? No way to tell.Seriously, this book is SO BAD that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have, in my opinion, lost all remaining credibility.What a waste of my $16 and 4 hours.I want my money and time back."
positive,"Long Overdue: This is a pioneering work, the first history of the Neo-Pagan movement which (note Mr. Hutton himself admits the diffculty of the task)gives a full scholarly review of the Pagan movement, its history and the ideas and cultural background of its tenents. Outstanding!"
negative,"Useful only to geek virgins.: If you dated in high school or if you've ever had sex, this book will teach you nothing. It's like reading a gunnery manual written by pacifists. The ""System"" is boring, trite and useless."
negative,"broken case: I should have listened to the other reviews but thought I would get lucky. Unfortunately I did not... my case was cracked when I took it out of the box. The packaging looked good so I do not understand why it was broken other than maybe it was not taken care of during shipment. In any case (not a pun), the quality of the case is very cheap and since it was broken it revealed being made of cardboard covered with metal paper. It is obvious that the case would not have lasted that long if it was used at all. Also there is only one handle so the weight of the chips alone would start cracking the entire case.Fortunately nothing inside was damaged from what I case see, though it is obvious the quality inside the case was just as bad. I will be returning the case and chip set, hopefully not having the same bad luck with my next purchase as the ones I bought."
positive,"Couldn't stop laughing!!!: I love this movie! I worked at a video store during college, and I reccomended this to all kinds of people. It was one of the few movies that everyone could find something to laugh at while watching it. Peter is an average Joe who hates almost everything about his average office job. When his hyptomism goes wrong, he stops caring, and surprisingly does better at work. When his two friends are laid off the three hatch a plan to get some money out of the company, but nothing works out as planned."
negative,"What A Wonderful Cure For Insomnia!: I was forced to read this book in my English class this year, and I almost died. For a more thrilling read, try a dictionary or a phone book."
negative,"Some errors in book - disappointed: The book is okay, but there are some errors. Chapter 7, page 123, says that ""Protein synthesis begins with the transcription process"". This becomes a quiz question at the end of Chapter 7, but according to the quiz key in the book, the answer ""transcription"" is incorrect. Also, quiz question number 1 at the end of Chapter 7 also appears to give an incorrect answer (according to the quiz key). Also, there seem to be more inconsistencies. So I am disappointed. Otherwise, if it weren't for these errors, this could be a great book - a five star instead of a two star."
positive,"Classic Movie! Must Have!: Such a classic movie, this is an absolute MUST have movie for anyone who enjoys Stanley Kubric movies. Outstanding!!The Blu-Ray is even better with the remastering, as well as the special features. Great buy!"
positive,"Hidden gem: If you like Chet, the trumpeter, this disc is a hidden gem. Recorded in Italy in the early '60s, it's got European players on it. Good disc, particularly if you like Chet. If you're just starting out with Chet, try some of his '50s output first, then get with this fine disc."
positive,Robert Palmer is at the top of his game: I love this cd. I saw Robert on this tour and was blown away. He got booked at the Medina which was lame and he even made a supperclub crack. I've seen Robert live twice now and he was dressed to the nines and sang his heart out. Could someone please give this man his props?!!
negative,"Anybody?: IGNORE THE RATING.Does anyone know if this product strips color from your hair? I ordered it, but haven't received or used it, yet. But I plan on getting color soon, so I don't want to use it if it's going to strip it."
negative,"Horrible book with lack of information: This book is the worse book ever. It only has 50 pages to prepare you for the pharmacy technician and the rest are just exams. For those who have pharmacy experience, this book would be okay for you but for those like me who doesn't have any and would like to self-study, then it isn't for you. Honestly, the book is just a complete waste of money. It is only 170 pages or around there while the other books are over 400 pages. The book is also useless in preparing for the exam because I didn't pass by using this book. It does not mention drug interactions or touch on it unlike Del Mar's book. This book is a piece of crap. Do not buy and waste your money. You will not pass the exam if you buy this one because it barely expands on the topic. I recommend Del Mar's book because it has the most pages ever (600 pages.) Best book there. Just don't buy this one."
negative,"Not as good as I'd hoped...: I don't feel it's up to Adams' usual standard, nor as good as ""sniglets""--remember them? I don't like the idea of using existing words--usually proper nouns. More imagination was needed. And I didn't get the illustrations."
positive,"Takes me back to my childhood: This was my favorite album years ago! I found myself singing along, even though it had been long since I had heard them. If you like Marty Robbins, this is his best ballads. I love it!"
negative,"Boring!: I kept waiting for the story to start, but it never did. I hung in there, thinking that eventually something was going to happen. Even when there was a ripple of an event, it was written about in an uninteresting way. No suspence, no intrigue, just a waste of time in my opinion."
positive,Works great: I bought this becasue my opener wasn't working well and thought this would be small and easy to use. It was easy to program and works very well.
negative,"Beware, only Castillian spoken here: This set is fine if you only want to learn Spanish in the Castillian accent. Castillian is a rare accent that you will encounter in certain areas of Spain. No Latin American countries use Castillian! You'd be better off with a different set of software if you truly want to learn the Spanish that most native speakers use."
negative,"Fast orange waterless hand cleaner: I like the product. It gets your hands clean without drying them out. I Bought a box of 6 and whoever packed them for shipping, put the box of six in the shipping box upside down. 3 of the lids came off and the cleaner was all over the inside of the box. I wasn't impressed at all. I wrote to Amazon about their packaging but as of yet haven't got a reply. The cleaner would be worth the price if it was shipped right."
negative,"Very poor quality: The paper used and printing process are the cheapest I've ever seen. If you want to give this this book as a gift, buy it from another publisher. What a major disappointment. Returning it doesn't seem worth it financially but I'm sending it back based on principle."
positive,"Funny story, but barely suspense at all: I think I'm used to seeing Hitchcock suspense movies, not love ones. This one was still nice, but I do wish it had a different air to it. The only action is at the ending, where they must escape a sinking ship.Well, event though it's a love story, I'll review it. Barry and Kendall make this movie very funny, the way they go around dancing and ""playing"" to music. Mixed with some wondeful characters, this is one Hitchcockian movie no one should miss."
positive,"QuickShade Marketplace Screen: This really kept the bugs out during our camping trip. It is a little hard to zip, but well worth the money!"
negative,"50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques: I have a Gateway Computer with Windows XP, 512 ram and 80 GB hard drive. This book is not up-to-date to handle Windows XP because the instructions from each chapter do not allow you to follow the directions. An example: in chapter 1, ""remove a color cast"", I brought up the wedding picture and could not follow the instructions to correct the color cast. This continued with many of the instructions in the ongoing chapters. I believe that the cd rom needs an update for Windows XP."
negative,"Cover was bent itm looked used.: Sent book as an Xmas gift. Book was purchased in NEW condition, however, there was a large crease in the front cover. This is nit what I would call new. Would have bought a used book for less if I had know they would ship a book in poor condition. Xmas was a month ago. Two email complaints have already been sent without response. Do not recommend this company!!!"
positive,"My first Chick Corea Album: As my first introduction to Chick Coreas' music, this album is just so amazing , a really beautiful, unique creation. The Sax playing is particularly inspiring."
negative,"I'm scared... not!: This movie is laughably bad. It's so old, and the picture quality is so unbelievably awful, it's not a scary movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's only scary feature is the fact that it is remembered enough to be released on DVD. My favorite part was the mouse trapped to a machine and then it disappears. It disappears in such a cheesy, horrible way because the film tricks used back in the early 60's were so weak, so it doesn't look believable. Another favorite part was the guy who was supposedly being beat up by an invisible man, but it was really funny because the guy was jumping around pretending he was getting punched and strangled. It's funny! Before anyone accuses me of not being able to appreciate old horror movies, just let me tell you that I've seen other films released from around this time, and they looked a LOT better, and the acting and scary moments were a lot better as well. This is just not a good movie."
negative,"Amazement and Shock: I was bored, amazed and shocked by this movie. I was amazed that this was shown.... and sad at the listlessness in these young people's lives... and at the fact that these kids had nothing doing in their lives. I was laughing at the comparisons of the boys and girls talking. I was shocked at the callousness and indulgency of the rape scene. It still leaves me with anger. What this showed was the lack of respect for women and also every woman's fear of being raped while in such a vunerable space. It was amazing to see the beginnings of such addictive behavior and obvious at the lack of personal time and care in their homes. A very raw movie."
positive,"my review: i read this book, and this is my second favorite book! my first is journey to the center of the earth"
negative,"warning- Very Short Cord: The andis company is very good for hairdryers, yes they tend to have a heavy motor, but thats because they last a long time.This hairdryer was cheap for a reason, I found out after i bought it, the cord is VERY SHORT. I would not recommend it for anyone who needs to move around to a different room to blow dry their hairThe blow dryer was okay for people with straight hair, not curly."
positive,"GREAT BOOK IN EVERY WAY: This is the ultimate book on Bettie Page. This book is for every true Bettie fan. Even contains an introduction from Bettie herself.If you really want to follow the history of legend, this is the ultimate book on Betty Mae Page!"
negative,Hard to read: This was the first book I have ever read by Arthur Conan Doyle. I would not recomend reading the book. I found it very dry and hard to read. He uses textbook-like discription and his 1850's English language conflicts with the 2000's american language. The first 50 pages are rather boring and unimportant to the rest of the story. The book only starts to get some what interesting after that. There wasn't much of a twist in the ending beyond telling you who was responible for the crime. Overall the book is not worth your time.
positive,"Great, but not much is new: Everyone else tells the details, but this really said nothing new and has little that is new. The untold plot had already been told in the movies and this only reenforces it. I personally disappointed with episode 22 with the fact that the music which really made the secene so memorable was dimmed down alot. I'm not saying this dvd is bad, I'm just saying I would think about it a little bit more on how you spend your money."
positive,Best Show Ever!: For those who have not had the privilege of watching this show I highly recommend this DVD! It is my fiance and my favorite show!!!
negative,"Maximum NO Doubt SUXXXX!!!: DON'T BUY! NOT EVEN FOR A PENNY!! I'm a #1 No Doubt fan and this cd totally sucked!! I bought it because I thought I stumbled onto something rare. It has nothing to do with the band, just heresay and nothing at all interesting! an english lady reads it and there's no NO Doubt music at all. It wasn't even written by no doubt and it contains no real info just when their albums came out and what label. I buy EVERYthing that's no doubt and I wouldn't spend a dollar on it!!"
positive,hard to install: It was difficult to install the rear screw because of the location otherwise a great product. No other problems with it
positive,"Her short story about Elvis: My introduction to Ms. Hecht was a short story she wrote titled ""I Want You, I Need You, I Love You."" It's a chronicle of her infatuation with Elvis (often mentioned in ""Do the Windows Open?"") and an alternative riff on Elvis's untimely, undignified death. It was published in the O. Henry Prize Stories of 1978. Find it if you can."
negative,"too expensive: Wow, just put the gun away…this product is way too expensive for the quantity. One can find quality cleaners for half the price."
positive,"Good place to start Web development: It is a great book for all new arrivals to the Web development and design world. The book's title doesn't indicate the real content, it is not just HTML, it is an introduction to web design covering HTML, JavaScript, Client-Programming, Server-Programming, CSS, XML, and many other topics. I recommend it to all beginners but wishing to become experts."
negative,"Disappointed: I paid extra to have the battery expedited to me, because I was leaving the country. Now I am overseas, and my battery is somewhere else. It was also sent to an address that I lived at in 2005, even though I changed that address in Amazon, and got a confirmation that it was changed."
negative,"Don't Waste Your Money on Oggi Coffee Carafes!: This carafe doesn't not keep the coffee hot or even warm for that matter more than an hour or so, and that is only when you preheat it and fill it full of coffee. Otherwise, you will have cold coffee in no time. It is impossible to keep clean even with a bottle brush. It's stainless steel but the bottom is rusting (on the outside) and although its only 3-4 months old the lever in the lid has broken for no apparent reason. Move on to some other brand like Correlle. This one is a wast of money."
negative,"""Flies"" is a mean and flawed book: Golding proceeds from the flawed premise that human beings, if left to themselves, will revert to their animal natures. Obviously it's flawed because otherwise we would never have achieved civilization in the first place. Besides the general degredation of humankind that Golding appears to relish, the book also fails because of its silly, deus-ex-machina ending. In short, about the best thing that one can say about this book is that it's widely read; but then again, so was the Little Red Book."
negative,A classic book sold by weight not content: Many computer books and study guides are sold on the basis that they are huge and - by implication - full of wisdom and knowledge. On closer inspection they turn out to be weak and muddled. This book falls into this category and then some. It is about the worst I've come across. Obviously rushed out to meet some kind of marketing need and consequently packed with errors. I actually came to Amazon to see what others said about it after struggling to understand the logical errors I thought I was coming across. Here's a nice but rather obvious example: p50. Q6. Which of the following acids are polyprotic? Acetic; Sulphuric; Hypochlorous; Nitric; all of the above. Answer: Carbonic! PLEASE! Chemistry is hard enough as it is. Don't make it worse.
negative,"Mildly Disappointing: I found that this cover accumulated water puddles even when tightened, and then started mildewing on the top. A hard plastic cover would be far superior to this. It is hard to put on, hard to remove (without getting water or sand all over yourself). It fades in the sun."
positive,"Brain based Learning: This is a text book I ordered for my classes for teacher certification. This book is very easy to read, and I am really enjoying it. It presents info and then at the end of a section, recaptures the essence of the reading for you. I would suggest it for any teaching class. I am learning so much from this book. I have been buying all my text books from Amazon because they are so much cheaper, and sometimes I can get free shipping. So far, there has not been a book that I could not find here at Amazon."
positive,"Love these diapers: I absolutely love these diapers. I used a big box of Huggies previously and we were cleaning up poopie messes almost daily. My baby has only had about 5 accidents in the past month with these. They do keep him very dry and not soaked if there is a lot of pee. My baby is very chunky and short, so I have to disagree with a previous review that chunky babies do better with Huggies. These are hands down the best diapers I've used so far."
positive,"Great film......if you have a brain that enjoys thinking.: I'm shocked at how many people disliked this film probably because it requires attention and thought throughout from beginning to end and makes more sense upon second viewing. Intensely layered with a very dry, dark, and often bizarre sense of humor, excellent direction and acting with Pierce Brosnan playing a real scumbag, if you know nothing of political history and backdoor manueverings, this film may make no sense to you, but if you feel comatose being subjected to standard Hollywood crap, you may have fun with this. Put on your thinking cap and enjoy some thick intrigue. And some laughs, if you can ""get it."""
positive,"A great book with lots of room for improvements.: I have experiences in many martial arts and had done lots of streetfighting, and I can tell a working technique just by looking at pictures. In this sense, I must say that 75% of Prof. Kirby's moves works well. His armlocks, for example, are more effective than those of Aikido. However, being an experienced groundfighter, I must say that his ground escapes are weak. But it's not his fault. I'm sure he included it just as an afterthought, and GF were not popular by the time he wrote this book. It's very good that he included it on this book, considering that most other Jujitsu teachers omits ground moves on their books."
negative,"Once Is Enough: I'm not familiar with Stanley Kubrick and I wasn't even born yet when this movie came out. All I can say is that this movie was way too long and I had to force myself to continue watching it to the annoying end. There were also way too many phallic images presented throughout the course of film. Just way too many. If you think the government giving a person medication to change bad behavior is controversial, just wait a few years. Soon your DNA will be collected as soon as your out of the womb. Your DNA will be tested to see if you have a ""criminal gene"" and then off you go to a facility to be given a microchip and medication to control you. I saw this movie once and I never want to see it again. Skip this one at all costs."
positive,"OF MING AND MONGO: WE GOT OUR FIRST TELEVISION AROUND 1950. I WAS 8 YEARS OLD. TO ME, THIS FLASH GORDON SERIAL WAS SOMETHING FANTASTIC. I BELIEVE IT WAS ON DAILY ON THE DUMONT CHANNEL. MY FRIENDS AND I WOULD IMAGINE OURSELVES INVOLVED IN THE ACTION. WHAT ELSE WAS THERE? I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SERIES NOW IN 50 YEARS. FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT, IT REALLY SEEMS STILTED AND CONTRIVED. HOWEVER, IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF A MORE INNOCENT TIME WHEN THE VIDEO AND SOUND EFFECTS WERE REALLY THRILLING AND THE ACTING JUST THE BEST! I REALLY, REALLY HATE THAT MING!!!"
negative,"Just OK: I ordered this book because of the good reviews, expecting a great book full of spells.There aren't many spells however, like the cover implies. Instead the author gives his knowledge of herbs, incenses and oils and what each can be used for.Spoken and Written spells seems to give a few spells worth trying, but overall, if you're looking for an actual ""spell book"", this isn't the one unless you like to go herb/incense/oil hunting.I returned the book the next day."
positive,"Pretty cool: Let me first say I'm into HipHop(real Hiphop, slug, Atmosphere, etc). I have latelly been checking out the Euro scene of music(I don't know bought a Bmw could have been influencing me lol). I like this chick(not only cute) but she is cute and beats are catchy. Their music makes wanna make me drive fast. The older I get(30), the more I listen to beat and the complete way the music is put together. So liking the Goldfrapp stuff. So I by these cd's for my girl(while secretly ripping them to my zune). Right now working overtime to go check out Europe and stuff(not better than America, but different obviously the as an European visiting here. Good catchy cd, interesting use of instruments and keyboards. Did I mention she is cute little thing. Check out their videos they are a trip."
positive,"CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!: I can't get enough of this marvelous CD. I have to admit I play it over and over again, every day. It is mesmerizing.To those who say the album does not reflect this singer (i.e., he is not a song writer so he doesn't know squat), I say WHO CARES? How many artists out there today actually write their own songs and have lived every word of them?? To naysayers who do not believe a good singing voice makes an artist, well, I think there are about two million people out there who would tend to disagree with that assumption!!I have news for all of you doubters. This IS real music; music that has been sorely missing from the airwaves for years. So,you'd better get used to it - Clay is here to stay.AND I, FOR ONE, WILL CONTINUE TO BUY HIS MUSIC AS LONG AS HE CHOOSES TO GRACE US WITH HIS REFRESHING STYLE AND MARVELOUS VOCAL ABILITIES!Buy Measure of a Man and see for yourself what REAL SINGING is!"
negative,"not so much a review of the CD: k, I love Clay... he ROCKED on AI2.My only problem is the song ""Invisible""- lyrics: If I were invisible, i would watch you in your room"". STALKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!!! Does anyone else find this song as deeply disturbing as I do? He's got a GREAT voice tho! He just needs to think about the songs he's singing before recording them... I mean seriously..."
positive,"A2000 - Nice: I had no problem in the antenna shipment. It works great! Just stuck it on the roof top, took the car for a spin, looked real important and talked on my CB. A lot of people don't even know what a CB is any more but has many benifits while traveling."
positive,"semi novas: I collect mostly wheat Penny's, if the book is correct my collection has all went up one grade from what i thought. THANKS"
positive,"long awaited and well worth it: I read many reviews of this bool and I don't understand, the only book of the series that I have not read countless times is the first one, CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR. This book was everthing I expected of it. My biggest question is, is everyone reading the same book???????????? I have read SOS twice now and do not find anything out of line with Ms. Auel's writing, just one question will we have to wait so long for book 6?..."
negative,On my 3rd machine in 1 year!: I love my Keurig(s). B70 platinum.....BUT....I've had 3 in the last year. They just don't hold up! Take a look at the following link before you spend hard earned money![...]
positive,"Great Suspense! A Classic Short Story!: Great Book! Keeps you focused and entertained. Classic ending, Climax of the story is thrilling, hits you when you least expected it..Great Plot, Great Character descriptions, you feel in touch with the characters and feel their every emotion! A Must Read! I couldn't stop reading...You TOO will enjoy it!"
negative,This is a great book to put a person to sleep!: This book put me to sleep before I could even finish a chapter. I don't think that it had anything to do with a real persons daily life. Overall I hated the book and it was the most boring book I ever read!!!
positive,One of the best stories of all time!: I love this book! I first saw the most recent movie that was made based on this book and after seeing the movie I needed more. This book has definitely delivered what I was looking for. Theres so much great detail throughout the book. I couldn't wait to see what happened next!
negative,"I guess I got the lemon: This fan *is* very quiet, when I hold it in my hand. However, when I mounted it to my Antec case's internal exhaust tunnel, the thing buzzes like crazy. I think it must be something out of balance, and that the exhaust tunnel serves as an amplifier for the noise. I even bought Antec's ""NoiseKiller"" product, which didn't help a bit.I also have a Zalman fan on the same exhaust tunnel, and it is ultra quiet."
negative,ORIGINAL MUCH BETTER: THE ORIGINIAL OF THIS MOVIE WAS MUCH BETTER. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS IN THIS REMAKE ARE BETTER-BUT THE PLOT IS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL.
negative,"One of the worst albums EVER.: I'm never a nasty person, and I know that on his day Noel Gallagher writes not just classic songs like Cigarettes and Alcohol but whole albums of them like Definitely Maybe. But PLEASE! This was so mind-numbingly awful that by the time I got to the eighth track I wanted to (JOKING!!!!) get that guitar and WRAP IT ROUND HIS NECK! It was that bad. Even the stand-out tracks Stand By Me and Be Here Now are pitiful copies of their earlier songs like Married With Children and Shakermaker. The rest - well.....do you really fancy hearing ""Wonderwall"" twelve times every time you put the album on?If there had been a category lower than one star it would have more accurately described my reaction to this album."
positive,"Spine Tingling Thriller!: Joan plays Myra Hudson, a successful playrite who marries Jack Palance then discovers an awful truth....Now watch Joanie go to work in a very clever way to out fox the villians......It is no surprise to me that Miss Crawford was nominated for an Oscar for this edge of your seat Hitchcockian like thriller...It is a job very well done and Miss Crawford deserves a vivacious round of applause!! ATTA GIRL JOANIE!!!"
positive,"Perfect night: Great trio, great tunes and exceptional performance. You could do without Peterson's grunting and footstomping, but, in a way, they add to the excitement. Ray's solo on How High the Moon should be, as O.P. once stated, capsuled and sent to the moon."
positive,"Wildly entertaining: Mary has such a way with words. Yes, she's got a potty mouth, but she pulls it off better than anyone I've ever seen. Extremely clever lyrics highlight one of my favorite all-time, but way too short, albums. Her next album is on order, I've been waiting a long time. This is a definate MUST SEE show if you are ever in the Maryland area."
positive,"Best diapers we've used so far: No diaper is perfect, that's why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. These are however the best we've used so far (and we've used quite a lot of different brands and types). Fewer blow-outs and seems to hold a lot of pee overnight. Thumbs up :)"
positive,"bluegate fields: it is a typical Anne Perry book but with a twist which I found interesting, as I am an avid reader of her books I like most of her books and how she keeps you interested."
positive,"Has held up well: This flag was given to me as a gift from my wife for fathers day 2010, it is now June of 2011 and the flag is still flying well in front of our home. It has not faded or tattered in any way. Excellent purchase!"
positive,"Was a gift: This was a gift and the recepient was very pleased. Very good quality, expedited shipping, and overall pleased with entire transaction."
positive,"Good Hours: I am very surprised to hear some of the bad reviews of this album. Bowie does another bang up job in my opinion and I found it to be very relevant to my own life and especially in the current state I am in. I find Thursday's Child to be a superior song about a man regaining control of his life - it is very uplifting for me - 'throw me tomorrow seeing my past to let it go now that I really have a chance ...this is a song about a person changing his life around for the better - I love it. Next song I love is Something In The Air, this is a fantastic song that chronicles a break up - a personal relationship that doesn't necessarily have to be with another person -... ""danced with you too long"" - this could be about an addiction. Bowie's voice is excellent - his backup singers and musicians are all first rate - the whole album is excellent - Bowie is a fantastic lyricist. I highly recommend it."
positive,"A Great Reminder: Though I'm sure everyone has heard this story, it is a great reminder of what Christmas should be. Even better this time."
negative,"Uhh... No.: The first three songs are okay, but after that this thing is totally down the drain. Believe me, I LOVE kiss, but the whole record is like ""LOOKING BACK ON DAYS OF GLORY"". Examples : Looking Back it feels all right, Let's make up or break up. I recommend KISS (1974) thru CREATURES OF THE NIGHT (1982). Psycho Circus, I Pledge Allegiance, and Within are OKAY but the rest stink. It's hard to believe that that the same people who made this made LOVE GUN, CREATURES OF THE NIGHT, and ROCK N ROLL OVER."
positive,"A riveting tale of maternal love and personal evolvement.: Ms. Kitt takes us on a poignant and moving journey through her life. She holds no punches as she shares the her humble beginnings and her serendipitous rise and later fall and then majestic rise again in her celebrated life. Her descriptions of places and incidents allow the reader to feel and become a part of her world. She offers us the true meaning of love when she describes her life encounter with her daughter and entrusts us with her non-traditional formula for raising a happy,loving and independent child. Occasionally, her truths are so raw and heartfelt they bring tears to the readers eyes, but her later triumphs make our hearts soar with pride and love. Ms. Kitt is a truly phenomenal woman and one can only hope that she picks up her pen one more time and shares with us what life has been like for her in the newest chapter of her life. A GREAT MUST READ! :)"
negative,"no: Bought this dvd player so that we can watch european dvds, the problem is that the player does not come modified to watch the dvds from UK right away. We sent it back and both it again from a vendor that sells it already modified for only a few bucks more."
positive,The hobbit: I loved reading it. Can't wait for part 2. I think the best part is the ending. I would have never thought of that
negative,"Too fictionalized: If you're looking for a reasonably truthful account of the flamboyant criminal career of Jack ""Legs"" Diamond, my advice would be to skip this book. Sam Curzon, the author, creates characters (such as the nurse, Mary Bogan, with whom Legs supposedly had an affair) who simply never existed, and the dialogue contained in these pages is questionable at best. Certain names, dates and places are factual, but in my view this book contains an unacceptable amount of misinformation, far too much for any serious student of the Gangster Era."
positive,Intex Pillow rest Twin: I ordered this for a friend who was displaced and has had to start over. He had a Airbed from a store but kept having to bring it back due to leaks and other problems. This bed looked much more comfy and with my Prime discount I sent it to him. Within the two day time frame it arrived and as soon as the other bed sprung another leak he put it to work. He says it's very comfy compared to the other so if he's happy I'm happy with the product
positive,"Great Workout: I was drawn to this DVD because of the title. It is a great workout, both cardio and strength. Lisa herself has communicated with me a few times to check in to see how I was doing and that impressed me a lot. Being new to exercising, I was not sure what to expect from this workout. Lisa's introduction on how to properly use the bells was great and is a workout in itself. I started out using a 10 lb. weight, even though she recommends 15-20 lbs. for women. The workouts are long enough so you feel it, but not too long as to interfere with your daily life. I am impatiently awaiting the second DVD from her. The only thing negative I can say is I wish I would have known what weights were recommended before purchasing. Overall, the exercised are great and really work different muscles than if you just used regular free weights. There are 3 workouts, upper, lower and circuit and all leave me feeling like I got a great workout."
positive,Saving the Past And returning to the Present: This book is about a boy who gets a toy castle as a gift and working with a knight going from the present into the past saving a old town from a evil ruler(Alastor).The town was saved and they wanted the knight and the boy to rule their town but the boy refuses and goes back to the present and the knight stays to protect the town from any other evil rulers.
positive,"A wonderful insite to the mind: I'm a HUGE fan of Baum.Always have been. Ever since I was a kid. Reading Baum in published order is an ever ongoing project with me. Now I'm not one who wants to take apart the wonderful stories and put all the elements into little boxes and find out what they are make of, but this book does something that is just the opposite. It takes the stories and looks at them in the order in which they were written! This book is a wonderful look at the ""periods"" in the Baum Canon. This is a great look at how say something like the Life and Adventures of Santa Clause and Queen XiXi of IX relate to each other. Great writing and research makes this book a MUST for any Baum collector."
positive,"Excellent and informative: This is a very clear, thorough, well-written book. It details many aspects of setting up a small wood shop, from layout to electrical work to insulation and soundproofing. The author also talks about what tools to select and suggests a priority order for people who cannot get all they want at once. It is an excellent source of information for anyone from hobbyists to beginning professionals."
positive,"mello somthing to grove to!: Im a big follower of good music like,marvin gaye,stevie wonder,george benson,donnie hathaway and alot more so i know good music when i hear it, and this is. vocals are very cool kind of reminescent of donnie or jonathan buttler but,his writting and production skills are amazing,also he played all the instruments . this is a must get cd from a brother who is definatly up and coming good luck,can't wait til your next."
positive,The best concert video !!!!!: This is the best concert video ever. Great show and great music ! Tina Turner's show still gets better every time she tours ! Now we have it in perfect DVD picture and DTS sound.
positive,"OH MY GOD GET THIS ALUBUM>>>ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE 1ST!!: It's hard to top the first album that I got when I was 9 but this one almost does it. GET IT!!! Or if you are repelled@by the negative comments of others, DO ME A FAVOR AND GET THE FIRST!!!!@If you are going to read a book read Dangerous Angels: The Weetzie Bat books by Francesca Lia Block!"
negative,"Defective, junk: My unit will charge, and power on. However it completely discharges in less then 10 minutes when charging my ipod. This has a 1200mAh battery in it. A 30gb 5th gen ipod has a 450mAh battery. You should be able to get 2 complete charges on your ipod, but my unit wont even get 1/4 of a charge."
positive,Great cover and nice book: Boo hoo so it is full of nice bodies and the problem with that is? There are some nice photo's in this book and you can pick it up used for about $10 bucks.It's a good deal.Barry
positive,"Really liked the book: When I first read the book a lot of years ago, i loved it and thought it should have been made in to a movie It's been at least 30 years since I first read it. I enjoyed it so much"
positive,"a bronx tale: I love this movie and been looking in stores for it, but its discontinued. So i turn to the internet and found it to my suprise"
negative,"Zero stars if there was an option!!: This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative."
negative,"I Don't Agree with other Reviews!: I feel while there are some aspects of this book that are good, such as singing some rap songs...the actual sedar is out of sequence!!!! This meal is called a seder , from a Hebrew root word meaning ""order,"" because there is a specific set of information that must be discussed in a specific order.In this book, the story is told first, then the four questions are asked. I think the authors could have kept the fun in this but done a better job following the correct order."
negative,"Where is it: Ordered this and it never showed up, as usual Amazon made things right with a quick refund"
positive,"Using for our 1 year old.: We have been looking for a front-facing car seat for our son, who turned 1 year last month. Looked around and I should honestly say that I did not find much choice (Targets, Walmarts, BabaysRUs and Amazon etc). Bought this, going by the positive reviews. Doesnt seem to be a bad choice, has a nice fluffy padding (suggested by our friends that we should go with one which is comfortable for the little bottom). Installation was easy with the LATCH in our Odyssey. The tightening of the belt around the latches was a bit hard though. The top anchor held the seat tight in place. Like another reviewer said, the box says the seat is for 22 to 80 pounds and 32 to 54 inches children. But our son, who is 26 inches fits in fine in the seat. I especially liked the front lever, which lets you loosen the 5-point harness belt before placing the child in the seat and once seated, lets you tighten the belt to suit his body/clothing on the given day. Overall, satisfied with the purchase."
positive,"very good: This is a great cd. It takes a few times listening to it to start enjoying it,then it sounds like a new,but familiar lagwagon. This one was dedicated to Derrick Plourde, their original drummer that played the blistering drums on duh,trashed, and hoss. He committed suicide in 2005. This album is very well written,even though it only took them 2 weeks to write the songs. This album is definately up there in their top 5 albums."
negative,"Bad, bad, bad: What a horrible book; hard to read; too many characters; I never did figure out what the whole thing was about. I can't believe this won a Nobel Prize. Definitely a waste of time reading."
negative,"Partially inacurrate - Grobel needs to do more homework!: Many things written about Collin Green in this book are untrue, and Larry Grobel should have known better after meeting him in person. But apparently he chose to take the word of others without checking out whether it could be true or not, medically. How many other things did Mr. Grobel just take people's word on, without checking them out?!? Collin Green would certainly be justified in suing Mr. Grobel and the publisher to have those things removed from any future printings and is owed an apology!"
positive,"easy upgrade for Dell Inspiron 600m: The Apricon EZ Upgrade kit worked flawlessly to upgrade the disk in a Dell Inspiron 600m with Windows XP. Cloning the Dell's 60GB disk to a new 250GB Western Digital WD2500BEVE took about an hour for copying, and a few more minutes to swap the drives. If you upgrade this or similar Dells, you will need to remove the pin adapter from the old drive and put it onto the new drive before inserting the new drive in the Dell drive caddy."
positive,"suspenseful: For a alien type of novel by Stephen king it is very good , lenghtly on certain sections but overall it held your attention because you really wanted to know what happens and if anyone at all survive especially in Kings Novel with ending that is all way a SURPRISE."
positive,"So Far So Good!: I've only worn this for a day so far, but I love it! I still have a little bit of a tummy from the birth of my son 8 months ago. This really holds you in, its comfortable and I don't think it shows through your clothes! I highly recommend!!"
positive,"Upbeat, a great addition to an eclectic collection: I saw this group in concert while visiting relatives. They are amazing performers and apparently have been doing this over 50 years. I bought CD's for friends and relatives I knew would be uplifted by this music. It's good stuff!"
negative,"Don't waste your money: I ordered this because my apartment doesn't have a light switch in the living room. It worked fine for about a week, then occassionaly would take 3 or 4 clicks to get the light to turn out. Now it will work 1 out of maybe 100 attempts, and only within 6 feet of the outlet. Terrible"
positive,"Wild,Weird: Home Fries is an endearing dark comedy. The movie is filled with wild, weird twists and turns revolving around the death of a cheating step-father.The movie is flat out,laugh out loud funny. There is also a completely charming romance between one of the step-sons and the pregnant girlfriend of the step-dad.Drew Barrymore is radiant as the girlfriend and Luke Wilson is perfect as her messed up suitor.Add Catherine O'Hara as the crazy Mom and Jake Busey as the going crazy brother-and you have a don't miss movie!"
positive,"A Ladder tro dream about: After spending a lifetime on shakey unstable ladders, my first climb on the Little Giant made me wonder where it had been my whole life. While heavy, it offers stability unmatched and versatililty of application. It is worth every dollar."
positive,"officeparty: This movie rocks. Anybody who has a job should find it funny. Especially if you HATE your job. lol. Everytime I watch it, I find more things to laugh about. The characters work so well together and remind me so much of people that I know in my own life."
negative,"Dawn on a Distant Shore: I was hoping that this would be a great sequel, but was very disappointed. The characters, except for Hanna did not develop at all. Nathaniel and Elizabeth had the beginning of a relationship in the first book and their characters were well developed, but they were very two dimensional in this book. That said I await the next book because I trust Ms. Donati will continue the story without destroying the characters."
positive,"Beautiful, original, perfect: This ancient symbol is quite difficult to find in a local store. But I wanted a triskell so badly, that I started looking in the internet. After much comparing, I chose this one: nice price, and the craft looked good. I must say that I'm not disappointed at all. It's size is quite good, it looks very nice, and the making looks great to me. My friends loved it at once, and I have even bought a couple more as gifts. Even the people who know nothing about the magical and symbolic meanings of the triskell notice it at once, and love it. I certainly recommend this particular triskell, as well as Silver Insanity, the seller. They're very responsible, and always include a small cloth bag in the package for the jewelry. I've also bought from them other charms, such as a couple of trees of life, and a phoenix, and they're all great and beautiful."
positive,"Outstanding: Christian Bale makes the best Batman so far, and the rest of the cast, especially Michael Caine and Liam Neeson, are superb. Production values don't leave anything on the table. It's a suspenseful thrill ride from start to finish."
positive,"Very good....: Well when most people of World War Two, they mostly think about the Canadian, British and American heros but never really considered the aspects of the Germans. Well this book will fill you in about how the ""Jungeden"" of the German army. Its about a boy drafted in this division of the army, how he gets stuck behind enemy lines and how he pretends to be a Russian Private. A must-read!"
negative,"laminator: This product was never in stock and I was refunded my money. The next time I placed this order from another listing, the wrong product was sent."
negative,"Awful: This book is little more than glorified toilet paper.Go buy some Charmin . . . it's softer, the words on the package are more interesting, and it won't burn your a** when you realize you've wasted your money.I'm serious. This book is about aliens that live in your ... and look like red gold, legless weasles. Laugh, it's ok! ... I did! This story has to be a joke. If it is, Mr. King, I salute you for your humor.If you seriously thought this was a powerful work of literature or even a slightly entertaining read, you're a butt weasle."
negative,"work of fiction ------jett and oj simpson: The only way to improve this work of fiction would be to have O.J. Simpson write the foreword.Jett was given an opportunity and the capital to succeed. O. J. let his footprints behind, jett should pick up his shoes and stop blaming others"
negative,"Buy the Bose QC-3's instead: Bought these, tried them at home and was not impressed with the sound quality for being a Sennheiser model. Know that I am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to sound quality, but I thought the noise-cancelling feature was more of a weak sound boost and the large noise-cancelling microphone was awkwardly placed halfway down the cord.I returned these and went back to the Bose store and purchased the QC-3's, which sound much better (clearer highs and deeper lows), have a more comfortable fit, have a built in noise-canceling microphone and a rechargeable battery. Yes, the Sennheisers are almost 1/3 the price of the Bose set, but if you're serious about sound quality and appreciate well designed functionality, then trust me, just get the Bose set - you won't regret it."
positive,"This is how textbooks should be written!: Of the 5 books I own that explain Seismic Refraction principles, Professor Burger is the only one who took the time to walk you thru step-by-step on interpreting a Seismogram. That is the sign of a true teacher and an Author who's not afraid of a little extra effort to help his students practically apply the knowlege. I only wish I lived closer to attend his classes!I do agree with the others in that an IBM PC version of the diskettes is long overdue, but this book still gets my 5 star rating!"
positive,"Such a fun book! Please bring it back in print.: My three sons were all delighted by this book when they were toddlers and preschoolers. It is so much fun to read together, with the young child laughing as they turn the page and discover where the movable spider has hidden (for example, they lift the flap of the toilet lid and there's the spider with the words, ""Silly Spider, what are you doing there!?!"").I wish that they would bring this book back into print. Because it was one of our favorites, I had wanted to give a copy as a gift to my friends and nieces for their own children. But it's not available :-( Please bring Silly Spider back so that more young children can enjoy his silly adventures."
negative,"Bad Selection!!!!: Why dont the people who chose songs for Mangione's compilations, instead of just keep putting the same old songs on compilation after compilation, pick some new ones. Perhaps the only reason to buy this album is for ""Floating,"" as it is the only song not yet used for a Chuck Mangione compilation."
negative,"Bubble Gum: The experienced businessman/woman should pass on this one. The book is reminiscent of a required ""bubble gum"" text in a freshman level business course at a community college. I only wish the book had more pages so that it would make an even better paperweight."
negative,Poor option: Why would someone pay for what they cannot have? Let the customer choose the color of the product they want to purchase!
negative,Abnormal Activity 4 Review: I was very disappointed in this film. It was not scary or very realistic. It was just not what I expected based on trailers about the movie. I would not recommend it due to stated reasons.
positive,"Lots of Good Information: I am currently taking a birthing class and it did not cover many areas that this DVD covers. I am so glad I purchased this video. The price is very good for the information received.Updated 30 Nov 10 :This video was a life saver. The useful information allowed me to make an informed decision for having natural child birth vs medical intervention and delivery (epidural and possible C- section). I had natural child birth and was very pleased to find out that the pain was tolerable without medication and I wasn't hooked up to anything except a Hep lock. If you are having your first baby you should watch this video with your spouse/partner so that you can create a birth plan before delivery. Also, look at the Business of Being Born video by Ricki Lake it is also very informative."
positive,End of the beginning: I've been a fan of Freebo's since the days he backed up Bonnie Raitt on fretless bass and blues tuba. I recently had the opportunity to see him playing with Maria Muldaur. I met him after the show and bought his CD based on hearing him perform one tune from it. This CD is a killer! I don't know how he's managed to hide his songwriting and singing abilities all these years but I'm sure glad he has finally come to the front and given us a much fuller picture of his talents. The span of musical genres on this album is breathtaking and his backup players are the best in the business. Everything from reggae to full-out rock. I hope he has more of this to share with us in a follow on album. This was worth the wait to hear him leading the way! Try it. You'll like it!
negative,"Buy the Originals: Many of the numbers are by ""members of the band"" and do not give the true sound of the original. Some of the vocals are truly bad. Save your money and buy the originals which are readily available at reasonable prices."
positive,A classic tale of friendship and loyality.: Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a classic tale of loyalty and friendship. It is about two friends name George Milton and Lennie Small who are a couple of laborers going from job to job. Both share a common dream of owning some land and being treated fairly. It was well written and I enjoyed reading it very much. I recommend it to everyone.
positive,"An Important and Influential Work: I read this book several years ago when I was just beginning to explore metaphysics. I didn't understand everything in it; the book is rather technical and quite esoteric. Nonetheless, it was a fascinating read, and the book affected me on an energetic level in ways I cannot explain. I was just beginning to open to channel around this time, and reading this book bumped up my vibration and opened up my frequencies in remarkable ways. Few books have ever had such a profound effect on me. I believe it was a crucial tool on my path to becoming a channel myself."
positive,"Like Everyman, Every Southern Family: Almost didn't watch this movie....wasn't in the mood for musicians trying to be actors....but decided what the hey, might be lighthearted and worth the video rental price...ended up really enjoying it, even coming to amazon.com to buy it. This film has many southernisms and dysfunctional-but-you-gotta-love-them familyisms. We adopted several lines in our own family ""You know yo Daddy love us!"" ....a certain sign that we enjoyed it! It had excellent situational comedy and Whoopi plays the most understated part of her career, and it really works!"
negative,"utterly unbelievable: Expecting a decent read, I was severely disappointed as I have read other Belva Plain books. The character of Hyacinth is totally unbelievable. How can a person live in this world and be so utterly ignorant of what real life is? The further I got into the story, the more incredulous and indignant I became. She allowed her husband to victimize her. Yes, he was despicable but she took it all. If this woman loved her children and wanted them with her as much as she claimed, she would have at least pursued some kind of second opinion, confidential consultation, something! And what about any true and lasting remorse expressed for the accidental death? She only expresses fear of spending time in jail. The woman exists in a complete cocoon. How sympathetic is that for a character? Spare yourself this book."
negative,"8 Crazy Nights: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! One reviewer states, ""the funniest Christmas movie ever"". This could not be farther from the truth. I like many of A. Sandler's movies. However, this movie sucked really bad. It was crude and not funny (reindeer pooping and eating poop?...come on!). It was irritating and not funny (the old man's voice was so grating, it made you want to scream five minutes into the movie). Most of all, the movie was boring and embarrassing to watch in mixed company. I still can't believe I wasted $4.00 to rent it."
positive,"Sterling film making: The film is long; the impact is devastating. The entire cast is so commited that singling out Crowe and Pacino and Plummer seems unfair. The fact that this is a true story makes the film all the more terrifying. Are we really this manipulated by the media, by constraints of big business? Can we ever know the truth about such issues? As long as films like this surface we are fortuantely forced to stand and ask. A triumph of film making that addresses contemporary foibles."
positive,"Great Book , i ever read: Great , great book!!People , who leave bad comments ,just didn't got what this book about ! This book about REAL woman , not about real bitch ."
positive,"Good game, but not Leapster's best: This is a good game, but not the most fun game Leapster has come up with. My son likes it b/c he liked the movie, but it doesn't hold his attention for long. I have noticed an improvement in his letter and number skills though."
negative,"Stout is great, his reader is abominable: Saul Rubinek, who reads many of Rex Stout's books on tape, is excellent. For my money, he's the best in the business. For that reason, it was with some reservation that I purchased Fer-De-Lance read by Michael Prichard. Would that I had listened to my reservations. Prichard can't read. He has a voice that could sell a lot of Buicks on tv ads between innings on a Sunday afternoon. He should be kept well away from actual prose. Long pauses in the middle of clauses, no awareness of the meaning of the words that come stumbling out of his mouth. My best guess is that Prichard is the result of a bizzare experiment in which he learned perfect English pronunciation but has absolutely no understanding of the meaning of any of the words in the English language, and he sees punctuation as unnecessary decoration."
positive,"Not the real deal, but not bad: I am an avid Anne of Green Gables fan. I've read the books and own the two box sets of the movies. I can't tell you how excited I was when I heard there was to be another Anne of Green Gables movie coming out. I waited in anticipation to see it. Although I must admit I was a little disappointed this movie diverted from the books, I did enjoy watching it. It would have been nice to have the story follow the books and pick up with Anne's married life with Gilbert in Avonlea. Other than that, I thought this movie was done fairly true to the feel and tone of the orignal movies. The music, sweeping views, and nostalgia were fairly well represented. I was thoroughy excited to see the original actors in the first two set of videos return to play their characters. For me there is no other Anne Shirley, Gilbert Blythe or Diana Barrie than played by Megan Follows, Jonathan Crombie and Schuyler Grant."
negative,"Bad customer service and Cheap Printers: We have had our printer for a little for over a year (also a bit over warranty, of course). We have had a paper feeding issue, so I spent two hours on a phone with someone from India trying to correct the problem. They eventually sent me a new one. Recently, we have had a problem with a big black line through our scanned images. Called again and since it was over a year, they would not help us. AAAH..I will not buy again."
positive,"Contemplating: Have been interested in starting an advocacy organization. This book is clearly written, appears to be authoritative and comes from a person who seems to care about the field. I finished the book mildly encouraged but with some respect for the complexities involved. Note that this is only about the legal issues of non profits, not ""managing"" non profits per se."
negative,"Not worth your money: These DVD's are not worth your money! Picture and sound qualities are very bad, it looks like the DVD itself were re-recorded from a VHS, you can hardly understand anything the lady is saying because very poor sound and the items on the pattern envelopes are blurry you can't understand anything. Waist of your money!"
negative,"so close, yet so far... i give 5 stars for effort.: i wanted to like this documentary very badly. i was completely excited when i received it. this had Unwound, Sleater-Kinney, The Make-Up and many others. some parts are genuinely interesting. but unfortunately nothing was given that i could really enjoy. the sound makes some (not all) of the live footage fairly unlistenable and the footage so dark i can barely see the people in some parts. mostly i wanted to see Unwound, what a horrible shock to find that halfway through their performance commentary starts playing! i was angered and felt cheated. the interviews were safe and boring, offered nothing new and some of the people were unbearable to hear talk. it was such a great idea and i wanted to love it from the beginning. maybe my expectations were too high?"
positive,"Moonstruck-A cheesy classic tale of love: This movie is great! Nick Cage when he was younger and Cher when she was...well...anyhow...they both look great and the story is clever and well built on the same grounds as La Boheme, a Lover's classic Opera tale. Cameos by a lot of great actors of our time. The roots of the Catholic Italians in New York is intriging...and the whole issue of age and it's timelessness...Definitely one for the collection!"
negative,"BORING SELF-INDULGENT DRIVEL: As another woman who has actually reached the summit of Mt. Everest, I found this book to be nothing more than self-indulgent ""New Age"" drivel. Gammelgaard offers no insight into why the disaster happened and virtualy ignores the other climbers who were on Everest that day. The book has none of the gripping suspense of Into Thin Air and none of the factual reporting of The Climb. I'm happy Gammelgaard survived but she should turn her attentions to things other than writing. One of the worst books I've yet to read!"
negative,"Don't buy this book unless you already know JAVA: The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money. Thanks to the deceiving reviews, I now need to spend more money to get a real beginner JAVA book."
negative,"Pretty bad date movie: I saw this movie in a movie theater with my boyfriend, and by the middle of it, we left. I've never seen anything so stupid and not funny in the same movie. The humor is pretty bad, and might even be offensive for some people. Don't they have anything better to do than make fun of other movies that are at least worth to watch?"
positive,"Brilliant Re-invention: Great Album! Binaural is probably in the top 3 greatest Pearl Jam albums, along with Ten and Vs.One reason is its one of the best musically technical records for Pearl Jam. Matt Cameron's drumming also drives the band into another world of rythme and makes them sound heavier than ever.The finer songs of the album are the hard rocking ""Insignificance"", ""Grievance"", ""Breakerfall"" and ""God's Dice"".The softer yet graceful tunes are ""Light Years"", ""Thin Air"", and ""Parting Ways"". ""Soon Forget"" is a well written little uke solo.And of course, there's the melancholic yet beautiful ""Nothing As It Seems""."
negative,"From M.E. student: This digital caliper sucks! First off you have to extend the caliper extremely slow for it to be somewhat accurate. When it ""skips"" it gives no error like other ones do. It just gives you a wrong reading. This caliper sucks, don't buy this crap."
positive,"Great! But wanted more story about Ramsey.: I really loved this book, but I had been waiting since ""The Secret"" for a story that I hoped would focus on Ramsey Sinclair, as he was written to be the more ""irresistible"". I enjoyed Brodick but didn't find his character in ""The Secret"" to be that exciting. At any rate, ""Ransom"" is well written and I did enjoy reading it."
negative,Not recomended: I would not use this book or any by this author. She has a Dogmatic approach which lends itself to be a one way view.It has some valid material but for someone who is serious about Witchcraft don't bother unless you like to be subject to her moral dogmatic beat down. Start with Scott Cunningham and avoid her material.
positive,"Great story and illustrations: My 3 year old loved this book and wanted it every night. She identified with the little rabbit growing up and wanting to be independent, and of course the happy ending at the end. The pictures are very detailed and she loved to point out little details like the mice houses at the tree base and the giant mushrooms."
negative,"Shocked at the Inefficiency and Utter Disregard of the Sender(s): This book is incredible, along with the two other books I ordered from the same sender: a collection of poems by Langston Hughes and one by Maya Angelou; however, whoever sent me these books piled them onto a single layer of cardboard and wrapped the texts in plastic wrap--yes, plastic wrap!! The books got to my door all smashed. Even though they were hardcover books, they are all ruined. Luckily, the pages are still readable. I STRONGLY recommend that other book lovers like myself avoid this seller!!!!"
negative,"Such poor quality!: I guess I should have known that the quality of the movies on this DVD would be poor. But I was stoked to find 3 movies that I love on the same DVD. Great movies, very poor quality.It would be more wise to spring for each movie seperately."
negative,"Baby wet indeed!: We have been using Pampers sensitive ever since my son was born. When he turned one year old, Pampers sensitive doesn't work well during night time anymore and I was on a mission to find a good night-time diaper for him. I purchased Pampers Baby Dry (or should I call it Baby Wet?), all I can say is that it didn't work at all. We have to change diapers every 3 hours both in the day time and night time. Definitely a waste of money and we had to throw out half box of the unused ones.My 12-month-old boy usually sleeps through the whole night. It just hurt me so much when he was waken up by wet diapers and needed to take another 30 minutes to fall asleep again. Pampers Sensitive is the way to go for daytime, and for night time I happily found Huggies Overnite."
positive,"""A Majority of one"": I have been a big fan of the movie ""A Majority of One"" for many years. I have a ""tape"" of the movie, but was thrilled when the movie came out on DVD. Rosalind Russell is superb. The interaction between Rosalind and Alec Guiness is extremely pleasurable to watch from the time they met on the ship to their relationship in Japan. The scenes with Rosalind dressed in the Japanese Kimono were priceless. The ending was extremely enjoyable leaving the audience to draw its own conclusion on where their relationship would go."
positive,Very funny book: I originally stumbled across this book in a little bookstore. I thought it was hilarious and knew a friend who would appreciate reading it.
positive,Karyn Jordan: I received this product in a timely manner. Great service and great price! I will definitely purchase again from Amazon.com.Thanks for everything!
positive,"Could be Austen's best: Persuasion has been on my must-read list for a long time, ever since I read Sense and Sensibility and became an Austen fan. This edition is easy to read because the print is just the right size. The novel is one of if not her shortest and this version has very thing pages making the entire book weight nothing. I read it on my trip from the USA to the Caribbean and it is a page turner. I couldn't put it down even though I was tired and it was a night flight. The cover's very cute design is icing on the cake. It now occupies a space in my permanent library collection."
positive,"Great book to start!: The book is excelent because you can learn almost everything related do struts. The book is well written, but has some mistakes."
positive,"Very comfortable: These are great. They are not exactly eggplant colored, more like a lilac, but when my eyes are closed I can't tell. They fit perfectly, with nice deep corners. They are soft even before they are washed. Great Sheets."
positive,"Fantastic!: ""Sisterchicks on the Loose"" is a fun and hilarious read! Women of all ages can relate to these two crazy sisterchicks, lost in drama and searching for God in the midst of their adventures. You'll both tear up and giggle while reading this fantastic story! =)"
negative,Just awful: This was possibly the worst book I have ever read. I am amazed by the number of fans for this kind of rubbish.
positive,Hope seasons 5 and 6 come out soon: I love this show! I ordered seasons 5 and 6 in July of 2011. Maybe the DVDs will be out in 2013.
positive,the mummy returns: I have enjoyed this movie so much that I also bough it in DVD. It is very entertaining and not a dull moment in the film. Keeps you on your toes with anticipation.
negative,"Bullsh#+!!: Perhaps by the time you read this Amazon will be clearer in its TiVo description, but in case they aren't, you NEED to know that this is just the hardware for a monthly PAY service. I REALLY felt taken for a ride on this, as they referred to it as a ""service plan""-- well, I don't have a ""service plan"" on my oven, and it works just fine. It is completely misleading to call the fee they charge every month a ""service plan"".Tivo won't be getting a penny of mine. . ."
positive,Fun Book for you and your little one: This is great little book. I love that it has easy to understand signs to teach my daughter. Adds a playful dimension to this classic song.
positive,F Troop Review: The best show ever to come on televisionI can`t wait for the next season to be released.
negative,Do Not Buy This DVD!: The songs are edited and cut short. There is an interview over top of one of the songs. The last song is cut short with scrolling credits. Whoever released this DVD should be ashamed!Do Not buy this DVD!!!!!!!
positive,"Great overview for those interested in the event industry: I have worked in the event industry for the last three years and decided to read through this book prior to getting into the industry. After gaining more experience and being apart of both small and large events I can honestly say that this book has a ton of applicable information. I highly recommend this book if you plan on entering the event industry, putting on your own event, or just would like to see how much time, effort, and planning goes into events."
positive,"Decent product for the price: Decent quality picture. Menu/option screens linger a bit longer than i prefer. Upscaling is decent but not optimal. You can see some very obvious hazing/fuzziness of distant objects. I would say upscaling quality is closer to a 720p than a 1080i (but i am no expert). Overall, for a model in the $50 - $70 dollar range i think it is a good buy."
negative,"This is music that doesn't matter!: Strained and boring, this is Bowie without a clue. No follow up to his proposed trilogy, only two tedious albums of nothing to speak of bring us to ""Hours"". A man that was once a role model is now a complacent bore. Too bad."
positive,Works perfect: This cable works just as well as the $70 monster cable I bought a year ago. If you need an HDMI cable to do the job this is the one plus the price is ultra fair.
negative,"HUGE DISAPOINTMENT: 3 Days after seeing this ""Movie"", and I'm still mad! How in the world did this happen. This movie has nothing to do with the spirt of Anne of Green Gables. Oh it's so bad! So sad that someone could have taken such a sweet gentle story and turned it into this mess! and sell it to the public as an Anne of Green Gables sequal. GRRRRRRRRR! Save your money and your time, Run from this one!"
negative,"Memory Pak Failed on me ..: At first impression, I loved the HyperPak ... however - after about a week's worth of using, the memory side of the pak became corrupted and crashed on me - and the rumble side sometimes goes off on its own tangent and does whatever it wants to.The rumble, however, is still operational and a great feature - the 2x rumble really makes games come alive ..."
negative,"Good coffee terrible machine: We are on our third B-70 in two and half years. I regret having ever recommended this coffee system to friends and family. Our household brews about 6 cups a day, after about six months the machine would start making short cups after another couple of months the machine just stopped working. We cleaned our second and third machine twice a month and still had the same problem. Of the dozen friends and family that purched or received as a gift from us a B-70, everyone is on at least their second some on their third machine. While it does make very good coffee having to replace a the machine every 8 months is very annoying. We have gone back to brewing coffee the old fashion drip way. It's cheaper and we don't have to feel guilty about throwing those little plastic coffee pods."
negative,"Total waste of money: The developers at Eidos really blew it this time. The game is so full of bugs it makes me sick. First of all, the box says nothing about laptop compatability problems, but upon checking the Eidos tech support page, you learn that they won't support laptop systems.Anyways, I installed the software on my desktop. The game crashes every several minutes. I have installed all of the newest drivers and my computer excedes the recommended hardware profile in every way. Gameplay is tolerable, but nowhere near as good as I had hoped it would be. In fact, Chronicles was more fun and was more of a challenge.I ended up returning the game because it is not only not worth the money, but it is also a waste of time. If you do take the gamble, make sure you buy this game from a store that accepts software returns. Good luck!"
negative,"Mac users.. beware!: I was all excited about my first mp3 player.. I spent tons of time researching and decided on the yepp...BUTThe Yepp DOES NOT work with OSX or iTunes 2.0...so even though I am on OS9, I had iTunes 2.0.. no go.. they said that they shipped from Korea without correcting it and that there are no plans as of right now to correct it.The customer service department was pretty helpful and offered to refund my money if the store I bought it from would not. but STILL.. a sticker warning people would be nice.. so now I am trying to Rio800.. we shall see."
positive,"THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!: The Noble House is by far one of the best of Clavell's works! I got so caught up in the drama between Quillan Gornt and Ian Dunross that I couldn't put the book down. I didn't want it to ever end, and when it did I was very very very upset!! I enjoyed the book so much that I found out I wanted to learn more about the characters. I learned about the stock market and bank counsels, etc. I loved this book and I recommend it to everyone and anyone!! It's the kind of book that once you start reading it, you'll never ever ever want to put down. If you're looking for a book with drama, passion, intenseness, murder, mystery, and thrill, you should read The Noble House. It's a wonderful tie in of all of Clavell's books and I simply loved it!"
negative,"Eh. With so much talent, they put out this?: Given the reputations of those involved, especially Shales, this is a hellacious disappointment and certainly not worth the hardcover price at any discount. They couldn't even get Murphy to talk to them and, given that he saved the show, that is a major problem in a book of this size and alleged scope. O'Donoghue, who was viciously brilliant, is reduced to a parody. There's nothing here you couldn't have figured out from reading years of tv commentary or watching the show."
positive,"Clear and to the point: This is an excellent textbook for an introductory course in Real Analysis. The text is rigorous, but contains enough examples to be readily understood. If you honestly want to learn the subject matter, this book is worth the money. However, if you would rather struggle with it, there are plenty of those books floating around . . ."
positive,Awesome baby prunes!: My daughter loves these! The only thing I wish they would change would be to make the package recyclable.
negative,"Burn it!: This book, whilst very good to begin with, fails in the end beacause Bradbury attemptes to beat his message in too late in the piece. He spends too much time describing the story, and his message, as he has rendered it, is too complex to cram into 180 pages. I was told to read this book in school, but was not forced, as i have a passion for reading. Anyone who now loves the name ""clarrise"" for the sole fact that she was a nice person in the novel is a wierdo. But, other than that, i found it to be a tolerablebook, up until the death of beatty, when the novels plot development peters out, and we are left feeling cudgeled for the rest of the novel by its ""moral"" Im only 13, so nyah BURN THE BOOK! bradbury has failed miserably in creating this book."
positive,"YES, INDEED!: These are great! I use them to make my own Southern-style hot sauce by putting 12 whole peppers in a blender, along with red wine vinegar and some freshly ground organic salt. Let me put it this way: I don't buy hot sauce in the stores, anymore!"
positive,"Simply riveting: Though it can be a bit of a drag at times, this excellent autobiography is threaded with the best of humour (though probably unintended by it's author). 'Tis marvelous."
positive,Looking forward to reading other books by this author: This book was so fascinating that I could not take a break from reading it. I look forward to reading Dr. Han's books The Secret Life of Quanta and The Probably Universe.
negative,"Crocodile Doom: The product is flaky, fragile and small. My son was dissapointed to see just how small and fragile it was. He played with it once and threw in a corner. And he loves boardgames and creative games. I was dissapointd too. I paid too much for too little."
negative,"This thing is a hunk of junk.: Don't believe the last review. I had mine about a month before I tossed it out the window somewhere near Charlotte, NC. Nothing but problems, barely recieved or transmitted and was extremely weak when it did. I actually had truckers ask me to stop transmitting because all they could hear was squealing when I keyed. Tossed it, kept my K40 antenna, bought a Uniden Pro538W and have loved it! Much better radio! Don't buy anything Cobra makes!"
negative,"Pay a few dollars more for the swaddlers: I tried to save a buck and get the baby dry instead of my usual swaddlers.....Big mistake, I have ruined a bunch of outfits because #2 rides up the back of these.Penny wise pound foolish, spend the extra few bucks and get the swaddlers."
negative,The French Connection: This DVD was very disappointing because it was not the full movie. It ended in America with the Frenchman returning home. The movie was much longer with Popeye Doyle going to to Paris to follow up on the case. The most exciting and important conclusion of the film was deleted.
negative,"Not worth the price...: I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress. First, it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing. Second, it did almost nothing to slim me down, even though I bought the suggested size. Third, after about a half hour of wearing it, it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable. It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in, and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress. I abandoned it completely and felt much better."
positive,"$$$ I LOVE LONG TIME $$$: Go Red Sox! With this hat people will know that you are a winner, just don't wear it sideways. Same hat as at stores but a few bucks cheaper. Thx!"
positive,"My son loves this toy!: My mom bought this for my 6 week old son, he has colic and he loves this toy. We have it on his changing table and I turn it on whenever I change his diaper. His favorite setting is with the bubbles. This toy is especially great because it is sometimes the only thing that soothes him during his colicky periods. Highly recommended."
positive,"It's Gemini Time: I love all of Brian McKnight's CDs, however ""Gemini"" to date is the Best!! From tracks #1 ""Stay with Him"" to #13 ""Me & You"" this project is some of the best R&B;, Inspirational & Gospel out there today.Thanks Brian!!"
negative,"Flimsy and cannot lock it securely: This box is flimsy which is in my expectation. It only has one off-center locking place which makes it impossible to lock it securely. For a box meant to store pistols, it should have a way to securely locking."
negative,"Oh no - I had to end it!: I agree with the others that gave it one star. I was expecting a much different movie. It was trying to be different, quirky, and funny and it was none of these things. I did not care about the characters because there was nothing of substance to care about. I realize it was a comedy that was supposed to be light and funny, but it did not make me laugh, in fact I was cringing at the performances especially the established older actresses. The songs were awful or maybe it was the bad singing and choreography. I am no movie critic and so if you want to risk the money be my guest. But, I rarely turn off a movie half way through and this I had to - booorrrrrinnnggg!"
negative,"Not stable, child climbed out and nearly flipped: My daughter was under 1 year at the time and was able to climb out and nearly flipped. We returned it."
negative,Crystal: Do not waste your money on this product. My kids used all products it contained in one sitting and is complicated for even my 15 year old niece!
negative,"Dumb Guns...but great soundtrack: Christopher Lambert and Ice-T are supposed to be the stars here, but what little depth this movie has comes from Michael Halsey, who turns a professional killer into a sympathetic figure (and that ANYONE can earn any sympathy in this bit of video treacle is itself an achievement).If you're not a big fan of bloodless, mindless gunplay, the only reason to buy this movie is for the soundtrack. Mambo fans will actually enoy it, as well as the Andean flute/guitar instrumental."
positive,Alpine Cat Scratcher Replacement Pad: This was a very good product at a reasonable price. The vendor shipped in a very timely manner. Very satisfied.
negative,"Awesome!: It's pretty awesome for such a price! It definitely gives you great posture, I was sitting up straight like no other! although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise it's wonderful!^^^^^ was my review when i had it for 15-20 days, now-- after ordering it on Jan, 21, 2012-- it's SO useless. I've washed it with care, it smells like rubber, and it's pretty nasty. I'd rather pay $$$ and buy something that works the way it should."
negative,Smallville:The Complete Ninth Season: I accidently orded blu-ray instead of dvd. I have sent two e-mails asking how I can exchange this and have had no response to either of them. At this point I'm very unhappy with Amazon and whoever else I ordered this from. There is no return address. We were looking forward to the ninth season and are unable to watch it. I don't think I will be ordering any more from Amazon.com
positive,"Love Pampers, hate the price: I love Pampers diapers but hate the price. I always buy Pampers for use overnight because they are one of the few brands of diapers that my son doesn't leak out of overnight."
negative,"TATU: This is the worst CD I have ever listened to. First fo all, the translation is just awful. I kind of liked their music when it was in russian (At least it made sense)."
negative,Moved to tears: I can not think of a worse idea than to ask an actess to come back and play an old character when she is quite clearly 20 years too old to pull it off!! I was so upset at how much this movie had lost the charm that is Anne of Green Gables I will never watch it again.
negative,"Looking at the script from a director's point of view: I bought this script because it is on my community theatre's schedule to perform in March. I was very surprised with how I little I liked the script in its entirety. I am familiar with Sure Thing because I worked on it in college, and was expecting more of the same...quick witted, funny pieces that would easily make for a night of entertainment. Honestly, due to content and language, I don't see how we can perform many of these plays on our stage. I know that the scholars are going to bash me, but from a director's point of view, I vote to shelf this one. No audience is going to want to sit through all 14 of these plays when most won't make much sense to them. They want to be entertained and walk away with a thought other than confusion at the end of the night. This script is perfect for college theatre, but that doesn't make me like it any more."
positive,"Definitely not one for the slow witted.: Tragically, I think that what most people didnt like about this movie of Joan, is the human mental effect it showed of Joan.. First though, great performance by Milla Jovovich.I only hope Hollywood gives her more dramatic type roles as i find her acting more moving than any 'hot' actress (like Angelica Jolie) in Hollywood right now.The erratic behaviour of Joan, is similar to one of a young man seeing his first sign of real combat. And I think that twisted side of the plot only enrich the movie.Bottom line, if you are looking for a nice sweet good versus bad movie, then get a mediocure End of Days. But if you like an alternative look at a classic story, The Messenger is the movie for you..PS. Keep ya eye out for Milla Jovovich."
positive,"Nice for the price.: I purchased this tent to take to the beach this summer for my 15 month old son to nap in. Although, we have not gone to the beach yet, I have set the tent up for him to play in and get familiar with so he won't be afraid of it at the beach. He was skiddish of it at first and I had to sit in it with him. He is used to it now and plays in it on our back porch almost every day! It seems as though it will be good shade on the beach and it was worth the money just for him to play in it at our house."
negative,"Teleprompter journalism: The storys of triumph and achievement are incredible and we owe a debt of honor to those who lived them and lived in the day. However the writing reminds me of a series of news segments on the nightly news. I found the book hard to read and bought the audio version and that too was unfinishable. I get a certain arrogance from Brokaw that I personally find hard to stomach. Just my opinion, I could be my revulsion of the product they put on the airwaves nightly and call the news."
positive,"Greatest Sports Movie: While the story is familiar (underdog becomes champion) the acting, screenplay and cinematography make you feel as if though you've never seen this type of story before. It is no wonder that ESPN voted this film the greatest sports movie of the century."
positive,"You Rock!: This book is an nice read. Another very good and easy to read book is Barack Hussein George W & The American Dream by B. Charles Henry, ISBN 1466312645. In addition, his homepage at Amazon's B. Charles Henry Page reveals some interesting APA scholarly written texts. These are two great authors."
negative,"Cliche city, what was Diane Lane thinking?: Diane Lane is a gifted actress who had just started to come into her own in recent times. I realise that good scripts aren't plentiful for actors over 35, but Diane should have left this one alone. I also have to agree with another reviewer about Diane's facial expressions during this film - quite annoying!Full of every cliche possible, the film does not allow you to think even for a second. On top of that, every scene seemed to be stolen from another movie.The scenery thankfully is the movie's saving grace. Watch it for that alone.Definitely disappointed with this."
negative,great...WHEN IT WORKS!: this is a great product in theory. i was only able to get it to capture a few minutes of video at a time before the product would shut down. goto dazzle website and read the pages! and pages! of customer complaints. be wary!
negative,"Big fan of Adams, but this book ...: I am a big fan of Dougles Adams books, at least in general.But this book is, at best, only marginally funny. Others have explored this topic, and with better results.The problem here is that Adams tries to make funny sounding words for things that don't have a name (like that little twist between link sausages), but constrains himself to using the names of small cities and towns from around the world. Occasionally, he hits a home run, but most of the words are strike outs.Disapointed.PS the 'name' for the link between sausages is kerry. Why, I don't know, and I have no idea why some think this is humorous."
negative,"Horrible Quality: This isn't at all like the Milton Bradley version, it's VERY VERY cheap brittle plastic. Ours arrived with the top portion of the head warped and unable to stay attached to the body which makes the game useless. But the overall plastic is cheap, there are stress marks all over the plastic that were not caused by us and unlikely caused by shipping.. This is what I would expect at a dollar discount store or flea market where you expect it to either not work, or only work a few times before breaking."
positive,"An excellent read: This is a charming and complete-in-its-own prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Full of adventures and excitement, but without the weight of such a complicated set of story lines as the Lord of the Rings series. One of my favorites!"
negative,"ZZZZZZZZZZ.....snooze-fest: Great, another socially aware electro-dance record. I can't wait for the an Iraqi to come out with one about the current US led invasion."
negative,"Never got to use it...: Some babies may like it, but ours never got the chance to use it. It doesn't fit her crib. Make sure you check that the top rails of your crib are small enough for the straps to fit around. Also, I think our particular toy may have been defective because the bubbles never worked and it was very loud and bright. Unfortunately, I had thrown away the box and literature before I knew all this or I would've taken it back. I will never do that again."
positive,"Interesting Reading: If you are from the baby boomer generation, you can truly understand what made your parents, aunts, and uncles of this generation who they were. Since the events of September 11th and after reading this book, I have a finer appreciation of what heroes are truly made of. I have a better insight into who my parents were and why. I also understand why I am the way I am and what these qualities that were passed down, did for me in my life. It also makes you appreciate the cost of freedom and what the men and women of the military did and continue to do to protect our liberties. Something I think we took for granted before September 11th. Enlightening book."
negative,"Extremely comfortable, but rips easily: These shorts are extremely comfortable, and do their job. However, I have had several pair that rip in the inner thigh. My most recent pair ripped after only 3 months of use, being worn 1-2x per week. Simply not worth the $."
negative,"Misleading pics and cheap shirts: I bought these shirts based on great reviews. After receiving them, I realize that it was a total mistake. I didn't even bother to put these on me, as the quality is horrible. By the way, Amazon will charge you money to ship them back as they don't consider ""item isn't as described on the web site"" is their fault. Things I found out about these shirts:1. The pictures are misleading. These aren't ""fitted"" shirts. They are quite big.2. Amazon search engine is misleading too. If you search ""fitted shirts"", these will show up, but in no mean they are fitted.3. Poor quality. They are see-through shirts. Unless you like to show off your underwear, these are horrible shirts.Do yourself a favor and don't order these shirts. You will be ~$8 happier."
positive,"A great glimpse of the now played-out ""Titanic"" Syndrome: I loved this movie. I saw this not too long ago. I had seen the movoie Titanic and thought ""poor boy meets rich girl, how cozy."" But now I see where the inspiration was! The movies music makes you want to dance, and the coreograpy makes you could dance like that with Patrick Swayze. I loved it and I give it 5 stars."
positive,Every counselor should have this book for reference: I purchased this book when I got a divorce. I knew it would be hard on my 5 year old and I wanted to give her as much support as I possibly could. This book was amazing in helping my daughter work thru issues. I am happy to say that she is fairly well adjusted and give this book partial credit. She is now 8 and this books still sits on her bookshelf for whenever she may need it.
positive,Awesome Book: This is such a great read. It is wonderful to have it as a digital title. I recommend reading as you plan to watch the movies.
negative,"Don't Waste Your Money!: I am writing this review because I don't want another person to read the editor's reviews and believe that this CD is anything but garbage. I am a huge fan of Dirty Vegas, but by far, this is not their best effort. In fact, it took no effort on their part at all. They put a couple of songs from the 80's and 90's and compiled them on one CD. There wasn't any great beats, vocal overlays, or anything to speak of that would have made this CD unique. I could have made this CD at home on my computer and ""mixed"" it better than this. Please, if you value your money spend it on something else. Let this CD go to the wayside. You will be better for it. I ended up giving my copy away!"
positive,"Great production of David Copperfield, delightful acting: I watched this with my daughter who prefers stories with easier language but she was crazy about this production and asked to get a copy of her own DVD. Very understandable because of the excellent acting but also very faithful to the story. Beautiful settings, and great costumes, this is the Masterpiece THeater production and keeps up the tradition well.I would recommend, especially for families with kids being introduced to DIckens."
positive,"Resurrection Indeed: Although it starts off a bit meandering, Resurrection Day quickly builds into a book difficult to put down. There are two phenomenal stories here. One is what if the Cuban Missile Crisis had turned into WWIII? The other is what the US might be like as a 3rd world nation. Both are compelling.DuBois writes engaging characters and fills his plot with enough turns to make a Ballerina tipsy. I repeatedly tried to geuss the ending, and even the next page, and was always stymied. The conversations flow convincingly, and the story is a joy to read.Here we are given a look at how Americans are like the rest of the world. If you strip them of the technological advantage, and the moral advantage of a well-constructed constitution that is actually followed, they respond like everyone else. Not badly, not well- just as humans, struggling to survive."
positive,"Star Wars 2: Nita has known about wizardry for a while. Her little sister, Dairine, is fascinated. But the Powers That Be only invite certain people to become wizards. Only if no one else can fix a problem. And Dairine has been chosen.Nita thought it would be a quiet day at the space museum. But when your a wizard and Dairine is your sister, nothing is ever quiet. With the help of a Wizard's Manual Laptop, Dairine finally gets the freedom she's dreamed of: she leaves Earth and heads out to explore the galaxy. Dairine thinks she's on a little vacation, but if she is on vacation, why are evil creatures following her? Why do the beautiful creatures she's created want to freeze all life forms? She soon finds out that the Lone Power, the most feared Power That Is is after her. And she's up to her neck in danger. Will she make it back to Earth all in one peice? Will she even be able to get to Earth at all?"
positive,"Good light stroller for traveling: I bought the Cosmo Ex Merlot Stroller really just for one purpose, that is to use in the airports and while traveling. I found it very light-weight and easy to carry around.These are the pluses:- Light-weight- Can be folded to compact size- Nice color and look- Can be reclinedMinuses- Feet tend to bump against the rear wheels- Canopy does not extend enough forward- Folding requires both hands (tough to do when holding baby)- Cushioning is not water-resistent- Basket is too small and tends to drag on the groundOverall, it's a good stroller for traveling, and it came out alright after gate-checked after couple of trips.It's perfect for the occasional travel and works well overall."
negative,"Great version, small print: I bought this bible, because I was wanting a good everyday devotional bible. I love the way that ESV puts things. I was very imressed with the cover. Great details. However, the print is too small for every day use in my opinion. I gave my copy to my mom, and she seems to really like it. So, if you're concerned about print size, check out the TruTone Personal Size Reference Bible. It is slightly larger and has bigger print without being bulky."
positive,"A point driven home by a brilliant writer: While some authors may have ruined this book by hammering the central theme of the novel with hackneyed phrases and over the top situations, Bradbury succeeds in twisting a tale that manages to nudge the reader towards his point of view. Brilliantly crafted and downright cunning, Bradbury proves to be one of the greatest writers of his, or any generation."
positive,"Wickedly Funny! Devishly Entertaining!: I have alway's been a fan of The Addam's Family TV show of the 1960's & when the movie came out in 91 I thought it was just another lousey re-make of an old TV classic. By time it came on video something inside me was urging me to rent it. I did and it was worth every penny I spent, I liked it so much I bought it when I took the movie back.The cast gives suberb performances especially Christina Ricci who, in my opinoin, stole the show from the rest of the cast. Angelica Houston, Raul Julia, & Christopher Lloyd also gave outstanding performances. The story is quite simple, Gomez (Julia) is still searching for his long lost brother Fester. When a greedy woman & her son get hold of the story & hear about the Addams' fortune she decides to dress her son up as Fester to get hold of the family fortune. Some of the most funny parts are watching Wendsday & Pugsly ""play"" with their electric chairs & butcher knives. A MUST SEE!"
negative,"Outdated and misleading code examples: If you are a designer who wants to know how to customize Plone's look beyond changing colors and fonts, you'll be disappointed in this book. Sure, the introduction is still good, but chapter 6 (for example), which instructs you to work with the Plone Base Properties file is giving you an outdated method, not well suited to upgrades and maintenance. I believe that stylesheets are the way to go, now...but I'm still trying to figure it out, no thanks to this book. The instructions for adding slots in Chapter 5 were just impossible to follow and did not even vaguely work. Yes, the text is in English, but the descriptions bear little resemblence to the Plone 2.1+ experience.This book will, however, give a somewhat glossy overview of the entire application. I would get a recent version of Andy McKay's book, and look elsewhere for customization help."
negative,"Horror?: In some funny way, this is absurd humor. Horror it ain't. Grasping at straws, it gets boring, so humorous it also ain't. So what's the point? I guess living up there in Maine, a body's got to do SOMETHING to while away the time."
negative,"This book is not ""hot."": I enjoy historical fictions, so I knew ""Fahrenheit 451"" was not my style, but I thought I would give it a go anyway. Well, I hated it. I did not like Ray Bradbury's style and I think he needs help! Who in their right mind would think of our world becoming so controlling and horrible? There are a lot of unanswered questions and undefined terms in this book, so you better get the Cliff's Notes, because without them, you'll be lost. Do not be surprised if you do not finish this book quickly, either! I did find the subject of book banning and censorship interesting, but I think it could have been told differently. I do not recommend this book!"
negative,"very disappointed: Keurig B50 Gourmet Single-Cup Brewing SystemCan I give it NO STARS? I just received this yesterday, purchasing it after much research, and was looking forward to fabulous coffee. I made 4 different cups from the samples provided. I used bottled spring water. All 4 were terrible, they tasted like vending machine coffee. I'm hoping that the samples were stale, since everyone seems to love this machine. Needless to say, I returned it."
negative,"Okish film: This movie of a bumbling policemean (Jimmy Fallon) and a go-getter taxi driver (Queen Latifah) sounds good when you read the blurb.The movies has its moments, especially when Queen Latifah appears on the screen. But, on the whole the movie does not deliver what it promises in the blurb. I would not recommend this movie. See the movie if you have no other options when you go to rent it at your local video store."
negative,"Don't be Deceived!: Don't be fooled, this is a cheap public domain copy of Beverly Hillbillies episodes; hence they do not contain the original music (Ballad of Jed Clampett, etc). and the sound and picture quality are abyssmal, not to mention the product stamp on every frame of the disc. If you're a true affectionado of the Hillbillies try ""The Ultimate Collection"" discs as they were produced by the estate of Paul Henning the creator of the show. Only the first two volumes have been released and hopefully a company will release genuine episodes as opposed to these public domain ripoffs."
positive,"Urban Primitive Spiritualism: This is long overdue. Most people get only so far along in the Modern Primitive scene without ""going native"". Here is a book that gives excellent and easily followed guidelines for anyone who wants more from their experiences as a Modern Primitve. Combining Piercings, Humor and Good Spirituality, this is a great buy."
positive,Alaska sourdough: REad most of the book while visiting my brother in Alaska. Loved it. I am going to be making my sourdough starter soon. Book is full of great stories and recipes.
positive,"I bought my wife a Cadillac: This bike is well built, with top grade components. You get bang for your money. I ended up buying two of them, one for the wife and one for the daughter who rides with us quite a bit. They both love their bikes. it was simple to assemble, although I did have a very experineced cycler helping me. The ride is smooth and the gears work like a dream. It is a bit on the heavy side perhaps but for my two ladies, it will be all they need for some time until their skill level truly expands."
negative,"THIS BOOKS STINKS: I didn't like this book it was way to confusing, i don't think teachers should make kids read this book it is definantly not a kids kinda book."
positive,"BAND OF GOLD: Band of Gold takes the viewer into the world of prostitution, and what drives women into that life. As murders begin to occur many fingers are pointed toward many individuals, from those on high to those one step from the gutter. I felt such a sense of pity for these ladies, but admired their fortitude and how they were so loyal to each other. I look forward to additional series."
negative,Dude where's the funny?: This movie is not funny.Don't waste your money.I would love to give it 0 stars but apparently I have to give to give it at least one.
positive,"Awesome DVD: I enjoyed the first DVD and haven't viewed the second one yet. But still, the first DVD is awesome and worth the purchase."
positive,"The classic tale of the war that never happened.: I think this was the novel that made Clancy famous, and if correct then rightfully so. Red Storm Rising is the story of a conflict between the Soviet Union and NATO over oil, after terrorists strike at Russian Oil production. NATO is seen as the major obstacle to the conquest of the middle eastern oil fields, so it must be taken out first. The main action of the book revolves around the taking of Iceland by Soviet paratroopers brought in by ferry, and they efforts of the United states to take the island back. There is plenty of action described in Central Europe and other areas as well, as the friction of war and unexpected resistance slow the Soviet advance. This book is not as well written as Clancy's later books, but is still a good read and of interest to anyone who asks the question, what if America and the Soviet Union had actually clashed head to head in the late twentieth century."
positive,"A Colourful Link Between Humans and Wolves: I have read many of Farley Mowat's books, yet this one gave me a different opinion about this storyteller. Before I had always thought of him as being frankly,quite a boring man. Yet when I picked up this book in my English Literature class, I was surprised when I continued to read on. His descriptons are colorful and keep you informed. He keeps it interesting and lively. He combines fact with his imagination. What the result is, is a stunning realization away from the fairytale wolf. I would recommend you read the book for he plays with your emotions as will any good author. He makes you laugh and cry and smile within almost every chapter. A fantastic example of Farley Mowats distinctive storytelling style."
positive,be careful with size: Great boot. Seems like it ran large. I usually wear a size 9 athletic shoe and sandal but this 9 swallowed my foot whole. Maybe it's becasue my foot is a bit narrow. No trouble returning and swapping for an 8 1/2. Solestruck is an excellent company to deal with. Great customer service!!I love these boots!
negative,"MISLEADING/FALSE PRODUCT ADVERTISEMENT: I am a little confused. The camera I ordered that was advertised online, is not the camera I recieved via UPS. I was aware that the camera might not come in the color advertised. But it was certainly suppose to come in the same style. (The Minolta Freedom 70 QD Date 35mm Camera) Instead, I recieved a Minolta Freedom Zoom 70ex.What happened? I did recieve the camera bag at no extra charge. Thank you. But my concern is not recieving the camera I ordered!"
positive,"Tested and top rated in my book!: I ride between 70 and 100 miles per week. I wanted to buy a computer, but didn't want to spend too much money. I read the reviews and chose the Topeak Comp 140. The reality is I couldn't be happier. I have done some field test riding beside my car and the speed was right on the money. I can now track everything I want to know about my ride. The instructions were a little difficult to understand (not to mention very small), but I searched online and found the same directions in pdf. { http://topeak.com/sub/documents/M-TPC5-GB-5-05.pdf } This gave me the ability to zoom them into focus and see them clearly, box by box, making instillation a breeze. If you are in the market for a good computer, I recommend this one without reservation. The price is more than fair and the performance is exceptional."
positive,"Highjinks that Never Grow Old: I first saw this 20 years ago on an independent TV station and loved it. It is too bad that they do not include this installment with the other ""Carry On"" movies in the fine collection that they put out a few years agoThe Carry On Collection. Frankie Howerd, Jim Dale, and Kenneth Williams are exceptionally funny. I loved Jim Dale as Dr. Killmore wooing a medical school skeleton in his office."
negative,"Bali No: Los Angeles' Wondermints worship at the altar of Brian Wilson. In fact, they were his back-up band for his recent tour performing Pet Sounds in its entirety. Bali is more Beach Boys Love You than Pet Sounds, an acquired taste of strained whimsy that will either thrill you or work your last nerve, depending wholly on your mood. When in said mood, I admire the kicky ""Arnoldo Said"" and ""My Id/Entity"", the Association-like back-up vocals of ""Sting o' Luv"", the very-Who ""Riot Grrls R Go"", and the aptly titled ""In and Around Greg Lake"". As for the rest, after seven or eight plays, I can't remember any of it."
positive,Great guide for anyone undergoing infertility treatments: Dr. Marrs' Fertility Book is a handy reference for couples who may be experiencing infertility. Dr. Marrs clearly explains the various procedures used to determain the cause(s) of infertility. He also provides detailed explainations on the various treatments used to try and acheive pregnancy. Dr. Marr's book has answered many of my questions as I work through my own infertility issues. I highly recommend this book as a handy reference for anyone who is being treated for infertility.
positive,a true classic: half way thru. a great read and a joy to read on kindle. there were a couple of times that I wondered if there were sections missing.
negative,I have not received the magazine yet and am wondering when it will come.: I am a little upset that I have not recieved the first issue of the magazune
negative,"Great book poor Kindle transfer.: This is very significant treatise on first principles. However the Kindle version is irritatingly sloppy. Poor format, poor transfer, - at times only the context of the scrambled ""word"" will reveal the actual word Bradley wrote. I hope my friends at Amazon will redo this text and notify those of us who purchaed it that a faithful copy is now available."
negative,"Lead causes cancer!: These memorex keyboards are okay. The hot keys won't work unless you install the software on to your computer, but the software is memory resident. So it becomes just another program that eats up your system resources. Also for some reason, memorex decided to put lead as a conductor in the keyboards cord, so you run the risk of getting lead poisoning each and every time you touch the cord. You will see a warning to this effect on the cord itself.That alone is enough of a reason to stay away from Memorex keyboards! Even though Memorex does make cordless keyboards, they lost me as a customer due to their reckless use of lead in their products.Not worth the money, not even if it was free. Buy another brand of keyboard. Lead can cause cancer, so enough said."
negative,"Nauseatingly sugar-sweet: Ulch, can we say ""boy band""? As much as I like Clay's voice, I have to say the complete opposite for this CD. With cheesy titles like ""I Will Carry You"" and ""No More Sad Songs"", this album screams ""teeny-bopper dream come true"". I've listened to each track a few times in hopes of maybe hearing something different and/or enjoyable, but no chance. 1 star."
negative,"Do not buy if seal is broken: Imagine my dismay when I, much like a wide-eyed little girl on Christmas Day, eagerly unscrewed the cap to my very first container of Uranium Ore only to discover...that it had millipedes crawling around in it. Hundreds of them. And they're all radioactive, so of course they're each about as big as my cat. And with TWICE the legs. No thanks to you, Uranium Ore Inc, I have to knit god knows how many millipede snow booties. I mean...I have to. They're my pets now. They'll probably vomit radioactive bile all over me if I don't appease them.Plus, as soon as I got this thing in the mail, the Libyans were all over me. And I gotta knit snow booties for THEM now."
positive,Rating my purchases.: Rating my purchases. I love the Laptop. Also the movies were great. This is why I don't hardly do ratings. Too time consuming.
positive,"NIGHTMARES: YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW SCARY LOOKING THE PICTURES ARE IN ALL OF THE BOOKS!!!! THAT COULD DEFINETELY GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES FOR A WHILE.EVEN IN SOME STORIES. THERE WAS NOT A PICTURE OF THE WENDINGO, BUT THE BACK OF THE BOOK SAID IT WAS A FEMALE SPIRIT, AND/OR A CANNIBAL GIANT THAT KILLS FOR HUMAN FLESH AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS DESCRIBED INDIANS WANTING TO EAT FLESH AS A ""WENDIGO PSYCHOSIS"". {I'm sure that's how you spell that word}."
negative,"Hun, Clay is sooooo lame: Hun, the CD is nothing special. It is not an essential CD like the Beatles, Supremes, or Aretha. He will be a one CD hit wonder huns."
negative,"Drowning in the stuff: I, a techno fan, hate it. My two best friends, who are avid blues fans, hate it. The songs drag on forever. In fact, the only good thing about this album is the Bodyrock. An Moby's shiny little head."
negative,"waste of money: the kit doesnt even fit the heater outlet vent on the 75K btu model. half the parts you wont need, just go to a hardware store & buy the ones you need for half the price."
negative,"Disappointing, not helpful for traders at all: A few years ago I redHow To Make Money In Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or Bad, 3rd Editionwhich was one of the best books on investing in stocks I've ever red. The author of that book mentionned he had over 2,000 books in his investment library with only a few very good books. He gave a list of 10 books he found best, which I've all red. Most of them were very good books (certainly for someone like me with some 150 books on investing). Books likeHow I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock MarketorReminiscences of a Stock Operator (Wiley Investment Classics)were all superb books. This was one of only books I had not red from the list. So I ordered it and began reading it with high expectations. As you can see in my rating, I did not like it all. To be honest I find the whole book one mess. I cannot even imagine how anyone could get anything useful for his/her trading out this book. I don't have a clew why O'Neill liked this one so much."
negative,"Dissapointing: I'm a huge Stephen King fan, so I always read his works expecting something great about him.And the begining of this novel certainly proved to be amusing and entertaining, but it all drifts after chapter 1, ending in an odd mix of characters and non-sense arguments.Very weak and dissapointing."
negative,"disappointing and naive: Basically I agree with John Clute's assessment of this novel. Mr. Gardner is a fine writer, but has a knack for using really dumb sociobiological explanations. Let us hope he has mulled through consequences when writing COMMITMENT HOUR. He deserves another chance."
positive,Great family movie: Ordered this for the grandkids and they love it....Thanks Amazon for your prompt shipment.....Enjoy doing business with Amazon....they make the whole process so easy.
positive,"We meet Nero and Archie: The first in a genius series, but it doesn't matter whether you read this series in order or not, Rex Stout masterfully makes each new book stand on it's own. You come to love these characters and can follow the series wherever you pick it up. I have read every Nero Wolfe more than once over the years, I now happily am re-reading them. This one is superb."
negative,"Waste of money: Why can't we give ""0 stars""? No insightful content. Self-important name-dropping. I felt cheated out of my $20+ for a book saying, ""Retirement is about more than money."""
positive,"This is a MUST have!!!: We purchased this swingset for our 2 year old and he absolutely LOVES it! We love the fact that it is durable and safe. When our older son who is not 14 years old was little, we tried the fancy wooden fort type swingset andthe only thing we accomplished was spending a lot of money because the wood cracked and within 2 years it was junk. This swingset was made to last and will be around for a long time I think."
negative,"Save your money; save your time: I almost burst out laughing reading the review above:""Eisenberg's arc through life could be used to define the baby boom.In the 1970s, he coined the term power lunch;in the 1980s, he edited Esquire and invented rotisserie baseball. In the 1990s, he wrote books on finding the good life through golf and fishing, and at the end of the decade, he joined an Internet retailer.""Stupid me for thinking this man would something about retirement and money!And, what little research I did tonight online shows- he did not coin the term power lunch- he did not invent Rotisserie baseballThis book is boring. This book is highly overrated. Save your money and save your time."
negative,"Cheaply made.: All during the first year of use (3 hrs./wk.) the music would mysteriously cut off. The company, AO Safety, was no help-they never returned e-mails. So in frustration I pried them apart and with a multi-tester found that the switch-a cheap little pressed together thing, was bad. I'm no electronic wizard, but have taken apart and fixed many things, and I gotta tell you, these things are cheaply made and flimsy. I wish I could recommend a better brand, but I've never had any others. I guess you get what you pay for. They were so cool when yhey worked, though, and I'll probably spend more here at Amazon on a better brand."
positive,"Oh, the Memories...: God, I loved this show!! It's a fun, wild look at the ""old west"" sterotypical style. ""Crazy Cat"" is the best. Real Native Americans were cast, which back then, was a first. Ken Berry gives a great performance of the bumbling captain. Worth the wait!"
negative,"wrong item twice: Ordered an antenna the middle of Nov, 05. Received wrong item with in 10 days. I let them aware of problem then I mailed back wrong item. Within 14 days I received duplicate of wrong item. After I emailed them to let them know of problem, I heard nothing. I had to send an ugly email, stating ""what's up?"". They cancelled my order, then refunded original amount charged to credit card, plus .11 cents. Still fighting for them to reimburse me for my cost to send back 2 wrong items."
negative,"Good Cd BUT...: I got this CD using Pepsi Stuff Points. The case was cracked when it arrived but the CD was okay. Good tunes, lowsey delivery service..."
negative,"cropped, vhs-scan ...: I'm a Point Break fan. It's one of the best ""bad"" movies out there, so I was pumped when it finally came out on DVD. Unfortunately, it is a total ..... Everyone loves to watch their favorite movies in letterbox, because it gives you the opportunity to view the full movie as opposed to the scan made to fit the VHS format. In the case of Point Break however the letterbox format was achieved by cropping the top and bottom off of the vhs scan. So, not only do you not get the full feature film, you don't even get the VHS view of the film. It's claustrophobic. There are scenes in this DVD that don't even makes sense, parts of people's faces are cut off. DO NOT BUY THIS [junk]!!! The picture is sharp, but it's like watching the movie through a keyhole!!!"
positive,"Well done: I have been a fan for years, and was pleasantly surprised by this documentary.To see how many other rock musicians were influenced by Rush was surprising."
positive,"Finally some new QoTSA: It took me 5 or 6 times to really get in the flow of this album, but after I let go of the fact that's it's quite different from their previous efforts, I'm finding a breadth of familar Queens and some great new sounds. The excellent lyrics and vocals of Tangled Up In Plaid and Broken Box, and the catchy guitar riffs of In My Head and Little Sister are just some of what I've dug so far. Good stuff."
negative,Kindle errors: The sample eBook for the Kindle starts out with part of the first sentence missing. Is this indicative of the remaining parts of the Kindle book? Waiting for a response from Amazon.com.
negative,"Kit to fix the problem is not that available easily: I tried online 'live'support and asked for the kit to fix the ""out of paper"" problem, but they put me through a bunch of questions about it that took so long that I ran out of time. It does not seem to be as simple as contacting them and having them send out a kit."
positive,Fun: Never read the book before and enjoyed. Since it's free I guess I could live with the slight editing issues.
negative,"Interesting at first but goes nowhere.: I read this book a few years ago and the it still stays with me. Not in the way a work of art does, but more like a piece of bad roast you had at that hillbilly bar. It was supposed to be dead but you thought to yourself ""O MY GOD, it's still moving!"" Anyway, I couldn't care less for the characters and the plot (all 100 of them) was horrible. To make a long story short, it ended up in the recycle bin."
positive,"Stuff Blows Up REAL GOOD!! - Stop being so hard on Vin: Wow, people were expecting Vin Diesel to do Hamlet?? Its VIN DIESEL for goodness sakes! This film promises explosions, hoochies, Vin D. wisecracks and a little plot. That is exactly what you get. Anybody see the latest Bond film? I don't see any real difference between XXX and Die Another Day; even the stunts were just as ""Xtreme"". I had a good time watching this film, isn't that the point?"
negative,"One of my least favorite King books: I guess I am one of the minority of those who reviewed this book, but I didn't care for it at all. I have been reading King for 20 years, and while I have my favorites (The Stand, Christine, Pet Sematary) I have never before disliked one of his books. I was very disappointed in this effort by him. Hopefully his next book will be more like the King we know and love."
positive,"So sad when it ended......: I loved this book. I like most of Philippa Gregory's books but this is, by far, my favorite. You really feel like you know every character. She does a good job of making you feel for each of them and see their side of things. A lot of people critizing for historical inaccuracies but this is a historical FICTION book, not everything in it is said to be true. It is loosely based on a true historical event. I definitely recommend this book."
positive,"Most important popular philosophical/theological book of the 20th century.: I first read this book in 1967 when I was 17 years old. It clarified my doubts, enlightened and challenged me.I would say it made me largely the man I am today.I reread it just recently, and found it as wonderful and insightful as I did all those years ago.I recommend it to anyone who is curious about their spiritual journey."
positive,"Pretty Cool Monkey Tish: If you are a zombie fan than this is for you. The songs are different enough that it's like listening to some new tunes, but you will still be familiar with it."
positive,"Great convience for the price!!!!: Product arrived on time, (a little early actually---which is a good thing, :-); intact, & in excellent condition. This bed includes an ""in mattress inflation motorized pump"" that makes for ease of use, and much quieter inflation application in comparison to external pump air mattresses. It is comfortable, and an extremely good value for the price!!! Will purchase this product again!!!"
negative,"ZooTycoon: Zoo Tycoon is a great idea and has lots of potental. Beware of trouble. Its is not very compatible with all computer systems. There are alot of software conflicts that I have come across. Tech support is so-so from Microsoft for this game. They always blamed it on the computer and its software that was preloaded. What's so funny is that my new DELL computer is preloaded with Microsoft software. The troubles I am referring to are lock-ups, freezing and slowness of game prior to locks-ups/freezing. Microsoft needs to fix the problems with software conflicts especially when its their software that is the conflict. Graphics and the ideas of the game are great."
negative,"Hunting Badger: This is my first Hillerman book, and it will also be my last. I put it down after enduring 125 pages. I am not sure what the problem was, but it never really grabbed hold of me. The book seemed to just meander along without any real bite."
positive,"Very motivational: If you have breath in your body, you need to read this book. If God gave you breath then he gave you spiritual gifts as well and wants you to use them.The author of this book gives a balanced account of spiritual gifts, what they are, how to know if you have them, and how to develop them. This book is like ""one-stop-shopping"" for everything you need to know about spiritual gifts. The author pulls on his extensive background in biblical studies to write authoritatively about his subject. But his tone is conversational and easier to read than many other books on the subject, and it's never condescending. He includes some interesting anecdotes.I especially enjoyed the Spiritual Gifts Inventory at the end."
positive,"Unputdownable!: This is the first Mark Morris novel I've read and I'm definitely looking forward to reading more! After reading the 'blurb' on the book cover I wondered if it was going to be a kind of 'Friday 13th' style story...where characters are picked off one by one...but it's much, MUCH better than that.The characters were very easy to identify with, set in 'my world' which made it all the more scary. Morris builds up the suspense wonderfully and almost carries it off right to the end of the book. The ending was a bit 'Scooby Doo-ish', but wouldn't stop me recommending it."
positive,"works: came a day ahead of expected ( THE MORNING AFTER HURRICANE SANDY) and i live on long island !!! and it works 100% fine, VERY long cable"
positive,"works fine: I have an 'old' ibook from 2001, white, and even though it says for G4 on the package of the charger, it works just fine with mine. I actually like it better than the original one from Mac, smaller and somewhat handier. Glad I didn't have to pay 80$ to fix that ! :-)"
positive,"An extremely useful book on writing for students.: I'm aghast that this invaluable book has received only a single review, and a poor one at that. My high school freshman English class used this book, and I still have my copy a decade and a half later. It's the single most useful book I've read on writing fundamentals, and I recommend it highly to those who are actually interested in learning to write. There has never been any point in trying to achieve a personal style before mastering the fundamentals of logical organization and tight writing.Some of the examples, perhaps, could use a little updating, but the fundamentals of good writing have not changed appreciably since the book was published. I've learned a lot about writing since high school, of course (I now write professionally), but I can't imagine any better book for teaching the basics."
negative,Not Impressed: I was given a single cup Keurig for Christmas as a gift. I got it because my niece had one and absolutely LOVED the coffee it made. I tried the samples that came with the pot but none of them impressed me. I love Tim Horton's coffee and bought the extra filter to use the TH coffee grounds. Still not impressed. My Mr. Coffee has given me a better cup than the Keurig. I tried a coffee press this morning and even that is better than the Keurig. I'm returning the Keurig. Disappointed. I was hoping for a better cup of coffee. I have one cup a day and that cup needs to be as good as it can be.
negative,"Sickly Sweet: There's a fine line between the embodiment of beauty and the chocolate box. The higher the stakes, the more unpalatable the pale charicture reveals itself to be. This album is far from Damon & Naomi's earlier incandescent incarnation as ""Pierre Etoile"" and the results are disappointing. It's a rather cloying and saccharine set of takes on the ""sweet tune"" with old-school instrumentation that seeks to contrive wholesomeness but ultimately basks in naivité. There are slightly more engrossing tracks towards the end, but listening to Big Star's original version of ""Blue Moon"" on the heels of Damon & Naomi's neutered cover will highlight just how lacking this whole project is."
negative,"disappointed: The quality of the printing in this book is terrible. I can barely read it and can not tell anything from the pictures. I am also disappointed because Amazon does not offer the chance to read some of the pages to see what a book has. I want a book about trees that gives details about the trees and their characteristics, so that I can pick the trees for my situation."
negative,Tepid: Ugh. Makes your estomac (stomach) twist-and-turn. Halfway through this album will make you regret that you've bought this album for 14.99!!!!! Crap :-(
negative,"""A Guide"" -- but not much of one: A poor, incomplete and unwieldy reference. ""Modern American Usage"" fails to deal with many of the everyday issues people struggle with in their writing -- the list of omissions is long and varied -- and those that are included are sometimes addressed with a lack of thoroughness or clarity. Too often, and too irritatingly, entries merely redirect users to other headings, when the issue could easily have been resolved under the original entry-heading. Those involved in creating this edition seem not to appreciate that a little duplication goes a long way in making what is, first and foremost, a craftsperson's tool user-friendly."
positive,"Nice light car: This car has so many possiblities. We pretend to haul gravel or cement or dirt or asphalt or grain or coal. We help build roads, or feed animals or make deliveries.The best part, though, is how light the car is. When we use the BRIO Autostop and Start Engine (33222) we can easily put 4-5 of these cars behind it and still have the engine pull up a hill. The under-powered engine can only handle 2-3 of the heavier cars going uphill.We use these little cars a lot. They're definitely a nice addition to our train set."
positive,"I love it: I love this thing. This is the third I've bought over 8 years. There is a warranty but ive never used it. That is my only negative-if a hair gets sucked through the back it can short the system. It's great for someone who is not talented enough to hold a blowdryer and a brush. So I just flip my head over and run it through. You wont get stick straight hair like a Straightener will do, but for my curly hair, it comes out great!"
positive,Excellent!!!: Excellent for fans of Michael Caine and Julie Walters. An enjoyable classic. Finely written and wonderfully acted. Shot entirely on Location in Dublin Ireland; primarily at Trinity College.
positive,"Inspirational, but needs more: I truly enjoyed this movie, but would have liked it to be a little more detailed. It seemed to jump from one scene to another too quickly. The acting was done very well and Sergio Castellitto, protrayed Padre Pio very much like himself. I have already watched it in its entirety about four times. And I still get emotional each time."
positive,"Good examples and helpful hints: I bought this book after i failed to get the score i needed in the TOEFL exam, and it helped me a lot at the second time I did the test. The best part about it is the CD-ROM that has 4 complete tests so you can practice just like if you were doing the real Computer Based TOEFL Test. It helps you to get in the mood of the test so you are prepared when you take the real test. There is only one thing that should be enhanced in this book. The review and hints at the ""writing test part"" are not enough. There should be more essay examples. Over all, this is the book you have to buy if you are planning to pay just for one book to prepare for the TOEFL"
negative,Bad Product--great company. Responded immediately to problem with product.: The product was defective. Could not be cranked down. Bolts were missing from package. The company offered to replace and shipped me the missing bolts. I reccomend the company but not this jack.
positive,"Great Action Adventure!: A top notch crew does a wonderful job of bringing the essence of Isaac Asimov's robot stories to life. The acting and directing are great, even more amazing considering that much of the filming was done using blue-screen backgrounds and stand-ins for the robots, who were created later using computer generated figures. Bridget Moynahan pulled off her role brilliantly. She became a scientist involved in a puzzling crime, instead of looking like a strident feminist or a hot bod mouthing lines she didn't understand. Will Smith was amazing and fluid as always. Even the minor (human) characters sparkled."
negative,"Worked Fine, Then Stopped Working: Pros: It does what it's supposed to - keeps drinks warm.Cons: The warming surface is a little small, doesn't fit wider mugs. Mine stopped working after a month, and I'm not sure why. It may not be spill proof, because I got some coffee on top... perhaps it shorted somehow?Bottom line: OK, but might be a better one out there..."
negative,"Long and boring: I can summarize why I didn't like this movie pretty quickly. It was long and boring, and the antichrist wasn't born until about the end of the movie, and then it was over. Nothing really interesting really happened. I felt like it was a waste of time. If you want a good movie about the incarnation of the antichrist, what The Omen, it's much more worth the time."
positive,"Racial.: A good look at police power gone wrong. The sheriff looks out for his buddies with little concern for his clients, the county citizens. It also shows the ugly face of racism in this case also the criminal actions of the Clan aka the KKK. I'd recommend all Southern Rednecks to watch this movie and learn from it. Lots of brutality. Carlton Heston as the city of Dalton's Patriarch did a superb job. It's a good movie for a broad adult audience. Don't expect the viewing quality of today's DVD's tho. It's been, as good as possible, formatted from VHS onto DVD."
negative,"Not what I ordered: The statue pictured is not what the recipient got! I wish that this company would show exactly what they are shipping, not what is pictured here. I will not order from this company again."
positive,Boots and Saddles: The book arrived in perfect condition and was a gift for my daughter who has been getting it through her local library. She reinacts Libby Custer so needs this book as a resource often and is thrilled to now have her own copy. I purched it through Amazon in order to use the super saver shipping and because it would arrive by the date it was needed.
positive,"Identical(?) to ASIN B000008B9R: Hodges & Davis were great, and I wish more of their stuff were readily available. But this one appears to be a duplicate of ""In a Mellow Tone"". It has the same two artists and the same track list as ASIN B000008B9R. (Damn. And there were so few albums of these guys as it was!)"
negative,"The apple falls far from the tree: I can only guess that youthful rebellion drove Carlton, whose dad is country music legend Charlie, to take up reggae. Inexplicably, he even sings in a Jamaican accent. This is pretty thin and embarrassing stuff: Carlton's voice couldn't be less distinctive; the cookie cutter songs are rarely more than half-written. There is little here to interest country or reggae fans."
positive,"a good book: This technology module contains a brief introductory description to the exchanger type above, followed by information on construction, construction materials, operating limitsand principal applications. Where appropriate, a comparison is made with conventionalshell and tube heat exchangers to emphasise size and weight reductions that can beachieved by using compact heat exchangers.The Module 3 series present further information applicable to all technologies, such asgeneral advantages and limitations of compact exchanger designs, common applications,fouling and how to minimise it, energy efficiency. heat transfer enhancement, exchangerselection, specification and operation, process intensification and software programmes."
negative,Not appropriate for those with good taste.: Although this movie had a lot of potential it was far from reaching that potential. The sound track used Rap music that was full of nasty langauge and poor moral messages. There were totally inappropriate scenes that added absolutely nothing to the movie except perhaps offend peoples sensitivities. This movie is definately not for youger members of the family. My opinion is to just let this movie fade into the dirt where it belongs.
positive,"Shawty Yeah: I don't buy much rap any more these days unless they are classic albums from the sure shot artists, but these Youngblood cats have definitely reached me. This whole cd is strong from start to finish, its on of the albums you sit can sit and listen to or be in da club Shakin Em off....I was highly pleased with this purchase....85 is my favorite track when i'm ridin but if i'm in dat booty club i wanna here Shake em off"
positive,"Great Christmas Classic: I used to watch ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" every year as a child and now my kids love to watch it. Even now, I'll sit and watch it with them-anytime of year. More importantly, this Christmas story emphasizes the true meaning of Christmas-something I'm happy to have my children watching."
positive,Lots of Diapers: You definitely get a a ton of diapers with this purchase and the price is pretty good when other retailers aren't having diaper sales. The diapers keeps my baby dry especially over night.
positive,"Best game ever: This games makes even amazing games like starcraft and warcraft redundant. Warhammer has it all and does it better than anyone else. Truly great game, total fun, great combat, graphics, races, units, a pleasure to play."
negative,"Alright...: With The Lord of the Rings comming out I picked up The Hobbit about three weeks ago and tried to read it. I thought I would be able to at least get to The Fellowship of the Ring so I could try to go see the movie this Christmas break (I'm a pretty fast reader for a fourteen year old girl). However I'm just reaching page 250 in this book and though everyone promised me it would get interesting I'm still waiting.I find Bilbo an interesting character but quite frankly he didn't pull at me like characters such as Harry Potter and Novalee Nation. And Gandalf annoyed me more than I can express. Though I'm not finished with the book, I must say I hope that The Fellowship of the Ring is plenty better."
positive,"I loved this book.: This story of a Cantonese family in Hong Kong is filled with warmth and humor. It tracks the relationship between Wallace, a clever young man of Portuguese-Cantonese descent, and the family's shrewd, miserly, tyrannical patriarch. Perhaps it's a bit of a fairy tale that works out too smoothly in the end. But Mo writes so well about families - and is so good at capturing the magic of people finding somewhat unexpectedly that they love each other - that it doesn't matter. The scenes between Wallace and his surprisingly resourceful wife May Ling -- and between Wallace and his beloved nephews -- are simply a joy to read."
negative,"disappointed with this MP3: I purchased this MP3 player as a Christmas gift for our daughter only to find out on Christmas Day that is not compatible without our computer despite every update available. While we could see the preloaded video and it is very clear and bright, we were never able to upload any music. My husband (who is computer wizard) spent 12 hours trying to get this thing to work, but without any success. Next time we'll buy an IPod."
negative,"Don't over cook!: I had just received this Garlic roaster and couldn't wait to try it. I followed the directions and instead of putting in in the microwave for 5-6 minutes, I put it in for only 4 minutes. The smoke started pouring out of the microwave vent and the entire head of garlic was coal black and the roaster was ruined. A friend told me to try only 1 1/2 minutes and, although the roaster now has a burnt smell, I tried it for that time only. The garlic turned out soft and usable, except I will now have to replace the roaster with a new one. Whoever wrote the directions couldn't have been further off with the timing. Just be careful! I would probably cut down the oven time to 30 minutes instead of the recommended time, also."
positive,"Good deep water movie to own: I really like the graphics of this movie. It was made well and can even live up the standards of todays high graphic movies. It was full of suspense, action, and drama. I enjoyed especially the special effects that were done. Its one to own and have as one's collection. A+ movie"
negative,"Not old Peter Gabriel: Being a big fan of Peter Gabriel from the days of his first solo album, I don't know where he wanted to go with this record.It appears to be a fusion of popular '80s style music and 'world music'. Not only does this not work, it actually got on my nerves. Perhaps many other people find this enjoyable, but for my money Security is the best buy. It brings new musical ideas to mind without forcing the listener to accept a new style of music that may not be pleasing to the western ear."
positive,"Pure art in sight, sound and motion. JDJ as the Velvet One.: This is a highly entertaining show that you can watch over and over again. It deserves an Amazon.com double five star rating, it is that good. Think, if you will, of the Velvet One's rising to the top in spite of her talented and tabloid catching siblings and in spite of the emergence of girl groups who are flooding the airwaves and CD displays with soundalike claptrap which has only a catchy phrase or a man-slam to its merit. (Pay some dues, girls.) Look at the Velvet One's performance in the concert showstoppers--""Alright/I Get Lonely/Rope Burn"" ""Black Cat"" ""What About That"" ""Rhythm Nation""--I mean...is she great or what? And look at how many of the Velvet One's tunes you know by heart. There ain't that many performers out there of Janet's calibre at all these days...well, maybe a few of 'em. They seem to be calling themselves ""diva"". Oh well. Thanks, Velvet One, from saving us from an entertainment void."
negative,"Borrow it.: Lance Armstrong has the funniest scene in this movie, and that's no strike at the pedaler. It is legitimately funny. Other funny shizzle:1) Numerous shots to the bathing suit parts (Immature? Yes. Always funny? Yes.)2) A bar is named after something disgusting/funny/disgusting again.3) Vince Vaughn occasionally reminds you that his dry wit still exists.4) The blooper scene with the ref--""Laughing really ....""5) The ""alternate"" ending.All told, this list comprises roughly three and one half minutes of the movie. After the tag-team debacle that is Starsky-->Dodgeball, it will be difficult for me to go see another heavily pimped Stiller production.""Laughing the whole movie...""""Funniest movie I've ever seen...""""Non-stop hilarity...""?"
negative,Pure dog poop.: Don't waste your money like I did. Kathie Lee was a hottie but her CD sucks! They should use this CD for drive people crazy. The help me look at the world like Jesus song (track #7)almost made me crash my car.
negative,"Totally Disappointed: 1. Totally different finish color from the picture addressed. Actually, it looks cheap.2. Its finish quality is poor. Very rough and sharp plastic edge. I don't want my kid use it. It may hurt fingers.3. It has unstable vibration and noise. I feel very unstable, cheap and light..."
negative,"Dry Treatment of an Uninteresting Plot: This movie drags. The plot moves slowly. It is typical of movies with an inverted hero, the treatment of the subject is neither innovative nor exciting.The high point is seeing Pee-Wee Herman, Bobcat Goldthwait, and that 21 Jump Street guy doing a hit of coke, all together, off a bar while girls in bikinis play in the pool.Depp struggles with an amusing, forced, and marginal Boston accent. He seems to have copped it by watching Good Will Hunting about six times. He should have watched it six or eight more times.But, yeah, that triumverate of acting talent doing a line, that's about the high point. The soundtrack is great, and the audio is well produced. But it's not an entertaining movie, or even a well-told story."
negative,"Poor book: Dear Sirs,When I have ordered the book I thought it will be excellent sourse for me before studing some particular topic. But I was disapointed when I read it from the very begining. It is simply poor. African architecture is very rich. It is hard to imagine how the author could write such a poor book. Photos are also not very good. Everyone who understand and can ""read"" arcitecture would write that there is not enough information even on the subjects which are described in the book.I would say this book should cost less."
negative,"Epic. If You Mean Epically Bad.: I hated Cadillac Records but I stayed with it for the soundtrack and the hope that it would get better. Len Chess isn't the only paternalistic thing about this film. A mishmash timeline of race cliches and lazy storytelling, Cadillac Records can't even be bothered to get it's facts straight. Saving it from one star are the performances of Columbus Short, Mos Def and Eamonn Walker, all of whom are far better than the material deserves. The film provides about as much context as a 1950's Looney Tunes featuring celebrities of the day. Even if one allows for the need to condense a large story into a short time frame, have some continuity of character inside the abbreviated version. Disjointed, relying on race role tropes instead of characterization, Cadillac Records is a lazy film that does a disservice to all whom it portrays."
positive,This is the best CD that i have ever had.: This CD is awesome!! I listen to it everyday and love every song on it
positive,"Babar, My Childhood movie: This movie is great for bringing back memories from my childhood. It's also a quality children's story. Maybe a little scary at parts, but definitely a great movie. The DVD itself is in great shape, I would recommend buying from this seller."
negative,Beware - offensive language: A private investigator tries to solve the question of who murdered Ellen Dahl.For mature readers only because of very vulgar language.
negative,Doesn't last: Bought this as a Christmas gift in 2011. There are only 2 of us in the house.We have used it only 4 or 5 times. Today I went to use it and it will not heat up. What a waste of money
negative,"Disappointing sound quality: I bought the Pico for my wife, and was pretty excited to put it to use on a recent long car ride, but I was very disappointed in the sound quality. After following the directions closely (being careful to tune to a channel that was indeed empty static) the music came through, but the frequency response seemed truncated on both the high and low ends. We also noticed that unless we placed the transmitter in a couple of select (and somewhat inconvenient) locations, the signal was somewhat crackly. Overall I'm disappointed, although if you have low expectations for sound quality, this product might be for you."
positive,"A Wonderful Classic: Quite simply, this is one of the best fantasy novels available. This version of the book is actually a bit better than the one I grew up with. There are a few illustrations, but not much else that you wouldn't expect. Now I just need to watch the movie to see if they were able to do justice to this classic piece of literature."
negative,Materpiece that needs an overhall: faded color and millions of artifacts are only some of the problems this DVD. Hopefully it will be remastered soon!
negative,"a disgrace to religion: although this book was an intentional attack on organized religion of the past, i thought that it went to far in trying to humor the audience. In light of this book being fiction, Pratchett still wanders a little far into even joking about something that is as important to millions of people as a supreme power.even so, the comedy good throughout. the characters were a little shallow at times, and my own obsession with imagery in fantasy novels (see Guy Gavriel Kay), made me feeling a bit disappointed in such a huge phenomenon as Terry Pratchett."
positive,"I LOVED this video: I have really had a great time with this video. I was concerned about it based on reviews I read, but I was wonderfully suprised. I found the aerobics section motivational and high energy. The streach section was simple in nature, but it really allowed me to push myself in the streaches to achieve maxium flexability. I have many of Jane's videos and this one is another favorite!"
positive,"Extravagant Book!: This book is awsome! It is the best book I've ever read! It is packed with so much adventure that if you put it down you just want to pick it back up again. It is very descriptive and full of suspense. It leaves you with unanswered questions that at the last minuet are answered, and they aren't answered in black and white. It is full of surprises and challenges so that when ever a character triumphs greatly he would also lose something. It leaves you sort of hanging at the end of the book but you have got a strong hold. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and suspense."
negative,Full of BS: I bought this book. I read it. I learned nothing. I just wasted my time for this BS book. Save your moneys. I tossed this book to the garbage instead of recycling or donating to the library because it is really suck! ...
positive,"Portable Canon Scanner Cartridge: This item has been the most durable piece to the little portable printer. Without it, one could not copy, scan, or save such scanned items to the hard drive for re-use. It has never failed, and it has been in use frequently since December 2001."
negative,"1. Something Good: I wanted to buy this song but couldn't figure out how to do it from the webpage. I don't have any problem buying Apple products, or ATT products or anyone else's products. But I could not figure out how to buy a song from Amazon."
negative,"Poor print of a wonderful film: My review is for issues with the DVD print, not the actual movie. In fact, I love this version of ""The Hobbit"" and watched it multiple times as a child. I purchased this DVD to refresh my memory of the movie and compare it to the book before seeing Peter Jackson's live-action version of the story. The story and animation hold up, but the print is ATROCIOUS. As other reviewers have stated: the print is too dark, the sound mix is terrible, and the picture jitters and skips. This print is nearly unwatchable, and that is such a pity because this film really is a classic and deserves better treatment."
positive,Big Help: I use the Second edition Fundamentals of Management book for my management class. I really like this and think that is helpful for people to understand the basic management principles and theroies. One thing that i have find very usefully in this boook is the exhibits. The exhibits have helped me understand more clearly different concepts that I would not of understood with out them. I also like the testing page that are found at the end of the chapters. They are a really big help in making sure I understand the main concepts that were covered in that certain chapter.I do plan on keeping this book after I have finished my class at the end of this semester. I will think that it will be an excellent source for me to use when I have started teaching.
negative,"Can You Say "" No Code "" ?: Allright, so Eddie, Stone, Jeff, Mike and Matt are no John, Paul, George and Ringo.. This album is a big dissapointment after listening to something as strong and sound-filled as ""Yield"". This reminds me of listening to No Code after having enjoyed ""Vitalogy"" as much as I did. Light Years and Insignificance are strong original PJ tunes, but the rest is fruitless.. I'd rate this album slightly higher than No Code, but not much. Too bad I bought PJ Tour tickets before I got a chance to listen to Binaural.. I'd be doing something else on Halloween otherwise."
positive,"All Night Long -: Jayne Ann Krentz has the gift of making you care about her characters, she also has always plot twists that keep you reading. This is romantic, light reading but with enough substance to give it meat.The plot is complicated but not impossible and makes an enjoyable winter's read."
positive,"Simply Gorgeous!: These are simply gorgeous and they feel like a high end product, very high quality! Beautiful lace! I love these thigh highs hosiery!"
negative,"Poor Sound & No Closed Captions or Subtitles: We gave this a good try. Watched the first episode twice and the second episode once. The sound quality just does not make it. We miss 15 to 20 percent of the dialog. It's a shame because this looks like a really good series. Poor sound quality seems to be a consistent problem with BBC productions. With the poor sound quality we really need the Closed Captioning or Subtitles. I have tried every setting on the Sony DVD player that I can find, but no Closed Captioning or subtitles. The box indicates that it has Closed Captioning, but I can't get it to work. Too bad!"
negative,"This Book Robs The Human Spirit Of Any Dimension: For some reason, people keep recommending this book as a romance. This book mocks romance with all the cold-blooded WASPy detachment of its setting. The only interesting thing about it was that there was a character with the same name as me, which is rare, but that's not a good enough reason for anyone else to read it."
positive,"Fun Read!: This book was a fun, quick read if you like question & answer advice. At times funny and kept me reading!"
positive,Enjoyable: Vanessa-Mae is a talented musician. The songs are varied going from classical to popular to standards. It's very enjoyable.
positive,MR WHOMP WHOMP!: Fiend is a southern tornato! KLC's Beats and Fiends flow put together is 2nd tightest on the tank only to mystikal and KLC. Fiends has much talent in this rap game. Fiend has shown that with time his game only gets tighter. I look very forward to the release of Fiends next release. Fiend has shown also that he's for sure just listen to his emotion in his rap. I praise him for that because many rappers today just rap to rap but Fiends puts 110% in all of his music thats why he is one of my fav's! Stay TRU Fiend
positive,"Simple but effective management ideas: A great and insightful resource for everyone - we all 'manage' others in our lives, especially moms and dads! Great management advice, grab a copy and pass it around work."
positive,"Still watching it...: I've only watched through the third episode, but so far it is better than Season 3. The gals are still making poor choices, but at least there are interesting character tidbits along the way."
negative,"They call him Hardly Knows-It: I didn't actually enjoy this book while I was reading it; although there were some parts that were interesting, a lot seemed very unbelievable.I was felt betrayed later, when I learned that Farley Mowat had written a HIGHLY fictionalized account of his experience, had spent very little time with the actual wolves and besides hadn't been there alone at all! I absolutely can't stand fiction being sold as ""an absolutely true account"" -- this crossed a line. And now that it has been revealed as fictionalized, it is truly astounding that it is still fooling people and is still being classes as nonfiction."
positive,"Awesome book!: Chris was at my school today. In the beginning, I went, yeah, yeah, yeah. By the end of the period I wanted to meet the author of my favorite book and ask him a question. I read Eragon twice over January and February. I had never met an author before.Awesome book!"
positive,"An American Classic that stands the test of time.: My father purchased Marty Robbin's orginal Gunfighter Ballads album in the early 1960s -- and I played it so many times I'm surprised the grooves in the record were not worn through. I still knew the words to over half the songs by heart, even though I hadn't heard any of them played in 30 years (at least). I can't tell you how happy it makes me to have this new CD available -- and hearing it in CD format instead of on my parent's old cabinet hi-fi system makes it even more of a treat!"
negative,"Don't take it apart and stick body parts inside the body of this beast!: There is a little metal tooth thing inside this monkey that looks like it wants you to touch it, but if you pry the top off with a wrench and stick body parts in there to touch it, you better be grounded buddy because you're in for the ride of your life. This thing must have a 87 jiggawatt capacitor in there or something because I blacked out and didn't wake up for 4 hours after touching it, and it wasn't even plugged in at the time. I can't stop blinking lately either. Be careful when dissecting this little tazer-wannabe!!!"
negative,"Dissapointment: I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit. This time, the same size, 6M did not fit, they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes, I looked inside my old shoes to find the size, I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful, just what I was looking for, but not a good fit."
positive,"such a cute book: I didn't have this one growing up, but think is so cute with a great message to be faithful to your word."
positive,"Great Introduction - A classic: This was one of the first Bellydance instructional videos on the market and I believe Atea did not have the in front of the camera experience and production assistance of many of the slicker more current videos/DVDs.Despite Atea's slightly stiff appearance and the somewhat dated aspects of this production, the essential information (and many of the bellydance fashions) are classic and have not changed very much at all. It is a great introduction to the dance, basic moves, history, and costuming."
positive,"Great for traveling: There may be better dictionaries to keep on the desk in your study, but they are impractical, because of their bulk, to bring with you when traveling. On the other hand, the so-called 'phrase books' put out by Berlitz and others are little more than worthless. This dictionary is the ideal compromise. It is small enough to fit into a tote bag, carryon, or backpack, yet inclusive enough to have just about any word you might need (except vulgar or 'dirty' words--those you'll have to learn from the locals). Of course, you'll need to know the basics of Spanish grammar, but this dictionary eliminates the need to rack your brain searching for a word. I have been using it in my travels to Latin countries since the 1990s. Highly recommended."
positive,"Goblet of Fire DVD: As with the other reviewers, I am a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter book series. That said, I also Loved Goblet of Fire. However, I was a bit disappointed. Of course, the movie could not include every bit of the story. But, they did great jobs on Alastor Moody. OK job on Victor Krum. One big disappointment was Fleur Delacour. In the book, she was supposedly part-Veela. The Fleur in the movie wasn't even all that pretty. Her hair wasn't waist-length and wasn't silver blond. Correcting this would not have made the movie any longer. If they had made the dragon task, as it was in the book, they could have time to add the hilarious bit at the Dursleys. Probably the most disappointing task was the maze. No magic was necessary in at all. And magic is the name of the game in these movies. It wouldn't have taken very much more time to add a monster or two to the maze. We saw Harry use ""Accio..."" twice. I doubt there was any more magic used. I hope ""Order of the Phoenix"" follows the magic!"
negative,Does not work as advertised: In theory this looks so easy to use. I bought it with very high expectations. I have tried to use it twice now and it certainly does not work as described in the instructions. The water turns blue within a couple of minutes and all the granules in the sprayer disappear within the first 5 mins. The instructions say that if the container only has blue water without granules that means you need a refill of the fertilizer. I would stay away from this. It was a waste of money for me.
negative,"Big Disappointment: This book was a major disappointment for me. Bette was a very annoying character. She reminded me to much of Chloe's mother in the first book. Also this book did not seem a little bit cheesy to me. The fact that they decided to make Bette a spy just adds to how cheesy that this book is. The beginning and end of the book were wonderful, but the middle was very disappointing."
positive,"Somebody's got a case of the Mondays.: This movie is simply one of the great comedy's in the history of film. The humor is just so spot on. From the gawky white ultra geek who thinks he's down to the so perky you want to strangle her receptionist, he really captures what its like in white collar America these days. And to top it off the films filled with classic, quotable lines (""Why should I have to change my name? Michael Bolton's the one who sucks""). This flick towers over most of the stuff being put out today that's called comedy."
negative,"Awful beyond belief!: I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"
negative,"The Shelters of Stone: The book was good, however I found that it repeated the history of all prior issues to a point of boredom at times. The book was full of typographical errors on the Kindle version. If it was worth reading again, I would read the paper version in hopes of avoiding a multitude of typos."
positive,"so good it hurts: A brilliant novel. Twain's best, if you ask me. This is abook that has a lot to say, and unlike many books with a lot to say,it says them all without becoming dry or straying from the story. If you don't like this book I feel sorry for you."
negative,"These are not the books you grew up with...: Many of us remember being on a wait list at school or at our community libraries to borrow these horrifying gems. Yes, the stories themselves were spooky. Seeing some of our local folklore in print just added to the eerieness. The most important contributor to the scare-factor was the incredibly grotesque pieces of art that accompanied each story. This reprint features a new, popular artist; however, the illustrations don't have that same terror-inducing quality as before.For me, I think the reason is that there was a lot of mystery in Gammell's work, while Helquist's just doesn't leave anything to the imagination. In Gammell's work the picture is set up so that it is happening TO YOU. In Helquist's work, the perspective is such that you can see it happening to the characters. Just doesn't do it for me. You can google the images or check blogs to see for yourself."
negative,"Buyer Beware: I decided to get a new printer for picture reproduction and small business projects. The printer shredded 40% of the print jobs I sent. The roller jams the paper in back, forcing you to remove a panel and ripping the sheet from the teeth of this monster. It is like playing toy-tug with my dog. If it does not eat your print jobs, then the sheet is fed in cockeyed and it prints off kilter when a lucky sheet makes it out of this beast. I was very dissapointed after only one week of ownership"
positive,"Exlent!!: Fantastic fantisy!! The Hobbit was abusloty exclent!Terrifc charters,an exsiting plot.I would give thies book a 10 thumb up if I coueld"
negative,"Throughly Disapointing: While the first chapter clearly showed possibility, the rest of the book seems rushed - as if, having got his great idea, he didn't know where to go with it and shuffled together bits of every great fantasy book ever written. The title, even, is vertually indistinguishable from Aragorn of Lord of the Rings fame.Perhaps, if he'd spent more time thinking and ploting out the book, it would've been beter. Until that rewrite, however, avid readers of the genre should stick away for fear of disapointment."
positive,"Intro to Geography: People, Places, and Environment (4th Edition): I used this product for my World Geography course in college. A decent text book and a lot cheaper than what the college store was asking for. A few typos and a few wrong facts but other than that a pretty good text book."
negative,"This is actually funny!: My 7 month old puppy loves the taste of this spray! Needless to say, he eats whatever I spray it on. Sorry...wouldn't order this again! Not knocking the product at all..just had to say I thought it was funny that my dog LIKES it! hahahah!"
negative,"Fraud,not as advertised: This DVD was entiled ""Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985"" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. I consider it to be a total fraud and misrepresentation."
negative,"I read to pages of this novel and I had to stop!: I have yet to actually complete this novel. It is so dog-gone hard to understand. On top of this, I have an essay that is due: TOMORROW! Is there no relief?!"
positive,"Works with XP 64!!!!: I tried so many different cards and combos trying to get my newly built Shuttle cube PC to work with XP 64 on my wireless network. I tried two different USB devices and three different PCI devices and none of them worked until this product. What a great price too. I put it in loaded the software and BAM! it work perfectly. Very cool how some thing just work and for about one third the price of all those other devices that I tried. My only complaint would be the 18"" external antenna. I wish it was one of the folding ones that comes attached. Oh well.... I'm just happy to be finished and not have to return any more stuff because it doesn't work."
negative,"didnt seem to do any good: had twins. bought this when having trouble with one not nursing as well as my milk slowed down. did not really seem to make a difference in the amount of milk. tasted gross, I would take it in a shot of water. contains alcohol from the natural herbs. I think its better to nurse often to get better milk as that made a bigger difference on its own than when I used this in conjunction with more nursing, probablly from the alcohol?"
negative,"not worth it: Very dissapointing! It did dry(while it was working) my very curly,frizzy hair, but left it just as frizzy and curly. I still needed to use a flat iron after it. But then it just stopped working. I plugged it in, turned it on and it made a strange humming sound, and that was it. It was functional for 6 months. I can't say that it worked for 6 months though because even though the unit did turn on and dry my hair, it did nothing in the way of straightening my hair. Don't waste your money on it."
positive,"Great Player/Radio/USB drive, but...: I ordered this great little player as a birthday gift to myself. It's outstanding except for one problem - The firmware is the unit as shipped was buggy! In version 1.04.3, any interrupted transfer to the device causes it to malfunction!I looked up the Creative support forum and dozens of people reported the same problem, namely a complete lockup of the unit and subsequent inability to ""boot"" it...My first unit failed after about fifteen minutes of playing with it, loading files, etc. Needless to say, I was distressed. Turns out YOU MUST UPDATE THE FIRMWARE as soon as you get it recharged. Another point I must strongly emphasize is that YOU MUST ""EJECT"" THE DEVICE under Windows BEFORE DISCONNECTING IT.I'm happy to report that firmware version 1.05.1 is much better and that I have not ""crashed"" since updating to it. I'm really enjoying it!I love this product and would give it 5 stars were it not for the buggy firmware that shipped with it. Cheers!"
negative,"Yuck Yuck Yuck: My family enjoys reading the original Eloise. We even sought out the Plaza Hotel during a trip to NYC to see the portrait of Eloise. But....this sequel is just Yuck Yuck Yuck. It makes no sense. As an adult, I couldn't understand the storyline. I asked my daughter if she knew what was going on in the book, and she told me she didn't have a clue. I do not recommend this book."
positive,Pedal To The Metal: I bought this album upon it's release in 1977. This is undoubtly his best effort. I saw Pat Travers in 1977 at Will Rogers auditorium in Fort Worth Texas. This is a small venue that holds about 4000 people and he blew the roof off this place. So glad to see it finally released on CD. This album is unlike Radio Active or Heat In The Street and has not aged one bit. It is more funked up with a touch of jazz to it. There is not one bad track on it. If you don't have this cd GET IT! You will not be sorry.
negative,"It's not the greatest song: I love the neptunes and almost everything done by them has struck me as gold, but this song is not that great. Pharrell can sing ok, but the beats is their forte. And this beat is nothing special at all. Just didn't do it for me. Also, they added the radio edit of Hott (cot) damn. The clean version of that track is stupid. Better off just listen to the real version on Lord Willin'. Not the best cd single compilation."
positive,"Great Book!: I really enjoyed ""Life is a Circus"" by Shirley Carroll O'Connor. It is a warm humorous love story and a first hand insight into what it was like being part of circus life in a bygone era. Shirley writes about of being a newly wed on a Circus train, learning the ropes and class system of Circus life, living on the road and about the friends the bride made among the performers and side show acts. What better training for a woman who later became one of Hollywood's top Press Agents than sharing your life (and car) with wild and dangerous animals. O'Connor's perspectives and insights into the Circus culture can be appreciated by circus fans or anyone who likes a good autobiographical story. Her idea of a bad day was when she (literally) lost a heard of elephants in downtown Hollywood. I found myself smiling and laughing my way through this book. Buy, borrow, or check this book out of the library, it is a great read."
negative,"Disappointed!: Americans reviewed EXTREMELY worthy--Just that there was no depth--more like a sound byte. And most of the stories came from American soldiers from the Midwest who were fighting in Europe. Hey,there were southerners, and there also was a PACIFIC War. Tom whom I adore and admire can do better than this!!"
positive,"This is a nice portable heater,for the office,or den..Is quiet,and good for spot heating.: This portable heater is good for use in your office, den or sleeping area..It is quiet and efficient,and is good for spot heating...please keep away from drapes or rugs,and small children,who might mistake this heater for a toy...Otherwise this is a good deal...Mine came with a remote to adjust setttings more easily...4 star rated..."
positive,another confusing product description: So the two-disc set is supposed to have additonal scenes but the running time is still 157 minutes. Either Amazon has once again provided confusing information or all the additional scenes consume less than 1 minute.
positive,Every man needs it: I believe every mens group should study this book. I know everyone who reads this book will see a bit of himself somewhere while reading it. I will be taking this with me to my next mens group and i will make sure our group studies it.I enjoyed reading about David's Mighty Men. How great would it be if we all had our own group of Mighty Men to encourage us through the battles of life. How much better would it be if we were asked to be a Mighty Man for someone else. A great book.
negative,cheep some what effective: patches down release bubbles most just at the ends and it super fragile one broke in half from setting it down on the table to fast . but for 3 $ u get what you pay for perfect for cheep no frills fish tank
negative,"BOOOOORING: If you are looking for anything with any kind of story or plot at all, this is not the book for you. Simply an endless string of loosely related paragraphs. If you want a book that you cant put down, look elsewhere. This may be more appropriate in a literature class, but definitely not for a good-time-read."
positive,"Moore gets it right!: I've been a bodyguard for over 20 years. I've stood at Oswald's window in the Texas School Book Depository. I've talked to Secret Service agents, who've protected presidents. I've never seen one compelling shred of evidence from any of the conspiracy nuts that Oswald DIDN'T do it! I applaud Moore for this thoroughly-researched book. It stands with Posner's as being among the few that got it right."
positive,"Good Movie: Great price for a great movie from the past. I love underwater shows, and this one is a great addition to my collection."
negative,"Misleading description: Despite the Amazon website describing this BD as region free, it is in fact region 1, and will only play in North America. Purchasers outside North America beware. Don't get caught out as I did."
positive,"masterpiece: This is simply a masterpiece. Nomi is a protege of Sakamoto and here his orchestration shines. Track 1. bears all the stunning hallmarks of a masterwork. If you dont listen to the whole score (and please ignore the whole Country Roads rendition which is awful), at least open your heart to this gem. In relation to the story,the orchestration is a marvel and delight and traces the progress of a young girl waking to the morning sun--enthused and amazed--and proceeds to stroll down to street level--further enlivened by the morning sun to which she looks up to--and promptly, melodically gasps. Beautiful!"
negative,"WHAT A SHAME!: They are sold out but made a loooooong album..... Has anybody listened to the full CD without pulling the ""stop""buttom of your CD player???"
positive,"Extended version tells so much more of the story...: Obviously one of the greatest films of all time, but have you seen the Extended Version? It's got a few scenes that weren't in the theatrical version and they add so much to the story. Definitely worth watching. Definitely worth watching on Blu-Ray."
negative,"Unwatchably boring: ~40 minutes in, so bored I quit. Seriously, unintertained to the extent that I closed the browser. Honestly, though I've stopped watching a movie from lack of interest before, it's never been this bad. Also, the first forty minutes did not start up any comprehensible plot."
negative,"disapointment: I purchased these binoculars from Amazon based on the Nikon name and customer reviews. I suppose my expectations were too high. The optics were respectable, with well lit imagery. The disappointing part was the made in China construction, they felt cheep. They were bulky and heavy and the focus adjuster felt crappy. I returned them, and purchased the Bushnell Legends, they are constructed in China as well, but they are very nice for the money. The glasses feel great and work exceptionally well, plus they come with a great case and extra goodies. The truly amazing part is you can get such incredible binoculars these days for such a little amount of money, doesn't seem realistic. No candy coating, just callin it as I see it."
positive,"Good tool to lose on job: This is not Starret or Mitutoyo...it's made in China. No fancy polish...just a simple accurate tool easy to use. Vendor is darned good on price and shipping. If you lose it on job you won't be crying...just buy another one. Handy size for legnth/width and depth measurements. The jaw allows internal/external measurments of round objects like pipe and tubing. The projecting rod allows depth and height measurements like setting a circular saw blade. For the price, repetitive accuracy is excellent per zero set for the reloader checking case legnth. Most precision measurements don't require beyond six inches so this tool is pocketable (IF you don't drop it.) Tools like this do not come with a 'standard' as they are not field calibrational... what you do is keep a piece of steel around that you recorded measurement AFTER ZERO to track. Toss your micrometers and dial calipers away unless your building spaceships for NASA requiring traceable NIS history."
negative,"not that great: this isn't as good as sasha has been in the past. it's growing on me a little, but i really think that airdrawndagger tends to be a bit on the boring side. i'd borrow it from a buddy before buying it."
positive,Double-sided value.: A great value option of an American Cult Hot Rod Icon. Personally I would prefer 2 seperate discs but this is value for money for sure!
negative,This is not a movie for people who enjoy watching movies!: This movie is outrageous and ridiculous and stupid and corny and just not one to watch and enjoy and absorb often. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this mish mash of scenes. It don't make much sense. Very little character development and even less fun...
positive,"Glorious story: I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story."
positive,Chicano Classic: I loved this film. Innovative and provocative performances! Daniel Valdez and Olmos are awesome. I wish they made more Chicano movies of this caliber.
positive,"Little Kids CAN Do This - also a note about how this is related to a Montessori activity: My 4 1/2 year old daughter received a Crayola Cutter for Christmas and she LOVES it. Yes, you have to move the pen slowly and hold it straight up and down, but I explained that to her before she got started and neither issue seems to deter her from cutting and enjoying it.However, her patience may be the result of her experience with an activity at her Montessori school. They do 'push pinning', where the children manually perforate construction paper to cut out shapes. Compared to that tedious activity, this is a breeze. So if your child has attended a Montessori program and done push pinning, he/she will probably love this."
positive,Constantine: great movie my husband loved it he has been looking this movie so when he opened it he immediately stopped what he was doing and watched it .l way to go
negative,Mr. Coffee Mug warmer: I was very disappointed with this. It barely keeps my mug of coffee warm - barely luke warm for that matter. I don't recommend this product.
positive,"A long March: Middlemarch is not an ""easy"" read as it requires attention to the footnotes, and is 800 pages. It is an excellent study of women's places in British society in the 19th century. It made me grateful to live in modern times, and not be subject to the control of a autocratic husband. The long sections on politics did not interest me much, but I found it necessary to follow them in order to fully understand the story. Even so, it is a great novel, and I'm glad I finally got around to reading it."
negative,"Well Done Aerial Combat Sequences, Little Else: This is one of those films where more emphasis was placed on the aerial dogfight sequences -- little or no thought went into the plot or acting.What a lame excuse for a movie. My biggest complaint of this movie is that it's so cliche you could cut it with a knife. The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim's face before they died.Lame plot, poor acting, dubious historical accuracy, wrapped around some nice dogfight sequences. What a shame, as I had hoped for better than this.Don't buy this turkey. Save your money and get ""Dogfight"" -- more accurate, exciting, and historically true."
positive,"Good chick lit!: This was a very good, fun light read. Very much enjoyed it. Am looking forward to reading more of her books!"
negative,"monotony: Attempting to read this book is worse than watching the grass grow. At least the grass will become something you enjoy. The title and plotline of the story intrigued me to read it. Don't get me wrong, if well-written, this storyline could be very interesting. But even after just ten pages, the only thought going through my mind was ""When will this guy shut up and tell the story???"" The plot comes in a distant second to the narrator's monotone, seemingly unending monologue. If I could withstand this, I believe I would have enjoyed it. But forgive me for not having that kind of patience for hundreds of pages."
negative,Not Durable: Had the bed two weeks and so far not a problem. I did not inflate it to the maximum pressure-I'm 250lbs the maximum load being 300lbs-but rather 3/4 full of air. I have added air only one time-maybe 10 seconds. I sleep on this airbed every night. There is a tendancy for me to roll to the side of the bed-whether that's just me or the bed is yet to be seen. To add to this review I had the bed for three months-the pump went out after that time. I suppose we take our chances.MalcolmL
negative,Wow An Average Rating Of Two Stars.......That Tells You Something!: I have to agree with the masses. This movie is a total bore. The repetitive spoofs back to back to back are oh so annoying. My attention drifted away from this garbage and I startd surfing the net.Not only were the jokes bad but they were gross and unpleasant and demeaning. Even Allsion Harrigan as a thin person was not too pleasing to view on the screen. And the scene where the couple roll a drunk like its the thing to do is so mean spirited.Avoid at all costs. The people have properly spoken.
negative,"Please stop.: I'm on page 91, and I don't think I'll finish this rambling babble. The writing is some sort of self inflicted psycho-therapy, and we are in the chair, next to the couch, tapping a foot, looking at the clock."
positive,Great: This book is in the vein of 1984 and other great books that show amazing foresight. Words of warning for the present and future.
negative,"Really mis-represeted titile: I bought this HOPEING --I would be able to see or learn about My Earp. INSTEAD they mostly talked about other people and just a small mention of My Earp. I did get it in a reasonable time. I WOULD NOT buy this again. I even gave it away . Wasn,t worth watching again."
negative,"Sorry, again a clear miss: I recently reviewed Kathy Reichs' first book and thought it was bad, very bad actually. But because Kay Scarpetta's new one wasn't out yet, I read this one. Again we see our heroine Tempest going through a load of cases, connecting them and saving them. Cool. What Mrs. Reich did better this time: the case is more believable than in the first book. But still: the character is pretty flat, the relationship of the protagonists is way off the standard we came to love with Patricia Cornwell, especially Mother & Daugther. BTW: I knew before I opened the book that Tempest would get a kick over the head after leaving a something. And, yessss for three points, she did. I fought through to the end and then threw the book around the room because I hated myself for reading that far. Spare yourself this one."
positive,"Great Book for Kids.: My 2-1/2 year old daughter has become obsessed with airplanes. So, this is the perfect gift for her. It's got BIG colored pictures of various kinds of planes, and talks about each one. Very cool book."
positive,"Pain is Funny: If you're looking for a deep plot, deep characters, and high-class humor, you've come to the wrong place. On the other hand, if you're looking for a typical underdog story with plenty of comedy, pain, and painful comedy, this is the movie for you. The character personalities are funny (even the supporting characters), the ""training"" scenes are definitely funny, and the whole movie has a storyline that you see coming from the beginning but still get that ""feel good"" feeling when it is over. This is definitely a movie I can watch anytime I need a good laugh. I can't say it's my favorite, but I've seen movies half as funny get rave reviews. Don't take my word for it. At the very least, rent it, and see for yourself."
negative,Not a good Design: Mine is still working but every once ina while ... i have to remove the two screws at the back of the vaccum where the hand held fits in and then clean the path at the bottom of the vaccum. What ever it sucks gets collected there little by little since it has to go a long way to reach the container(around the hand held chord). Further when u use it for suction like the spacer bags...forget it... it has no sucktion when u use the hand held.
positive,"NO SUN :(: I got this for my mom for mother's day because she has a gorgeous garden. She opted to put it on the deck so she can hear the water when they hang out under their canopy thing. From what I understand about a lot of solar panels is that they should be able to store up some energy; the only major disappointment I came across is that whenever the panel is even half way in the shade, the fountain stops running. When the sun is shinning bright, it trickles away.So if you're planning on using this outside, be prepared for an on again, off again fountain unless you have sun all the time. Mind you, I didn't expect it to work all night; but I did think if it got cloudy for 5 or 10 minutes, it would work throught it.But overall, my mom loves it and everyone that's seen it, adores it."
positive,"Nice low-cost option. Very pleased.: Very pleased with this product that I bought as a replacement for a worn out Apple power cable. Apple has changed their plug system with the newest machines, but for anyone out there with a Pre-Intel Mac this is a great option at half the price of Apple's own product. Only gripe is that there is no power indicator light on the plug end, which is a feature on Apple's stock power cord."
positive,"This vacuum does a great job but lacks any extras: We have been amazed at the power of the Hoover Elite. It actually has more sucking power than the Dyson we had for 8 years prior to this one. However, we miss all of the ""extras"" we had become accustomed to with our Dyson. The cord is much shorter so it requires plugging in to two to three outlets before the job is finished, the hose for cleaning upholstery is also short so it is harder to reach items high up, the handle of the vacuum is shorter than we were used to so for taller people it is a little uncomfortable and although it has an allergen filter, it seems to kick up a lot of dust while vacuuming. Overall, it does the job well but it's a Camry, not a Cadillac."
negative,"ONE OF JOHN WAYNE'S MANY B WESTERNS: A TOWN ON THE BRINK OF STARVATION IS SAVED WHEN A MYSTERIOUS STRANGER [JOHN WAYNE] COMES ALONG AND DISCOVERS THAT THERE'S GOLD THAT SOME CRIMINALS DON'T WANT THE TOWN TO FIND OUT ABOUT. PREDICTABLE AND NOT ENOUGH ACTION. IF THE FILM HAD A LITTLE MORE ACTION TO IT, THIS ONE COULD'VE BEEN ALRIGHT. RECCOMENDED ONLY FOR DIE-HARD FANS OF JOHN WAYNE."
negative,not adequate quality: This pouch arrived already torn of damaged at the corner. This kind of item takes a lot of opening and closing wear and this one would not last long at all.
negative,Worst movie ever: I have never been so disgusted with a movie in my entire life. The dialogue was worse than Showgirls. No real person would say or do half the things these characters do. If you like this movie you are a moron.
negative,"Software Does Not Work on NT 4; Tech support non-existant: The software provided explicitly does not work with NT 4 even though the box claims the drive supports NT 4. I tried to call their tech support number about 6 times to find out what alternative software I could use. Each time there was hold music for 30 minutes followed by a message saying to email them, and then they disconnected me. I don't think they actually have anyone manning the phones. I finally returned the drive. I'll never buy another Sony drive."
positive,"Great movie!: I really think this movie is great! It's my favorite martial arts / action film (aside from Bruce Lee movies). And unfortunately it's not appropriate for children. If one is into these kinds of movies and don't mind gushing blood they HAVE to watch it. My dad collected martial art movies when I was a child (I'm 35 now) and I used to watch this movie over and over with my brothers. When the reference was made to Shogun Assassin in Kill Bill 2 I nearly choked on my popcorn in the movie theater. I heard only one other gasp from another patron from across the theatre, so I guess it's safe to say not many people have watched this film, and thought how unfortunate. I was lucky to catch the series playing on the international channel about a year ago. And since watching Kill Bill I've decided to purchase the DVD series."
negative,"Mario vs Streetfighter which is worse?: I love videogames, I love movies, sadly Hollywood has yet to figure out how to put these two together. To put it blankly, this movie is bad, really bad. This movie rivals streetfighter! They both have poor plots, sad sad dialogue, and nothing to do with the games their based on. Koompas aren't reptiles, and Van Dam sure doesn't seem american to me.Heres a better idea, if you like videogames, check out mortal kombat or resident evil. If you like family movies, which I think SMB was suppose to be, check out instead any Pixar movie. Especially with toy story 1 & 2 special editions out now."
negative,"Great idea but mine's broken: Loved this from the moment I put it on the bike. Took a little work, just a little, but switched it to my wife's bike and then back to mine. Some where in there we loaded it down too much and one of the slide in plastic brace ears broke and now it is unusable. Searching for a new way to haul groceries now..."
positive,"My summary of my reading of the Mayor of Casterbridge: The excellent use of language to desciribe the character and nteractions of the main characters was very polished and held my attention completely throughout. I liked the way the story unfolded, not a ""just so"" tale but one full of true to life human strenths and weakneses. The description of the enviorenment and tracking the history of Casterbridge and he normal day to day life of the enhabiants was interesting and made me feel almost that I was there. I would recommend ""The Mayor of Casterbridge"" to any lover of historical novels."
negative,"Extremely Disappointed: This is not the Wayne Cochran I remember. The reviewers that give this CD 4 & 5 stars have never heard the Wayne Cochran I knew. These recordings are ""flat"" - no pizzaz. The were either recorded very late in his career or after he became a minister. SHAME ON AMAZON FOR SELLING THIS ITEM.If this were my firt purchase from Amazon, I would never come backa again. Now I will be much more carefull when ordering. Twenty two dollars down the crapper - thanks a lot Amazon."
positive,They work great for us!: These diapers fit my sons butt and legs great. They also keep blowouts to a minimum as long as you pull out the ruffles/flaps.
positive,"Worst Best Movie: This has to be one of the worst movies ever. In fact it is so bad that I love it. The acting is terrible, along with the story line.A must own."
negative,"Is real science dead?: It's sad what passes for science these days.Publishing companies used to pass over crap like this, but thanks to some stupid sheeple out there, this stuff has an audience.Shirley McClaine is looking rather noble by comparison."
positive,"Almost great: I am not sure which movie all the critics were watching, obviously not the same one I was watching. Granted it could of been better in the development of characters but if they'd included the amount of detail some people would want then the movie would be as long as WW1. The computer generated dog fight scenes are great and keep you on the edge of your seat. It has its funny and sad moments but not too many dull moments. So if you're looking for a couple of hours of entertainment give it a try, if you're looking for a sickly love interest go and watch Titanic for the 50th time.."
positive,Exceeded expectations.: Prompt and in good condition. My 4 year old grand niece loved the book so much she took it to bed with her.
negative,"Amp turns on after music....: I purchased this amp based on the great customer reviews. It is the most frustrating piece of musical equipment I have ever worked with. I do alot of recording and it's impossible due to the fact that the amp does not turn on until there is a signal sent to it, therefore you never hear the first few beats of a song when you press play. It sucks. What a waste of $100. I guess I should have splurged on a higher quality amp."
positive,"very good transmitter: I got this after my Monster transmitter started having some issues - probably due to cord damage. After some research, I bought this one since it also charges the iPod. It doesn't limit which stations you can choose, like some and I have no problem finding a good frequency. Only get static occasionally, which I've heard is a big problem in cities. I've only had it about a month, so I can't attest to its durability, but so far I am very happy with it - haven't had to charge my iPod inside for weeks!"
positive,"These work GREAT!: I've always had a warmer on my desk and in my family room. But finally one died. I didn't really like them because you had to use a tapered cup, as a full size mug wouldn't fit on it. I bought a pair of these on chance and I'm glad I did. They keep your coffee, tea, or other hot beverage hot. It won't heat them up, but will keep them hot/ warm enough to drink. And, not too hot that it makes your coffee bitter. And, you can use a regular mug, it'll fit. I highly recommend this."
positive,"Water Boy: This item is fantastic! No water on the floor, no puppy in the water. It is easily lifted, holds a good amount of water. When finished with puppyhood this item will be great for travel or on the boat. No Spills."
positive,"A Wonderful Shared Experience About Living In A Different Culture: Bruce Feiler shares his experience as a new teacher in Japan and how he accommodates himself to the culture of Japan and its school system. The book includes many humorous episodes as well as studies in how to adapt to new surroundings and to people who have different behaviors from those of our own. The reader will develop a greater appreciation for the way in which the Japanese education system works at the levels described in the book and in how one must develop a thick skin and a great sense of humor in order to be accepted when traveling or working overseas. The characters in this book are real and are brought to life on paper quite effectively. This is a story of shock, adaptation, and, ultimately, but with a lot of hard work - success."
positive,"The sinking of the Carl D. Bradley (SHIPWRECK ON LAKE MICHIGAN: I notice the other reviews of this double book ( two books under one title) concern the FIRE AT PESHTIGO. Just is important is the SHIPWRECK ON LAKE MICHIGAN portion. Essentialy this is one of the better accounts of the sinking of the Carl D. Bradley limestone carrier in Northern Lake Michigan November 18, 1958.Author Davenport picks up the story and moves towards the climax from different angles. One aboard a nearby salty freighter, another on board the soon to be doomed ship and still another in the home port of Rogers City Michigan.As a reader of Great Lakes History this accoount is one of the very best. It may be hard to find a copy as it had been over 25 years since it was in print."
negative,"pass on this: bought in advance for grandson's first christmas. did a fair amount of research to find what I thought would be a great spinning top - a motion he really enjoys. A complete waste - toy does not move, so no sense of spinning and interior moves at high speed that a baby could not even recognize what is moving. Unfortunately, just passed date to return. Don't waste your money."
positive,"Yeow-za!: Whoa! This CD is great! Karen's voice is in top form and the songs (like 2nd Chance, So Good, Brand New Day, I've Been Changed) arewonderful! IF you are trying to decide, let me tell you GET IT! getitgetitgetit! If only for ""A Secret Place""! mm-HM! Oh that song is so powerful! It really really is! I really recomend this to you!"
negative,"Should've been called Above and Beyond Annoying...: Kyla's behavior through out this whole book came across as irrational. When she wasnt talking to herself about how much she still loved her dead hubby, she was actting selfish and just plain self absorbed. When she finds out about Trav's lies, she then turns into giantic, rightous bitch.This book would've been half way decent if the heroine could've been more lovable or more reasonable.. her love for her dead hubby came across as unbeliveable.. if she did love him al ALL at any point in her life.Get ready to spend your afternoon annoyed to all hell, if you do decide to try this book. Not one of her better books, at all..."
positive,Easy Clean and Cost Saving: This system is very easy to use and is mess-free if you follow the simple instructions. I got at least four refills from one kit (less than $5 per refill including shipping). Can't tell difference in ink from HP original. This system really works.
negative,"Very Close to Pornography..: I was never more disappointed in any book I read. The story went directly from the eve of invasion by the aliens to ""Oh, my, they're here!"" with no explination no how they got here. The book was also more concerned with the characters sex life. They spendt 90% of their time having sex, with the aliens forcing their captives to have sex, because they didn't reproduce sexually and were doing 'research'. Even earth people who weren't in captivity seemed to spend most of their time having sex. I will never read any by Mr. Turtledove again."
negative,"so boring.....: the story itself is original(using a common character instead of some nobility), but the story just keeps drugging on forever or something. It is a novel, not a prose!! I wonder why the author had to waste bunch of pages expressing the emotions of the heroin? And I think Tess is terribly idiodic. Why should she continue to love her unforgiving and cruel husband? Isn't that such a degradation of female saying that they will always be loyal to the man no matter how the men desert them? So,do not even try to read this book if you have no time."
negative,"Waste of my time.: I loved the movie, The book is a waste of time. Not well written, She writes like someone with ADD. She's all over the place.Far to much griping, complaining, Julie is not likable. Not a fun read. Had to force myself to finish it.She says its a memoir but also says in the preface she sometimes just made things up. How can it be a memoir then?Won't waste my time on this author again.Rose"
positive,"Having a Webster's Dictionary Easily Accessible: I had been using the online Webster's but I found the listings incomplete and it was a bit of a nuisance to have to go online to get a listing. It is nice having the dictionary resident in my various computers. On the down side, I guess I expected to see more visuals, more graphics, more bells and whistles with every entry but perhaps it is the words I am requesting that are not conducive to such listings. I doubt if I would have purchased it without getting it back from my university professional fund since it is a bit pricey at roughly $50."
positive,"Amazing: My Gf loves it and she said for anal play that its the best thing ever to use in place of her OWN ""lube"""
positive,"Some Things ARE New Under The Sun: This is a truly great film. Script, casting, humor...As others have pointed out, Tremors resurrects the 50's monster movie genre, but it actually offers some new twists. I've been watching B-movies for at least 32 of my 40 years ...I've seen monsters burned, electrocuted, nuked, dissolved, chopped, diced, pureed, crushed...you name it, I've seen it. The writers of Tremors actually came up with new ways to kill the monster! I thought I'd seen it all. In addition, anytime humor is mixed successfully with horror, the result is that the viewer is kept off balance and on the edge of their seat. In my opinion, this is one of the best monster movies of the past twenty years."
positive,"The best 'Romeo and Juliet' ever made.: Heartbreaking story made even more heartbreaking by the two teenager leads. Beautiful scenarios, costume designs, cinematography, and of, course, MUSIC. What the hell the Academy was thinking when they DID NOT even nominate Nino Rota's hauntingly beautiful score? I just checked out the nominess in that category that year. And it is a perfect joke. Ladies and gentlemen, this is perhaps one of the most famous themes coming out of movie, certainly comparable to 'lara's theme' from Doctor Zhivago..."
negative,really weak Film: nothing really happening with this Film.the Girls were Looking Good but as far as the Film Goes not much Happening.it's one of those films you watch when you are in Pure T&A type of Mood.it's fairly a Air-Head Film.
positive,Shell dreams: This movie the Shell seekers is a great movie for the younger generation who thinks senior citizens should be treated like an egg. Angela Landsbury proves her family wrong and protects what is hers against her greedy son and daughter.Beware of the seniors! Great family movie!
positive,"Good movie: I like the actress and the movie, it slowly revealed what was happening. If you like quick action movie, this is not your type. Overall, a nice movie, watchable."
positive,"The Catholic aproach against Fundamentalist views: Although unrealistic at times, this book still got accross the Catholic aproach of some major misunderstood topics. The book also presented how and why fundamentalists contradict the Catholic view of these topics. After facing a devastating situation early in the book, Michael overcomes it and defends the Catholic faith against fundamentalists and their interpretation using good apologetic arguments mainly from the Bible. Overall, I thought this book was very interesting although it had many unrealistic parts. This is a good book for people who want to know about the Catholic faith. It shows different aspects of Catholiscism in a well written fictional story."
negative,Grass: I've used Canadian grass in Ohio & it grew so fast I had to mow it twice a week. This s*** didn't grow in NC
positive,"great item: condition of book was great, better than the description, easy to read,recommended for every library, very in depth yet very simple"
positive,EXCELLENT CD: WE LOVE WORKING OUT TO ZOOT SUIT RIOT. OUR INSTRUCTOR REALLY SETS THE MOOD FOR US TO SWEAT TO THE SWING. ALL OTHER SONGS ARE TOPS !!
positive,"Hi hi hi little droogies!: I just viddied it this noochy and I have to admit I was blown away with the image quality of this transfer; I just love this awesome piece of art and watching it in such way made me love it even more, extras are great, I took a glimpse of Malcolm as an old man today commenting on the movie and some lenghty documentary and that's all on the first disc, haven't even touched the second one; if you're browsing this is because you're a malchick looking for some advice and here it is: BUY THIS!"
positive,It's Clay all the way: I have been following Clay from the beginning and when I heard his song Invisible at the concert I could not waite for the CD to come out. Well it is finally here and I love it. He could sing the Gold Fish song and I would still love it. I think he has that Frank Sinatra make your heart melt voice. The writers need to get moving and write him some really great songs. If you like Clay you will LOVE this CD.
negative,"Does not work: The charger does not charge my battery! And it does not plug in directly into the outlet. Rather, it has a separate cable that goes to the adapter itself and the outlet. It's junk! I am absolutely disappointed!"
negative,"such a letdown: i had a single from this album and a song called IN MY LIFE completely rocked my world...MY MISTAKE. do not call this album techno. call it top 40, or electronic but not techno and do not call it punk rock inflenced or even rock oriented. there is little rock on this album. this album is the predeccesor to play. if thats your bag then by all means this is for you but it is a bland mix of top 40 wanna be music.i also bought animal rights by moby. THAT is quite electic with a good mix of musical styles...yes i did like the soothing intro of hymn, the funky beat of lets go free (song is 37 seconds long) and the blues of what love but this is not a reason to keep this overrated mess. although i do love the thought provoking essays in moby's cd's but otherwise this is not worth your time."
positive,"What I expected: Friend told me about the book , have not started to read it yet. Hope it is as good as she said."
positive,"Aliens Study the Sensual Arts: I was in the mood for some alien invasion movies the other day and watched a small marathon. As well as such movies as The Arrival, I watched a film called Femalien. Femalien reminds me of a modern remake of The Girl From Starship Venus.Femalien is the story of an alien landing on Earth to study human interactions. The energy being is given the form of a young woman. What follows are scenes of her spying on couples and her interactions with others. The alien is collecting and cataloging experiences for her race who have risen above physicality but still miss it. During her adventures she tries to help a local woman retain ownership of her diner.While the plot is weak I do recommend this film for those times when a movie like Invasion of the Star Creatures or Galaxina is the sort of thing you are looking for."
positive,"Superb: I am really happy with the result of this product. Just follow the instruction, take it regularly. You'll be able to get the result within one week. Now I feel better refreshed, better smashed. Thanks to the company for making it available in the amazon."
positive,Works Great: I am thoroughly enjoying the longer battery life. I had to charge my old battery everyday. I only have to charge the new battery every 2 - 3 days.
positive,"Great book for young adults too: I bought this book because of all the other great reviews and I was not disappointed. I actually ordered the next 2 books in the trilogy before even finishing The Named because I liked it so much. Great characters, romance and very original storyline. She could have taken the story so much further too!"
negative,"The Witch of Blackbird Pond: I am very disapointed that my teacher chose this book for my class to read. I feel it was very dull and boring, with nothing to keep the reader attentive. Throughout the entire book, there were no exciting scenes (there was one situation where the author could have made an exciting moment, but instead decided to turn it into a section of tasteless humor) and many of the chapters were about relationships between characters which were not explained enough to be interesting, or the various chores and jobs that the main character, Kit, did.I know there are many readers who enjoyed this book, but I personally do not like books who just tell the lives of someone unless there are some exciting events. Too many of the chapters of this book were wasted on petty happenings such as washing clothes or teaching someone to read. If you are looking for a book with excitement or adventure (which is what the title implies), I do not recommend this."
negative,"Redundant...and redundant: Listened to this on audiobook, and I feel like the whole thing could have been done in an hour. He repeats the same phrases over and over, and makes unnecessary belabored examples, as if trying to make the book as cliche as possible...Body, mind, spirit, balance, chi, energy, core...it sounds as if its designed to be an infomercial.Maybe this book is intended for new runners, but as a runner for over 30 years, it annoyed me to no end. Others have commented on this hypermarketing too. His advertisements for chi walking and chi living underscore his goal to make a brand. He uses the phrase ""Chi running"" at least 30 times in the first audiobook section, a phrase which essentially didnt exist until he created it, with no explaination of what it actually is until later. Long term runners beware."
positive,nice book: bought the book for my lil sister but couldnt help looking inside its got some pretty cool stuff
positive,"Kicks bass!: As other people have said, the bass is a little overwhelming and there's really no way to turn it down ... but I like the loud bass. The only problem is that I live in a dorm and it bothers my neighbors, so that is problematic."
negative,"Kindle eBook more expensive than print copy: I couldn't put this book down. It's a real page turner and kept me up til 3 am trying to finish it before I had to go to sleep. Full love/drama which is what I love about this one.While I found this book to be an excellent read, I am disappointed in the pricing. The Kindle eBook edition is $12.99 while the print version is only $10.88. eBooks cost essentially nothing to distribute, so why the eBook version costs more baffles me. This price difference made me so angry I refused to purchase this eBook or the print version and give the publishers money for ripping me off. I borrowed the print version of this book from a friend instead."
positive,"A REVEIW: THE LAST UNICORN: THE LAST UNICORN IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES,ITS GOT [PRETTY] GOOD CASTING,AND I LIKED [MOST OF] THE SONGS BUT IN THE SONG ""NOW THAT IM A WOMAN"" MIA FARROW [THE VOICE OF THE UNICORN]HIT A COUPLE BAD NOTES, BUT OTHER THEN THAT IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE SO I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERY ONE CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE."
negative,"Horrible injustice to Asimov: This movie is terrible.Its just another formulaic piece of hollywood crap. Its a good thing Asimov is dead because he would have died after seeing this horrible movie supposedly based on his novel. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, and I only gave it one star because you cant give zero stars. The writers,directors,producers,and actors in this movie should be ashamed!!!"
negative,poorly made: I just purchased this product and when I tried to place my 4 leg iron on it it slipped right through. I have a fairly standard board from macy's so I dont think it was because of that. It was very flimsy to begin with anyway. The pieces fit together loosely and it had dirt on it when i took it out of the plastic wrapper which should have been the first clue. If you have anything other than a T bar iron board this product is not for you
positive,"Extremely easy to use and a great value: I have been using this product for 3 years now. It works about 80% of the time, but those times it doesn't is the cartridges fault, usually clogging up or some other kind of problem that has prevented me from reusing it. Even then, the value in this is much, much cheaper than buying new or even refurbished ink cartridges.The ink is great quality stuff. It doesn't look watered down like with most replacement inks.Also, my package states that it refills the following:HP 22HP 28HP 57I have been using this with my HP 22's."
negative,Disappointed: I was really excited to receive this product after reading the reviews. A day later I'm quite disappointed. The bunny ears are razor sharp! Oucccchhhhhh!!!Definitely save your money and go for something else
negative,broken: I was not even able to use this item because it tore upon putting it together. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!
positive,"A Freudian fable: The basic idea behind this book is Freud's theory of the id, ego and superego. Ideal for armchair philosophers."
positive,"Is the Pope Catholic?: The Third Secret is a timely piece of fiction by Steve Berry. The book is about alleged appearances by the Virgin Mary throughout the last 100 years. Father Colin Michener, the Papal Secretary, is brought into a potential conspiracy by his mentor, Pope Clement. We find that there has been a conspiracy by past Popes to cover up a part of ""The Third"" Secret"", which is part of a Marian appearance. This secret part would allegedly contradict present church doctrine.This is a nice work of fiction, based on a good bit of truth. If you like Dan Brown, you will enjoy this book."
positive,"Great Book!: This is another winner from Alan Weiss! It provides specific strategies to build your business.Although consultant is in the title, I don't think there is a business that would not benefit dramatically by reading this book. In addition, the title""Getting Started in Consulting"" is misleading. This book is valuable for EVERYONE, even those that have been in business for years!I agree with the reviewer above in all areas except the rating. I would give it a 10+."
positive,"preferable version: This film is available on dvd from various publishers. Of the three I have seen, this version is preferable, as it contains two scenes that are absent in the other versions."
positive,"The entire album was well written and produced by Lauryn.: I throughly enjoyed each track on the album. Each song gave the listener a look into Lauryn's soul into her life. The two songs that I loved the most were ""Zion"" and ""Nothing Even Matters"". Her duet with D'Angelo was wonderful. The vocal arrangement was beautiful along with that wonderful harmony they had with one another.The album is and will always be one of my favorites. I knew Lauryn would do great things but who knew just how great those things would be."
negative,"Skip over Julie, grab Julia: This book dragged on. Julie is incredibly whiny, and it seemed every other page she was ready to give up her project. Please, do! If you want a truly delicious memoir, read Julia Child's ""My Life in France,"" David Lebovitz's ""Sweet Life in Paris,"" or Ruth Reichl's ""Tender at the Bone."""
negative,"Disappointed: I was very disappointed with the book because it touched on a lot of issues that we as black women deal with, but it never really addressed them. The title is very misleading and to me doesn't even really match with the storyline. I got the impression that maybe as she was finishing the book she got tired and kind didn't really put forth an effort to give the book a meaningful ending. I was very disappointed with the ending and thought it could have been much better. The rest of the storyline jumped around and the plot just didn't make a lot of sense at times - what one thing had to do with another wasn't clear. Like I said, the book touched on a lot of good issues, but provided no good resolution for the characters."
negative,"Unoriginal and crap: Vinnie Moore, Paul Gilbert and Malmsteen were playing like this years before this guy even appeared. I have watched parts of his instruction video and it's years out of date. If you don't belive me get some Vinnie Moore from the 80's and tell me that this guy isn't ripping people like Vinnie off? The only people this will appeal to are the musicians that have no understanding of the genre. Michael Angelo looks about 50 anyway. Teenages were playing this kind of things in the 80's!!! As for the songs on this album, total and utter crap."
positive,"7 of 10: One of the better grownup films lately; good drama, well acted, gorgeous cinema and music. A somewhat plodding pace but the rich cinematography helps a lot. I wish we had more contemporary films of this quality."
negative,"I'm lost: I've never written a review before, but I'm so lost after reading this book that I had to warn others before they come down the same road.I agree with ""a reader"" that the author will ""introduce a topic but, before developing it, tell the reader that she'll explain later how it (method, procedure, &c;) should be accomplished."" It's enough to drive a person crazy. Also, if you run into a problem, too bad. Troubleshooting is a nontopic in this book."
positive,"Psycho Circus - Original members come back as good as ever.: Fellow Kiss fans unite and rejoice. The Original Kiss members are back and with the new release Psycho Circus have put together an album that brings me back to the days of the original makeup band. When listening to this record , it sounds as if they had cut it back in the late 70's. The original Kiss sound is back and as good as ever, Psycho Circus definatley takes it's place among the Great Kiss Albums ever made"
positive,"Really good service: The quality is Good , the service is good. I will recommend it to my friendsI am very satisfied"
negative,"waste of paper: This book was horrible. Predictable, circular, pointless, ridiculous. This is not at all what I expected from John Grisham. Don't waste your time or money. I wish they had a zero star rating. It would go to this book."
negative,"Stay away from IBM Deskstars! PLEASE!!: Do your research before you consider buying ANY IBM Deskstar drive. Unfortunately, when I bought this drive, there weren't many reported problems...yet. There are rumors of a faulty batch of drives, but I think the truth is, it was an engineering flaw. My drive actually lasted 1 year, longer than many others. Then, it started making the dreaded clicking and spinning noises. I was lucky enough to lose only 1 partition and could backup the rest. Now I'm hesitant about even sending this drive back to IBM, just to receive a refurbished one, which could be in worse condition. I think I'm gonna get a new drive (probably Western Digital) and use this one as a backup. There's no advantage to getting an IBM Deskstar, even if it's cheaper.. so just stay away."
positive,"Beginner's guide to Modular Origami: This is a great introduction to modular origami. There are a lot of examples of different ways to put the modules together, creating a different look with the same parts. But just as a warning, if you don't enjoy repetition and get bored easily, modular origami is probably not for you. Getting all the units folded is pretty boring, but putting the end product together is extremely gratifying."
negative,"it thinks it's better than it is: I liked Artanker's other album, so I ordered this one with the expectation of it being just as good. As it stands, it seems like it wants to be better than it really is. I was surprised that there was a whole bunch of DVD extras and music videos, definitely a bonus, but the content was just underwhelming. If you like aimless semi-groove mushroom music, this is probably pretty good, but if you're looking for something with a point, you might be disappointed. Maybe I'm just not hip enough..."
positive,"Vizion ""A Ti Mujer"": I think this CD is cool. The cumbias in it are awesome and the other songs are great. I have seen these guys before in live and can they put on a show. You just have to listen to Juan EL Enano, Muchachita, and Palabras de Amor. They are the cumbias that I love.Juanita"
negative,"Roadster Trophy: I have a Dreamcast hooked to my computer monitor via the VGA adapter. This game does not support this adapter, so I can't play it. It's a new game, so you would think they would support this display, but alas, they do not. :(So, 1 star, since they don't offer good graphics support."
positive,Rice 4 all!: Love this rice cooker! If you cook rice often this is a great rice cooker to have. Rice comes out perfect! It also plays a nice little tune when its done. Have not used all the different functions yet but do not have any complaints. I love this rice cooker!
positive,"Solid Movie: I Have looked at the movie reveiws some people have made about this movie. I thought this movie was a solid movie. The movie gave men hope of what women really want, but by no means the answers. I think this movie tought me to listen a little more to women. I think one of the best parts is when Mel is going to try and save the day. Thisgs blow up and his face, and HH is the one that saves him. I think it makes women realize that men like to be saved as well. I think it's a good learning film for both men and women. I though Mel did an excellent job. Go and buy this movie, because I am going to."
negative,"Picks Noise from Everything: I have three CB radios: Honda JC-216H for my motorcycle ($600.- and it's the reason that I start with CB), Midland 75-822 ($85), and this Cobra 18 WX ST II ($64). My ratings to these three CB are: Cobra 1 star, Midland and Honda 5 stars.The 18WX is very bad compare with 75-822 about noise filtering. I installed them two in the same SUV with identical antennas (Cobra HGA-1500), the 18WX picks noise from every thing: engine, fuel pump, folding motor of mirror, air conditioner, horn and even horn of those cars beside you. The 75-822 just pick nothing but a little the folding motor. It's totally terrible when you use it while driving."
positive,"Favorite Tolkien: I came to this book late, just before the release of the Ring movies. It is by far my favorite because of the faster pace and fuller adventure. A little slow in the middle, but less walking and battling than the Ring trilogy."
positive,"Fluffy fun: Well, no one said it was supposed to be serious, and it's not. It's just a silly, riotous evening of laughter, some of it so 'out there' that you can't believe you're actually watching it. Cast is loaded with French 'name' actresses, all 8 of them. Full of sidelong glances, over the top cliches, French stereotypes, nut-ball songs and dances - and a murder. Dum-de-dum-dum. With skits and schticks that'll keep you up giggling as you remember them later in bed when you're trying to sleep, and with a setting (remote snowbound country home) that is sure to remind you of some of Agatha Christie's classics, this one is a winner, all the way."
negative,"Good Tea - Doesn't last: I have bought one of these 2+ years ago and this is my 3rd one. Mine has failed repeatedly search Keurig Problem and look at how often the solenoid valve fails, the pump won't pump, the lines plug, etc. - people using compressed air to blow out the lines, pinching off the recycle line to the tank, using only distilled water, etc - I have done all of that and here is the easiest route if you choose the path of this coffee maker. I bought mine where there is a no questions asked return policy, first failure to pump and the machine is boxed up and exchanged for a new one. Hopefully this method will put enough failed units on the manufacturers doorstep for them to build a better machine. If you buy one, get extended warranty as you can see from searches most people are past a year of ownership.I like the tea from these machines. I use a tassimo for coffee as it makes a better and stronger cup."
positive,"Back To The Bridge: RT's Go My Way is a much anticipated return to his 70s styled blues rock. Robin has brought back his atmospheric guitar tones provided by the swirly Univibe and Crybaby Wah pedals making this EASILY his best work in over 20 years. The songs are well written and his band sounds great with the addition of vocalist Richard Watts on 3 songs. Trower's vocals are much improved over the Someday Blues CD, and his guitar playing...well you know....great as usual. If you are a fan of Robin's music, you gotta have this CD, you won't be disappointed."
negative,"Great Expectations: I had to read this book over the summer. I like the beginning and towards the middle, but actually when I was reaching the end, it became extremely boring and lengthy. Overall, I didn't like this book as much as I heard about it."
negative,"Have any reviewers actually read this?: The synopsis of this book sounded spectacular, a conspiring journalist gets stuck on a utopian island. The book starts off kind of entertaining but with a bit of rambling but you figure as you go on, it will probably subside. It doesn't. The characters keep going on and on about buddhism, sex and mushrooms. The plot barely starts and barely ends. This is a book with no journey and no destination."
positive,Plano Compact Bow Case: For the price its an excellent bow case. Not made for abuse. Don't know how it would do as baggage on an airline flight tho.
negative,i'm sure i'd love it if i didn't have to read it for school: I think the subject says enough. I'm sure I'd love it if I didn't have to read it for school. I only dislike this book because I have to write an in-class essay for it tommorrow. it's too annoying and i hate the point of view because it's something to be discussed. I'm ure I'd love A Seperate Peace if I didn't have to write an analysis of Finny and Gene's relationship. damn school.
positive,gorgeous ring: I got this as a wedding ring replacement due to the the fact my wedding band is too small for me now. This ring is really beautiful and looks so real. What a great price too.
negative,"huge disappointment: at 180 pages i realized that i was one-quarter through the story and not even slightly interested in continuing. so i visited amazon ans clicked on the one-star reviews to see if their frustration was my frustration. if i finish it, it will be because i force myself. just before this book, i finished ""on writing"" by stephen king who points out [i almost wrote emphatically]: don't use adverbs ever. and if sparingly. Fahrenheit 451 is crammed full of ""he said softly"" and ""she said slowly."" my review: timewaster."
positive,soggy bottom usa: We watched this movie years ago and liked it. It is a funny and good family movie without the bad language scenes etc. Good good clean entertainment.
negative,"Unbelievable!: I am amazed at the high ratings this book received. It was, undoubtedly, the worst book I have ever read. It might have been better with good editing. There were many unimportant characters and many horrible descriptions that could have been omitted. Who really cares about the dogs, many of whom have no relevance to the story. Who really cares about the detailed description of the decor of a room. Yes, I did finish the book that, by the way, had no ending. Toward the middle of the book I actually started editing it. What a mess!"
negative,"artificially sweetened...: An unhappy surprise- from now on I will be reading the ingredients label for kettle korn. A little bit about my palette: I don't do diet sodas, stevia, or any type of low calorie beverages or products (except certain flavors of gum), because most artificial sweeteners leave an aftertaste in my mouth. If you enjoy diet sodas, crystal light drink powders and such, or have to use artificial sweeteners for health reasons- then maybe you will enjoy this popcorn. However, if you are looking for the type of kettle korn flavor and texture you get at the local fair- prepare to be disappointed. This does not have the caramelization crunch factor due to the artificial sweetener- which does not caramelize."
positive,"Go Clay Aiken!!: This album is awesome. It has something for everyone. Pop and a little R&B. Even though Clay did not win American Idol, he lost over Ruben Studdard. Hello! How could he have? He has more music selections and styles than Ruben ever did and besides, I like Ruben and I like his album ""Soulful"" but, Ruben, you can do better on albums and songs if you take the chance that Clay has taken on ""Measures Of A Man."" Go Clay! I LOVE this album!!!"
positive,"THE RED STICK RAMBLERS: very, very authentic. It is so enjoyable to hear a young group such as the ""Red Stick Ramblers"" playing with so much enthusiasm and yet with so much talent. A must for anyone who enjoys original american music!"
negative,"MP3/CD player: the product worked when I first received it, and when I tried a few days later I couldn't get it to operate. Was going on vacation and didn't have time to see if I could return it, but was unhappy I didn't have it for my trip."
positive,"All you need: I have tried tons of different brands and styles out, but these are by far the best I have used. It's nice to not have to look around anymore, I just buy these and I know I'll be happy with them."
positive,"Best album of the nineties!: Oasis is by far the best band in existence today and this album proves it. With all the junk bands around today like Third Eye Blind, NSync, and Metallica it's good to know that there is at least one band around that is truly dedicated to rock and roll. It's too bad that Oasis has had such mediocre success in the U.S. I just can't stand to listen to the radio anymore. I can't name even one good band in the U.S. It seems to me that all the best music is made in Europe. Great bands like the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and now Oasis have all come out of Europe. Well enough with my ramblings. If you want a cd that will stick to your cd player indefinitely buy Definitely Maybe."
positive,"Puts other 'portable' scanners to shame: I've seen several other companies try to produce portable printers or scanners and they have all fallen short of the Canon BJC-55/85. One main reason is this little device that allows you to carry both at once! The software is extremely easy to use. In part because there are no settings to change; you can only ever scan at 300 dpi (most flatbeds have much higher resolution, thus my rating of 4 stars).However, the image is crisp, color is good, and the unit snaps in very easily. I only wish they included a hard case like the one for the ink cartridge which came with the printer instead of a flimsy plastic ""storage"" bag. It is so tiny, this is probably the only scanner you'll ever worry about losing :)"
negative,"2-1/2 stars actually...: Duke Nukem is 1 of my favorite games. Just the FPS series I mean. I played this, and single player was ok, but not too good. It was hard to control for me and to go thru a lot of complicated structures. I mean, u could beat the levels, but it's hard for me to move around.What's really good about this game is the 4 player deathmatch mode. All in 1 N64. It's fun to kill my friends, and the Dukebot too at the same time. Only some levels like Stadium and LA Rumble (highly recommend) are good for multiplayer, since the rest r too large and more for single play.If ur a hardcore Duke fan, get this. But if not, and u like action and FPS games, rent it first. Be sure to try the multiplayer mode! it's fun."
positive,"READ MULTIPLE TIMES! EXCELLENT!: This is the best true-crime book ever written, imho. I actually read this in high school in the 1970s and did a book report on it for one of my history classes (got an ""A""). It seemed like none of the other kids had ever heard of Manson or his ""family"". I read this book so many times the cover was in pieces. If you want to read a scary, gory, and TRUE book that will scare you, don't bother with any of the other books out there. Read this one. It will give you chills to realize how much control one man can have over other people. Of course, since the time of the Tate/LaBianca murders, we have been desensitized because of the Jim Jones, David Koresh, and other cults... But Manson's directives started them all. Very well written."
positive,"The beginings of a masterpiece!!: In anticipation of The Fellowship of the Ring movie due out this December, I've decided to re-read Tolkien's classics, starting with The Hobbit. This is a great and classic story about a quest. It was great to see Bilbo's character evolve from beginning to end, as well as get introduced to all the great characters that populate Tolkien's world. I loved Beorn and wished he was more integral to the whole story, but maybe he's in The Lord of the Rings (I've forgotten!). My only gripe is Gandalf - I thought he was extremely underdeveloped and there was so much more we could have learned about him. As a stand alone story, The Hobbit is a classic, but it just felt like Tolkien was going through the motions and saving his best work for his later novels..."
positive,"The Best of the Series: Most viewers tune into this video to see more of the wide-eyed optimistic Anne Shirley. Anne is all grown up in this series and is facing marital separation, World War, adversity and lost love and friendship. All realities of living during the First World War. This is not sugar-coated, which may be a disappointment to many viewers. I feel that the circumstances of Anne's youth helped her to be the mature, strong adult that you see in this part of the story. I just loved seeing her develop into this kind of woman. This is a mature story with mature storylines. I'm so glad we got to see Anne as an adult."
negative,"Don't waste the cash on the Two Disc Ed.: Batman Begins is freakin awesome...but there are technical flaws with the two-disc edition. The second disc has the copyright infringment notice and the WB logo, and nothing else. There are a few reviews siting this same problem, but I had Amazon to send me another copy only to find the same problem with this one too. There seems to be a conspiracy afoot!!"
negative,"Warmer: Just to start off, warmer is just what this thing does. I like my coffee just a bit hotter. This is my second warmer and it is not any better than the first one. I bought my second warmer at Wal Mart for around $5.00. Target on line list at $9.99. The major reason I use Amozon for most of my purchases is I can find things quickly and don't have to go store to store trying to find something. As I get older it is harder to get out and shop. Most of the time I get good deals but to be careful, you can get ripped off too."
negative,Is something the matter with his voice ?: This cd is just a mess. This is money making corporate rock at it's worst. A real take the money and run phone in job. Sadly Rod has become a real sell-out. Making it worse is his voice. He should have it looked at by a throat specialist and I am not kidding. Will my fellow reviewers PLEASE avoid adding career statistics to their posts and review the cd at hand. Review THIS cd.
negative,Too syrupy: Reminds me of buble gum pop too much. I hate it. It was one ofthe worse cds ever. I am gonna sell it and get my money back.
positive,"I dont care...I LOVED IT: The facts were horribly skewed, Anne's character was evil, Mary was dumb, and there was lots of soap opera drama, but I don't care because I loved it! I loved that Anne was a scheming shrew, George was gay, and that they allegedly had an incestuous child that died in utero, but most of all I love that it was such a fun story to read. It was almost trailer trash, but so unabashed in it's telling that you've got to admit that Gregory has balls. As for the fact that it wasn't true to fact...who cares? It's a story and a great one at that!"
positive,"Amazing Amazon Doctor: We met Dr. Smith when recently in the Amazon in Peru. She cured my husband's plantar fascitis with a shot of lidocaine which we feel enabled him to walk properly and thus stretch the fachitis. It cost 25cents for the lidocaine and needle and he had spent way more of that in the States with a cordisone shot,MRI, special night boot, creams to rub on his foot, etc. In any event we love this woman and have begun a correspondence with her and her foundation. Her book tells how she left a thriving practice in Wisconsin to come to the Amazon and open a clinic. She is a very special lady. Her story moves quickly and is interesting. If you ever were tempted to do good in the world this woman takes you step by step on her journey. Truth is often better than fiction."
positive,"Welcome Home Eleanor: Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson)went to the haunted ""Hill House"" together with three other People, included Eleanor (Lilly Taylor), a bisexual Theo (Catherine Zeta Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson). Everything seemes harmless... at the beginning of course. But it isn't! Strange things happening to the Guests of the ""Hill House""! Children are talking to them, Statues are moving and bloody footprint are leading them to mysterious places! All this is happening most of all to Eleanor. She is seeing things. Things that nobody else cans see...This is a hillerious Ghost-Story with breathtaking Special Effects and a just perfect ""Hill House""!!!Buy this DVD but beware: ""Everyone lives in Town three Miles away from here. Everyone leaves before Dark. Nobody will come any nearer than that, in the night, in the dark..."""
positive,"pleaseing but lacking a lil spice: This was good movie...Ashley Judd always does a good job. And Greg Kinnear what a cutie. This movie is along the lines of i love you, but you love him..don't know what ya got till gone..type of deal. You laugh, you aww, you get teary eyed. It has all the base elements of a romantic comedy. But at the end i felt there still should been more of something. DOn't get me wrong it still was a good movie....but it needed just a lil more spice to it to make it a great movie."
positive,"The Band that Swings Kicks!: The only song I knew before I got the 'Daddie's disc was thier smash ""Zoot Suit Riot"". Now, a scant three weeks later, I know nearly every song by heart. I've worked to this CD, and of course danced to it. I love hearing Riot on the radio, now I can hear it all the time. Furthermore, I'd like to hear the following songs from this disc on the radio: ""When I Change Your Mind"", ""Here Comes the Snake"", ""Come Back to Me"", definitely ""Brown Derby Jump"", and ""Dr. Bones"".

positive,"All the King's Men: A steamroller of a book, All the King's Men begins in action and ends in action. The trip from one end to the other is one of the most riveting, enthralling, and emotional in my experience.It is less of a political novel than philisophical treatise. But inside our journey through mankind is the powerful engine of human enotion and All the King's Men runs the gamut.Warren had great facility with the language, in line with Twain and Faulkner, utilizing an extensive vocabulary that does not cloud or interfere with story or plot.Get the idea of a man who ""debauched massively"" from an automobile seat, and you see what I mean. Warren creates images that guide the viewer into the mind of the storyteller, yet exceed any one man's grasp. We enter the mind of God, and He has quite a story to tell.I cannot recommend All the King's Men more highly."
negative,Little Giant Ladder: Pros: The concept is very good.Cons: Is over priced The ladder is very heavy and hard to adjust to certain positions because of the weight. Weight hampers carrying it around easily. If I had it to do over again I would not buy it.
negative,"Do NOT buy: If I could give it zero stars, I would. Plain and simple, it doesn't work. I plugged the unit into my Visor Deluxe, connected the cable to my Nokia, tried connecting and received the error message ""No dial tone."" It also seems to crash my phone in that half of the time it tries to connect, my phone ends up shutting off.The Xircom website has little by the means of support for this product and nothing specifically addressing this issue of not connecting, let alone crashing the phone.I've spent nearly an hour looking for support manuals and trying to connect without luck. The only review I can find on this product is one here on Amazon. I would also like to make an observation: this product is not listed on the Handspring website, nor at PalmGear. What does this say for the product?All in all, a huge disappointment."
negative,"So far, it's not worth $...: My Tomb Raider game is filled with bugs! Within 10 minutes of downloading it, I had to restart my computer 3 times! When the game does show up, I get a blank screen. I can hear the sounds and all but there are no pictures! Whatever I do I cannot get it to work. I've tried so many websites for help! I've waited a year for this and now I wish I didn't get it. Maybe it's just my game? But other people have been having the same problems too. Well, at least the box is cool. |=("
negative,"one of the worst movies I have ever seen: Please, do not waste your time watching this movie. It is not only a waste of time, but a waste of money too. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I almost left when I watched it at the cinema."
negative,rent don't buy: I attempted to watch this film a few different times. I could just never quite get to the end. It's not because it's a particularly bad movie in fact it's just a modern day version of James Bond... its just that it never really excited me. The one redeeming factor is the car - it really becomes a character of its own.
negative,"I GIVE IT THE DICKENS!: Reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS as a 14 year old high school student in 1967 helped me acquire a clearer understanding of the concept of infinity. Eternity could never be as long as this book, which I endured to its soporific, boring end. I recommend it to hold up the end of a busted sofa!"
negative,"Somewhat Misleading Title: Being a rabid Gloria's fan from the mid 80's on, I rushed to purchase this album. To my surprise I found myself hitting the next track button more often than not.'Por Un Beso', 'Punto De Referencia', 'Dame Otra Oportunidad' are songs best suited for somebody else. At times it appears that Gloria is struggling to make the notes.When I read 'Alma Caribeña' in a title I espect songs like 'No Me Dejes De Querer' or 'Tres Gotas De Agua Bendita' when I want to hear some salsa rythms or 'Como Me Duele Perderte' and 'No Me Dejes De Querer' if I want just to chill and enjoy Gloria's rich and beautiful voice.I'm still a fan of Estefan's music but this 'Alma Caribeña' sadly isn't my favorite."
positive,"Never glorify your pastor...: ""Casting the First Stone,"" was a masterpiece, a clear depiction of a corrupt minister. Curtis Black was placed on a pedastal by his family and congregation, glorified to no end. However, he didn't live by the words he preached, which is very realistic in our own lives. Lesson learned, never glorify the man on the pulpit. Hear the pastors words and look up to God for guidance.~LeBlanc author of ""Characters of Lust"""
negative,"disappointed: I didn't like the book at all. A few pages into chapter one was all I could do.I had to re-read at different times to make sure what I was reading,though the writing style was simple, I found it difficult to followunless I was trying too hard to comprehend the message that I missed it.I don't know. Maybe later....much later, I will try reading it again.Material is vague, and seemed to me at least to be written in riddles.I understand his books are very popular, but I at least could notidentify with this author. He had absolutely nothing to offer menot even spirituality.I think Oprah's show on the same subject was far more beneficial."
negative,"B-movie!: A lot of cable stations play substandard flicks like this when they don't show the good stuff. This movie has the predictable chase scene, the predictible kidnapping, and the predictible boudoir action. If you loved seeing Michael Rooker and his basement in ""Mallrats,"" you'll like seeing him and his basement here. This time, he has cranial hair and it looks great on him. Don't get me wrong: some will like this flick. Still, many will see that it's the same ol', same ol'. It is just basically nothing to write home about. It's not despicable, but it's not praiseworthy either."
negative,"A curmudgeon review: Ok, military soldiers have short hair cuts, but not Sorbo. The first air-boat scene, the air boat was so overloaded, it could barely move. The script was so poor, that I wanted to vomit. A soldier takes a look at a corpse from 2 feet and says that the head has been drilled into and the brains sucked out, making him better than Kay Scarpatta. Really!"
negative,Not Very Good!: This product did not work in my case. It did NOT keep my Hot Tea - Hot or warm for much longer than normal. Not sure why but I wouldn't recommend! [:@]
negative,"Huh?: I get the idea to be clear and to the point. But this was outdated before it was written, a real basic book,kids should read it once"
negative,"Don't pass water, in the water. . . .: Dr. Emoto is a high-ranking member of the Anunnakki Lizard people. He loves the idea of millions of people being distracted by this nonsense when there are real issues in the world to contend with.Freezing water and taking pictures is a way that Emoto will get you to join his crusade to fight against truth, justice, and the mole-men from mars. Sometimes people drown in 2 inches of water, so be careful!"
positive,great value: Very nice collection of Thoreau's work. Perfect for anyone wanting to get better acquainted with Thoreau.
positive,"BEST MOVIE EVER!: This is one of my favorite movies ever since I was a child. I never get sick of it and can watch it over and over again! My favorite is the ending where baby runs up to Johnny and she jumps up into the air and does that arch thing with Johnny holding her up. AWESOME! I highly recomend this movie for all ages, altough there are some sexual references, ther are very little! ;)"
positive,A good read: For a first story written almost a century ago. It is an interesting look back on life pre-knowledge of what Mars is really like.
negative,"Scary: I bought it for 2 1/2 old, and she hates it, she is soooo scared of it, she cannot even see it, maybe she will be ready in 10 years"
positive,"One of the best sports movies out there...: Hoosiers is the tale of disgraced college basketball coach Norman Dale (Hackman), as he leads a small town high school team in Indiana to glory, battling biased fans, drunk assistant coaches and the system along the way.This is a quality sports movie, which cannot be said about many, and with solid work from many smalltime actors is made into a memorable one. The small town story resembles that of Larry Bird's rise to fame as a Boston Celtic, and this is a movie you will want to watch many more times."
negative,OVERPRICED: Gillette got me. I love the shave of the fusion but the cost of the blades is absolutely RIDICULOUS. It's way out of hand to be paying this much for shaving necessities. DONT get hooked like i did. Stay with your razor.
negative,"Poor Edition: This rating reflects the quality of the edition, not the work itself. There were many points in the text where letters where smudged, only half printed, covered by blots of ink, or otherwise rendered indistinguishable."
positive,Funny & heart warming: You don't have to be fat to love this book of about finding yourself and standing up to the challenges and judgements of everyday life. I was in tears with laughter at some of the parallels I found in my own life. Read it - you will love it no matter who you are!
positive,"Amazing book, but.....: Dune is a great book, the problem however is with this edition. There are several obvious spelling errors, and at least twice i've seen whole lines repeated twice in a row. Try a different editon."
negative,"Boring: Okay, I'm not a member of MENSA, but I love games like Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne which require strategy and thought so I'm not a complete mental turnip, either. The problem with Khet is that it's a lot like chess, which has certain traditional opening moves, but with Khet nobody tells you what those are, and unless you're the type of person who really enjoys spending a lot of time just figuring out how to play - as opposed to actually playing - this game will bore the hell out of you."
negative,"What do women want?: My guess, is that women want a stronger movie than this. It's an interesting premise. But what we have is a strictly average movie. The movie is formulaic. The movie is beneath Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, and I'm surprised that either of them took the parts. In the end he turns around to be the better man, she gets her job, love wins out, a neat, pat ending, blah, blah, blah. We've seen this movie many times before. This one just runs a little longer."
negative,"An Aaron Carter RIPOFF: This guy thinks he's so clever because he ""does"" his own music. Well, machines do most of it, he just presses buttons. But ripping off Aaron Carter and Lizzy Maguire's style is downright atrocious. Stay away from this carbon copy borefest. I'm feeling cranky today. Get some original music by real, innovative musicians such as Cannibal Corpse, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Death, Led Zeppelin, and Tori Amos, to name but a few. Have a happy day."
positive,"We Are the Architects of the World: This album is a few years old but but has really stood the test of time: it still has the power to move me greatly. ""I can tame all the tigers in your bloodstream: can you lay all my ghosts in their graves? What you couldn't find in books, when you've broken every spine..."" Beautiful."
positive,Still a good read: Hadn't read the Hobbit since I was a kid and wanted to do so before again before the movie was released. It still was a good read. Not as well developed as the trilogy but overall a nice escape.
positive,"why haven't I seen this before now?: Amazing performances, poignant yet funny, a human story of unlikely relationships, redemption, and transformation. I am a Robin Williams fan and he shines in this movie, just brilliant."
negative,"not for moral readers: I know this is something of a ""classic,"" but readers should be forwarned that in this book, the hero frequents prostitutes and seduces a married woman (actually he tries to seduce three of them). The affair takes up about 50-100 pages with references to it later in the book as well.There are good parts to this book. The very beginning is interesting, and one can find interesting material throughout the book. But at a certain point, the main character starts visiting women of ill repute and starts seducing married women. It was at this point that I started wondering, ""What kind of person was Abe Cahan if he could write about such matters in such detail? And what kind of morals did Cahan have if he makes this affair seem somewhat wonderful, rather than dastardly?""Be forewarned!"
negative,"Get a hornbook to learn Civ Pro!: This was the most confusing subject I've ever endured in my life. Unfortunately, this case book only added to it. There are cases after cases that are supposed to help you understand civil procedure, but there is little discussion of the law itself or about why the court decided the first case the way it did but did the polar opposite in a second, similar case. The questions that are provided after the cases are designed to help you analyze the law, but they are of little help when you have no foundation. Most people will probably need to consult at least one other source to understand civil procedure. If your law library provides a hornbook, make it your best friend. It is too late for me."
positive,"Good Table, well made and sturdy: I just finished putting together my table and am pleased with the way it looks and functions. It's a strong platform for the KDS-50A2000. As the other reviewer mentioned, it's a little cramped for bigger components; I wish it had more room. Assembly wasn't too bad but required patience.My only complaint is about the Amazon merchant, etronics. I would not deal with them again if I didn't have to. The item arrived in good shape, but they are just way too slow and not very responsive to inquiries. The item sat in their warehouse for days, ""ready to ship"" they told me, but just lingered there. Tracking data was very slow in being provided. If you can buy this table elsewhere, you probably should."
positive,Great read: This book is a must read for those who want to improve there management skills. It gives good advice and examples. It is easy to follow and an encouragement to put into practice what they share. Whether you are starting out in management or have been doing it for awhile you will benefit from reading this book. It isn't too long so you can get the points they are making and easily use the information.
positive,Good buy: I've had this for 3 months now and it gets used about once a week and so far has held up well. So easy to use and takes no time at all. I would recommend this product.
negative,"Don't buy from Antonline: We purchased this tripod for one of the larger Sony cameras that we also purchased through Amazon. The camera is awesome. The page for the camera recommended this tripod so we bought it from Antonline. This tripod is not nearly strong enough for use smoothly with our camera and when I contacted Antonline for a refund they refused to deal with me, even if I paid the shipping back to them. If you buy this tripod, beware that truly strong remote control tripods can start at $300 and go up from there."
positive,Not as good as the first: With version 2.0 Grabage tries to relive the newness of the first album by upping the techno and yet they fall into a very pop like atmosphere in a series of their songs. But as always the are at the head of the pack.
positive,"Recently reunited with a long lost friend: 30 years ago, when I was 14, I read this book from cover to cover in a day. Action of this sort was new to me & I was hooked on it. I could not get enough of John Carter & his adventures and read all the books in the series. John Carter was a real hero and what boy becoming a man didn't want to be just like Carter? While browsing the local library shelves last week I found an old edition of A Princess of Mars.It was like rounding a corner and walking into your best friend you've not seen in forever.I read this book again as if it was the first time ...it was more glorious this time than 30 years ago.This book is filled with adventure,courage, action,devotion,insight & is extremely well written. A Princess of Mars is a must read..as great as Tolkien's Rings & Howard's Conan."
negative,"You get what you pay for: This book is horrible. It drags out info that could be said in ten pages and attempts to make it a book. Boring, monotonous, tedious, and beats the reader over the head with Christian morality and scriptures."
negative,"Steer clear of this bummer of a live one: This dud of a live album finds the Stones phoning in fairly uninspiring renditions of songs at breakneck speed. Shattered loses its sleazy groove to the double time pace; Let Me Go feels like the throw-away track it was on Emotional Rescue. Only Under My Thumb, grossly underplayed in concert, and Going To a Go-Go are worth the price. Satisfaction sounds a lot better on Flashpoint as does Start Me Up. The must have live Stones albums still are Love You Live and Get Yer Ya Ya's Out. For die hard collectors only."
negative,"Out of Date: I read this book prior to sitting the exam, then used some other exam simulation software and felt a little bewildered because I thought I must have been missing something, somewhere. Then I read the Sybex book on the same certification and and it all made sense.While I think this may have been a good book a while back, sadly it is out of date and best left on the shelf."
negative,"Good monitor if it is working ... Really bad QA Issues: I bought this monitor back in August 06. This is a very good LCD panel as a computer monitor or (HD)TV. All of a sudden, within 2 months, the monitor turns itself off automatically. The symptoms continued for a week and a few weeks later, it completely dies.I called Samsung Customer Service (1-800-SAMSUNG) and they agreed to send a replacement. RMA arrived in a week, I hooked it up and ... viola .. there is a yellow vertical line in the middle of the screen. I called Customer Service again, and they agreed to send me 2nd RMA.I'm crossing my fingers that I do not have to do RMA again.This is a really good monitor when it is working, customer service is very good too ... but .. very disappointing experience so far.My first monitor is manufactured in July 06 in Mexico.My second monitor is manufactured in September 06 in Mexico.I wonder if there are serious QA issues in Mexico."
positive,"love it!: I love using the boppy, not only for the baby but for me. It is great to sit on post episiotomy and also to use as a back rest when breastfeeding in furniture that sinks in."
positive,awesome: Awesome cd will be back to get more music great service great music to offer to people really good prices on music
negative,"Beautiful Writing, Boring and Confusing Narrative: In this book many characters are parallel, mimicking thefutility of war and the cycle of meaningless brought onby wars. The characterization lacked depth but the writ-ing ha a beautiful quality of magical realism like inother books by Marquez. Again, Marquez's focus on pedo-philia was disconcerting.How can I like a writer so much yet dislike his book?The answer is that beautiful writing is not enough tocreate a good book. Their needs to be excellence inform and content. Marquez is excellent in form but heis very low in content. I found this book more confus-ing than any other book that I completed. If it hadnot been written by Marquez, I would not have finishedit."
positive,"Great boots for the price: I bought these boots because my $40 Wal*Mart boots were not getting the job done. These provide excellent support and are very comfortable. I bought them 1/2 size large and they fit perfectly. Don't get these boots if you are going to be working in the cold a lot; they breathe well and are great for cool to hot weather, but it does not take long for your feet to get cold on a day that never gets out of the 30s."
negative,"Overkill: While I absolutely love the four agreements and return to the original book often, I found the companion book to be completely unnecessary. The writing style was poor and rambled in circles, constantly repeating itself. There was no new information at all. I seemed to me to be a way to get a little more money out of the concept - shocking considering the author.I did enjoy the last few pages of personal examples from people who had incorporated the four agreements into their lives.If you have the four agreements original book, you don't need this one and if you don't then skip this one and get the original."
positive,"Highly recommended!: Purchased these for a friend as I have a pair myself and they are the BEST tweezers in the world, bar none. I think if you have longer fingers you might wanna spring for the regular sized slant tweezers but since my hands are small these are the perfect size/grip. I have used nothing but tweezerman mini slant tweezers for the past five years. I swear by them."
positive,"Makes it easier: This is a relatively inexpensive tool that will make your model making easier and help you avoid the need to be using door frames to draw lines. If you're new to model rockets, or returning after 20 or 30 years as the grown-up, here's the easiest way I can describe why you need this: you're going to be measuring and drawing lines on tubes. They need to be accurate, from end to end. There are plenty of other purposes for this item, but that will probably be the first difficult step you'll face. It's definitely worth having."
positive,"I love this movie, and josh jackson looks real good.: i liked the movie cuz the guy that was sayin all that stuff..forgot his name...the 1 with red hair...he reminds me of a friend, and i really enjoyed all 3 of the movies."
negative,"Great idea - shoddy construction - waste of money: I purchased this as a replacement for an old roll up tatami mat that I purhased at least twenty years ago. These are perfect for taking to the beach but couldn't find them local now. The tatami is woven tightly so that it keeps the sand off. Saw this and looked like a good idea.These are really three separate tatami mats, each about 11"" wide by about 6' in length, joined by a blue canvas strip that runs the full length (top to bottom). It is colorful and handy, folding up in to object about the size of a large book with handles.Problem I ran into was that the strip joining two of the panels ripped apart first time I took it to the beach, rendering it useless for its intended purpose. Perhaps mine was just a bad sample but at $10 a throw, I will be asking for a refund."
positive,"Waiting for the second book to begin: ""Waiting for the World to End"" is a book everyone can relate to in one way or another. The characters are well-thoughtout and very likable. This book has just about everything you would like to read about: love, denial, lonliness, sadness, joy, sports, religion, etc. It's a very fun and exciting novel to read. It'll have you never wanting to put it down."
negative,"LAME!!: By far one of the worst animes ever! Minimal story line, old school animation, and unnecessary skankiness in the first part of the series."
negative,peice of garbage!!: Okay this game was pretty fun when I first bought it but after that it just wasnt fun anymore. the thing has no plot but fight viruses and enter tournaments which are VERY hard. Plus there is quite a bit of shaking for an electronic game.
positive,A WONDERFUL READ: This book is a joy from beginning to end. Funny and insightful. I've recently reread it and found it more enjoyable than the first or second time. Her best work.
positive,"Decent light: The light is decent, is good for providing a little extra light in a local area, definitely not for applications like camping but just fine for someone like a stage technician. I bought it for the UV light to check IDs with.It works just fine and had a solid feel to it. I liked the placement of the switches for the UV and white LEDs. The holster had a snap, but the snap was right over one of the buttons, so you have to be sure that when you put it back that the buttons aren't facing out when you put it back.Mine broke after about a year of use every weekend. The wires that connected the switch to the lights to the battery chamber had loose connections, and it was not designed to be fixed. For ~$25, I didn't particularly care."
positive,"hooray for TIVO!: I gave this to my wife for Christmas and now we are both hooked on TIVO. Basically, just like everyone says it will, it changes the way you watch TV. Bye-bye commercials. See ya stuff we don't want to watch. Now we really do watch only what we want and we get to watch it on our schedule. Having said that, the reason I did not give it five stars is the setup is quite an undertaking. The hooking it up wasn't too bad, but the oodles of menus that follow take a while, and when we got to the part about linking it into our wireless network it went over our heads. We still have yet to get that feature to function. Even after you purchase separately the wireless network adapter, it seems as though the network itself must be set up in a pretty specific way. Luckily you can still do it through the phone line as well or we would be up a creek. Overall I would say that TIVO makes me happy."
negative,"Just wasn't funny: The comedy in this movie was trite and pedictable. You have your crass old guy in a wheelchair, a fiance hopped up on drugs, a midget with a horrible secret about the recently deceased, and a typical pretentious rich guy. Barring one slightly humorous awkward conversation I've been to funerals(sorry) that were funnier.Not much else to say other than I rarely stop movies, but I stopped this one and don't regret it in the least."
negative,"Doesn't work properly: Bought this about a month ago as a back-up adaptor. When used on my Powerbook G4 and my wife's iBook G4, it does not charge them when in operation. It supplies power so that the units are functional when plugged in, but it will only charge the units when they are closed or turned off. I'd give this a one star, but at least it powers them when they're on, even without the charging."
positive,"Good book but took forever to get to me: I ordered this book in March and did not receive it until June, way too long to wait for a book. The book itself is great, when it finally arrived it was in good condition. This book was recommended by one of my college professors for people who were interested in more of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works, and is basically a utopian society novel."
positive,"This book was me to the core!: I can't express the gratitude I feel toward Karon, for expressing exactly how I've felt about going through ""the wait"" for so long. She hits the nail on the head with every single paragraph of this book. How does she do that? I found myself wanting to read it over and over, and truly contemplating the questions at the end of each chapter. Amazingly, the same answers kept coming up for me, so I truly got clear on what I had to do. Thank you, Karon, and thank you Lord for using her to help me! A MUST HAVE!!!"
negative,"Excessive tonal music background: I tried watching this on TV. I could not say which edition but the tonal background music was in a pitch that was giving me a headache. It tended to overlay the dialog, which in some cases seemed to come out like a mumble. I could have done without Hollywood's idea of background music. It is really not necessary to have tonal music running through an entire motion picture. OK if you are not bothered by the pitch of the music. Otherwise forget it. I turned it off part way through and switched to something else."
positive,"Why won't people stop making fake reviews?: This product is excellent. I was able to perform multiple tasks with the one specimen, and it performed admirably. What i do find annoying is the number of amateur comedians filling the reviews area with unfunny references to 'Back To The Future' jokes and various 'evil doctor who lives in a volcano lair' puns... some of us have srios work to do and would appreciate not having to wade through pages of jokes before we can find a reliable review that can help one pontificate whether or not it will further our nefarious schemes. That is all."
positive,"Surprise: I've watched the show for years and thought I knew a lot about it, but this book took me backstage and behind the scenes in such cool detail I quickly realized how much more there was to the story of this show. These guys managed to make all the years of the show entertaining and revealing, and I really liked the fact that I could pick up the book, turn to any page, and find a great story to jump from. Probably the best book on a TV show I've ever read."
positive,one mestcrap head to another: i thought that this cd was pretty good. i definatley would tell others to buy this cd its definatley worth the money.meggers
positive,"Not my usual type of moving but just had to have it!: I am really not a fan of blood, guts, testosterone driven movies, but I do love this movie. Perhaps because there is an actual story line or because there is some inclusion of real (not to say strictly accurate) history of the Roman Empire, it is one of few modern movies that is a 'go to' when broadcast on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Decided I should really own it; the snob in me justifying the 2 hours of eye candy Russell Crowe, with smugness of having read Marcus Aurelius, let alone knowing who he was!"
positive,"The best he ever did: As the man said, this is the best recording he ever did. This, from one of the finest pianists in the entire history of jazz. There's an enourmous quantity of high quality music on the 3 CD set and the recording quality is high class. These recordings were done at the peak of Oscar and this band's powers. A supreme trio - a supreme listening experience."
positive,Great case: Awesome case to go with my new stabila levels. Was just as described in listing. Thanks for a great product and quick shipping.
positive,"An awesome experience!: I was actually an extra in this film. During production the film was called ""Detention"". The director and everyone in the cast did an amazing job putting this movie together in the short time that it took. When I finally saw the finished version on television I was stunned at how mesmerizing this film actually was and I was there for the filming of most of it. There are several really good actors and actresses in this film and this is a most see kind of movie. Enjoy!"
positive,"This is what adversity solutions is all about!: Paul has cut to the chase on how one deals with adversity in a solutions-based model. I have used the Adversity Response Profile with both clients and family and they work. You have heard the saying before but AQ gives you what you need to know...in real time...in ways you improve your overall performance. Don't leave home without it! C.D. Morgan, III Founder/Chairman The Forte Institute."
positive,ssx on tour vs ssx 3: compare ssx 3 it has same feature but serious lacking some fun that ssx 3 for example it harder to turn and little slower in speed compare to ssx 3. it a few step behind ssx 3 but still fun to play and the print is hard to read on ssx on tour
negative,"Takes on water page one, sinks by page fifty.: Set in the world of piracy in the 17th century, Birds of Prey trips up early. Hardly surprising, when in this masculine world you've still got women 'screaming wildly and clutching their bosoms' at the sound of gunfire. Maybe they did, maybe they didn't, but the prose is more painful than any blast of grapeshot. There are far too many examples of school play dialogue to list, but if you're looking for an exciting seafaring tale, you'd do much better to turn to 'The Golden Ocean' by Patrick O'Brian."
positive,"=^.^=: Hi, I'm Squirrelpaw!Thanks for all the positive comments. Good ratings, too! 5*'s!Oops. Gotta go. My hunting assesment.6 pieces of fresh-kill by sunhigh!Bye!"
positive,"Fresher than fresh!: To all you gangsters out there! This is hip-hop in its purest form and this is how it should be. All this gun, money, Versace, and crystal talk in today's rap just plain wack. So, know your hip-hop and buy this dope mix tape! (ya heard') P.S. Watch out for those ""sucka emcees."""
positive,Works very well 5 starts: Very fast connection workS great while watching netflix and youtube videos on tivo. I was told by a friend that its better to use hard wire than wireless but this couldn't be farther from the truth. This works great and I haven't had any problems with the speed. I would recomind this for anyone who has a tivo.
negative,"Piece Of Poo!!!: This is the worst cd i have ever heard. If you like no hooks and, emotionless dribble then this is the record for you. was this recorded through an A.M. radio? I wouldn't give this cd to my worst enemy.THIS SUCKS!!! I want my money back!!!"
negative,"MOST ANNOYING NIGHTMARE FILM!!!!: Let me start by saying yes i'm a kid, because i'm 13, and I am a big fan of the nightmare series, but this final addition is ridiculously long, confusing, and annoying. It's long, because it's 112 minutes, it's confusing, because it barely makes any sense, it's annoying, because you predict every scene, and Heather's son dylan screams for no reason all the time, and you hardly ever see Freddy. There are only 4 kills in this one, the first three all happen in the first half hour of the movie, making the movie slow. The kills are for the most part terrible, the only good one was where Chase was gashed in the chest by Freddy's claw which came out of the car seat. So overall, this ranks #6 in the Nightmare series for me. Those of you who dont like this movie and feel lonely for it, don't, i barely watch this one. So don't buy this movie, unless you just want to complete your freddy collection."
positive,"Outdated but insightful: The author's style is captivating and simple. He was in Japan over twenty years ago, so I'm assuming that some if not much of his anecdotes may be regarded as dated over there. Regardless, a fun read which doesn't follow the stereotypical 'Japanese kids don't have fun' or 'Japanese people don't have individuality'."
positive,"Not for everyone: I was really excited to try this, however it is not for everyone. I have a ""flat"" stomach just flabby and then I have ""love handles"" so I thought this would just hold everything in but that's not how it worked for me. It feels great when I have it on but when I look in the mirror I have this pooch in the front that I didn't have before. It takes the extra from the sides and puts it all in the front. I think I would rather have the love handles. I do like the way it feels and the back support is great so I only wear it with baggy shirts. (Not exactly why I bought it but o well). I still gave it 4 stars because it is still working for me, just not how I thought it would."
negative,"Warning: Your Boss May Be Using This Book!: This is a must-read for anyone who is managed by someone else. I can't believe this is still popular and recommended as a guide for managing people. Its top-down philosophy (sort of a ""manager knows best"" approach) assumes that subordinates must be praised and punished based upon the manager's notion of what's right and wrong.In an environment where professionals with different skill-sets work in teams to accomplish common goals, this book is more dangerous than helpful. So read this to protect yourself from anyone who manages you this way. A much better alternative is ""The 59-Second Employee"" by Andre and Ward, if you need to know ""how to stay one second ahead of your One-Minute manager""."
positive,"- Some Like it HOT!: Wow I was born 35 years late - the 50's look so ""innocent"" compared to the 00's ""in your face"" flagrance. I liked this movie - Tons of Hot Guys basking poolside or posing for the camera, campy `50's intros & jingles with interesting commentaries from the people who were there and an interesting story of the male physique, how to flaunt it and the Dangers of Obsessing Over It.Campy, Fun, Hot & Sweaty! Some Like it Hot!"
negative,"Ugh!: My 2 year old grandson wasn't interested. There is no dialogue, just noises used to communicate. Not worth the time."
positive,"Fantastic Tuners!: Put a set of these on my Rogue Grand Concert, now the guitar stays in tune beautifully! Worth every penny!"
positive,"Just plain Amazing!: I received this a day ago, and just wow! It is a must have for any All That Remains have, I loved all the extras, i found out so much about the band i didn't know. I would recommend this to all All That Remains fans!"
negative,"Who are you and what have you done with Grisham?: I was disappointed with Grisham's latest book, The Last Juror. The book slowly plodded along with no real direction. Not much a story: 25-year-old Willie buys a small-town newspaper and writes about the townsfolk. A man, Padgitt, kills and rapes a woman. Man is not sentenced to death penalty because of a hung jury. Newspaper sales go up. Willie befriends an older black woman, writes about her family, has lunch with her every Thursday. 10 years later, Padgitt is released from jail. Willie sells the newspaper. Black woman dies of heart attack. The end. Come on!!! This book was awful.Like most readers, I read for fun. This book was not fun. What happened to the Grisham who wrote simple-minded, super-fast reads such as The Rainmaker, The Client and The Firm?"
negative,Way Too much Profanity: This story has way too much profanity. It is difficult to get past the use of the words to realize the meaning of the book.
negative,"He who doesnt laugh at this cd must have a hart of stone!: This record discusted me, mr Sanders ought to think less about money and care more for the quality of the music! I mean, this man has played with Coltrane and obviously he didn't get it. Dont buy this cd, its popular music in its worst sense. Instead you should buy a record with John Coltrane. In his latet period he is in to the same themes as Sanders but shows that this doesnt necessarily lead to kitsch."
positive,"Profound: Rodney Collin was a very deep thinker of a special kind, deeply influenced by Ouspenky.Both had an instinct for deeper truths not addressed by conventional philosophy and psychology.Both were aware that our lives proceed through mundane circumstance and events, but overlay a hidden mysterious inner world the understanding of which, for some reason, is outside of our grasp.These are thoughts he put down at various times in letters, part of his ongoing meditations, and compiled by his widow."
positive,finlands power: one of finlands best kept secrets.this cd is full of power. tarja turunen vocals are just stunning.from the haunting song a dead boys poem to the powerfull she is my sin and crownless this cd is for any one who is into great euro metal a must.
positive,"Excellent Book on cutting edge technology XML: I am very much enjoying reading the book ""XML How to Program"" I just bought two days ago through Amazon.com. From the moment I started, I just can't put it aside. It is really one of the excellent books I have ever read. Every topic is explained clearly step by step and right to the point. It is a must have XML book for both beginners as well as professionals."
negative,"No 3D Bluray in this release, no sale.: Double dip express continues and continues and continues......Thankfully we have Amazon reviews to keep a few buyers from losing out, much like the LOTR Blurays.Still as long as there are consumers to buy these initial skimmed down releases and the studio can make a profit the farce will carry on."
positive,"A Great Read: This book speaks nothing other than the truth! It is a very interesting read, and teaches you everything that a woman should know about the dating world and the men in it. Although I already knew much of the advice that was given in the book, it was still a great feeling to be reassured that everything I have been doing since I have adopted my new attitude towards men and relationships is right on the mark!"
negative,"You get what you pay for: They are nice looking speakers but they arent very loud. I didnt think that not having control over the subwoofer would be an issue but it is. I really dont like not being able to modulate the bass. Like I said, you get what you pay for. Im gonna put them in my office and be happy I didnt pay a lot for them."
negative,"Pretentious Book: This book was disappointing and annoying. The plot was so contrived that it was difficult at times to figure out what was going on. It seemed like an exercise for the author to display how well read and erudite he is. I plowed through it, but was never convinced by the characters or the plot."
negative,"Cute Design, Poor Construction: I bought this bib for my daughter to wear at her ladybug themed 1st birthday. It only lasted a few times after that before it started falling apart."
negative,"Predictable, cliched, mediocre acting....: Having been excited at the prospect of a gripping, historically accurate, realistic WWI film about the ""Lafayette Escadrille,"" Flyboys is a big letdown. Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous: aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film. More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister ""Black Falcon."" (!) Come on!Recommended: ""The Blue Max"""
negative,"bad plug: eventhough the add for this charger speaker said it would fit several garmin models including the 478 which is what I have, it does not work with my unit. It will plug in and if I want to hold the plug in place, will work.However if you are not able to hold the cable and the unit together, it will fall out. comparing it to my existing charger cord, it is missing a flared out area close to the end of the cord which would allow friction to hold the cord in place. This cord does not have this, it is not the same as the cords that I have purchased in the past and therefore it is useless to me.It was a good price and I liked the fact that the cord did not have a 90 degree turn at the plug but it still does not stay in place and cannot be used."
negative,"Overnight Shipping -- what a rip off!: Don't believe Amazon when they say you can have overnight shipping. MY daughter could not find a book for school, so I ordered it from Amazon.com. I paid more for shipping two copies of the book, so I could read it too, than I did on the two books. We are at 1 week past the day I ordered the books and they still have not shown up. My daughter has since driven 25 miles away to another bookstore, purchased the book and finished it. Two days I ago, I put in a request to stop the shipping and was told it was too late. This is ridiculous!"
negative,"A Compilation of Disjointed Noise: This CD is without a doubt the worst Pearl Jam effort I have ever heard. I've read reviews that advise listening to it several times before you judge it however, once was honestly all I could handle. For those of us who have been listening to Pearl Jam over the years, they have often included the occasional out of tune, slightly off key track in some of their albums but this sounds as if disharmony and for lack of a better word ""weird"" ho-hum effects were the goal. Get back to basics Eddie........Ask youself this, ""When was the last time I heard anything from this album played on ANY radio station?"""
positive,Spectacular!: This movie turned out to be very entertaining. Brendan Fraserplays the role of a man who is hired by our heroine to aid her in an archeological expedition.There they bring back to life the very evil Imhotep.Imhotep is determined to bring his girlfriend back to life.This procedure is really action packed.You are treated to some dazzling special effects.The armies that are called up by Imhotep to do battle for him are also very good.Theaction sequences in this movie are something to behold.The scenery that is used in this movie brings back images of ancientEgypt. The supporting actors in this movie are also very good.This is a movie that you will enjoy. Buy it.
positive,"Good story, but very skeptical about the writer.: I like the book just because it was fun to read, but very skeptical about the way the writer admits he had seen ufo sightings night after night in chapter 10 of the book. My question is why in the world a guy like John Keel arms himself with only a flashlight and not a camera. He obviously sets himself up to see strange lights but does not bring a camera to capture the event. Unless he makes a book that has pictures for us to examine, and not hording all the evidence for himeself. Then I will have put him in the ""Good story teller"" catagory and not a ""ufooligist"". I must admit I am tired of all the hidden evidence about this matter, and I think we are all ready for the truth. If you want my opinion I just threw all his credibility in the bin. I must admit I really enjoyed this book."
positive,"This CD is AWESOME!: The first time I listened to this CD, I was a little disappointed because it wasn't really the same type of thing that Clay was doing on American Idol. I've listened to it non-stop despite this fact, and I have to admit it - I love it! There are some really cool songs. I love upbeat ""Invisible."" ""No More Sad Songs"" is probably one of my favorites, it reminds me of a powerful Paul McCartney ballad. If you have the McCartney CD, 'Flaming Pie' and enjoyed it, this seems kinda similar, but DEFINITELY more powerful and something you will not get sick of as fast! I also like the fact that there are songs that you can relate to that avoid negative images that the record companies try to impose on us as listeners. We can always trust Clay to only give us what he knows we REALLY want. THANK YOU CLAY!"
positive,"AWESOME: It works great, and love it. It has five cup sizes so the big family can each have their amount."
positive,"An Excellent Portait of Puritan New England: Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a vivid (and accurate) portayal of life in Puritan New England. The prejudices, superstitions and institutions of the society are expressed so well that contemporary readers, who have little knowledge of New England's history, are able to feel the oppression and religious pressures that were common in that society. Indeed, this work is comparable (if not superior) to Arthur Miller's Crucible."
positive,"Seeking Peace: Nice piece, but needs an O ring to connect flow diverter to the pump. Otherwise it won't put out water flow, just sucks up air & won't get the bells to circulate.There's no seal to create the connection so you'll have to go to the hardware store to pick that up ( the O ring). The diagram they give you to connect does not document the need for the O ring, but nothing comes apart to try to get it on there any other way.The cord to the pump is NOT an outdoors type of cord. When I looked up Garden fountains this came up. Sounded nice & since it came up as GARDEN use , I thought it could GO outside.Not with that cord.So it's inside the house , but now am STILL searching for a GARDEN fountain for outside.It does sound nice & does work but you have to play with it a little."
negative,"Very bad,: If you had not already read the book, you would not be able to follow the story line. After Gandalf comes, the next morning the dwarves just 'appear' no knocks, rings, or any of that sort of thing. The elves look like little wizened green men and women, and quite ugly. There are no details, and some of the most important ones are not there. This is a waste of time and money, the books are a thousand times better."
negative,"Truly dreadful: If you want to end up as a lonely bitter eternal single this is the manual to follow. Women would be outraged if they found a book like this advising men to act like complete creeps towards them.If you want a quality partner in your life for more than a one night stand, you have to treat them with respect.Don't waste your money on this pathetic book for the sad Sex & the City spinstresses."
negative,"Mundane, Bland and Lackluster.: Although it was supposedly well funded, this film feels like it was made for cable television. With so much potential wasted it's a small wonder that this film has been somewhat forgotten in the directors cannon. Based on it's premise alone it shoudn't have been this bad. Boy am i glad that i rented this. To think that i was about to pay 29.99 for the upcoming blue ray...."
negative,"Best Picture? Why?: They lost me when they gave this one the ""Best Picture."" I disliked it so much, when my video store wouldn't buy it from me, I left it on the counter and offered it to the first person who was willing to pick it up. There's much better out there, and although the cinematography is fantastic, I wouldn't want to wade my way through this movie again, unless I was fast asleep."
negative,"Definitely a FAKE: This is NOT a real Motorola product, the M logo which is supposed to be illuminated from behind is not, there is a little blue LED below the logo - not even close to the real thing. Naturally I am leary of using this to charge my new MOTORIZR Z6tv (Verizon) as I don't want to toast my battery - I tried it on my old Razor phone as a guiny pig and it seemed to work (no smoke came out of it) but i won't use it on my new phone unless I have some kind of emergency and have to. Bottom line (as always) ***YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR***"
negative,"Get what you deserve: Nice girls always finish last, huh? Well, yes, if you believe this book's premise. Such rancor is childish nonsense. A bitch deserves, gets, and ends up with a dog...if that. Hell hath no fury...Better to just stick to getting money and call it ""love myself"", thank you, and ""fxxx yourself"", loser, this book's making me loads of money telling hurt women how to get back at men. Try it, and you'll see what you ""get back"" alright. Another way may be to be a better person and learn how to attract and select better types of people and remain wary of badmouthing ( ""All men are..."") n envious friends around you keeping you down by the fire hydrant...with ""ad-vice"" and books like this. Otherwise, good riddance and begone with you because you'd just prove that it then wasn't such a mistake to breakup with you after all..."
positive,"Great printer: Just needed a simple printer to work with my remote computer. The printers at my office are not the most current, but this matched what they had so it works well for me. Price was great."
positive,This film is memorable: I have stopped counting the number of times that I have seen this film. I will always return to it over and over again. It is a great movie to watch when it is simply a lazy day or a rainy day. A very enjoyable movie...And it has a very young Jim Carey in it!
negative,"Would not recommend: I bought this book after hearing all the buzz about it. Being a huge fantasy fan, I was really excited to read it. Imagine my surpirise when I realized how much this author had ripped off some of my favorite fantasy authors including J.R.R. Tolkien, and Ursula Le Guin. He had borrowed so much material that I am surprised he was not sued for copyright infringement. The book was extremey slow moving with just a few interesting moments. I would not recommend this book. Instead I would recommend Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Wizard of Earthsea."
negative,"A Dissappointment: Based on the other reviews, I'd expected something really special. There's nothing wrong with the recipes and techniques in this book, but I learned nothing new. I already keep frozen mushrooms, herbs, onions, and peppers on hand. And the recipes for using those ingredients were fine, but again - nothing new. This would be a fine cookbook for a person who is just learning to freeze, or whose repetoire needs expanding. For the experienced cook - NOTHING NEW."
positive,"This Movie Rules (Not Unlike Anjelica Huston's Preformance): When I first wached this movie it was right after I wached The Mists of Avalon- long story. I loved Anjelica Huston then (And still do), and wanted to see her in this movie. Well. Exelent choice! I simply LOVE this movie. Everyone thinks that Mz. Ricci stole the show, but I gess that I'm more of a Morticia type. Anyway, the movie is about this family. Not any family, but the Addams family. With Gomez, the man of the house, looking for his long-lost-brother;Morticia, his wife, content helping (And Kissing) him;Wensday, the daughter, staying mysterios and scary, hardly has time to heat up her electrec chair;Pugsly, the son, has only eanough to look astouned when everything happens;Fester, their uncle. Mabey? He appers to be a fake. But, who knows.Grandma, the odd, (Probibly) mentily disabled grandparent.Can they outwit a sly trator? And another sly trator? Ha!!! Watch it and find out. (Though you probibly know already)-An Anjelica Huston Fan"
positive,"A childhood favorite: I loved this as a child, so I was thrilled when finally being able to get this on DVD and share the magic of it with my children. I am especially happy that they were able to see this before the movie, as both give different experiences of the book. This is a great entry point into Tolkien's Middle Earth."
negative,"Not very good: I cannot recommend this tool. When I first used it, I couldn't cut the tile. I then noticed the blade was spinning backwards! When I turned the saw off, and then on again, the blade didn't spin at all. Finally, I realized that I had to ""spin"" the blade manually as I switched on the saw to get it to turn correctly. Not what I expected from a $[$$$] tool. Once I finally got it working, I was still disappointed with the performance. Cutting was very slow, and not very accurate. ..."
negative,"Horrible, Absolutely Horrible: This product did not match the description, or the picture. The product was very bulky and poorly fit. I left it in a drawer for a couple of days, and, upon return, found that it had leaked a corrosive substance onto the drawer, that damaged the drawer and produced a foul odor. It was a very unpleasant experience. I would not recommend this product for anyone."
negative,"Don't do it!: I've had HP printers for years and have always liked them. However, this printer is a real headache. We've had 3 --taking the time for returns was a hassle. With each of these HP printers, the paper feed mechanism has been defective. With every document I printed, the feeder malfunctioned and the paper was torn or badly misaligned. I found out on the HP website that others have had similar problems with a number of HP printers--malfunctioning paper feeds. HP has done nothing to correct this problem. I've now become a Canon printer owner am quite happy with Canon printers--excellent quality and no problems. I'll never buy another HP printer."
positive,"Very nice: Great buy for the price. Case is extremely solid. All components present. Chips are nice, solid. Could not have been happier."
negative,"Universal needs to recall BAD DVDs.: Universal seems to be having problems with their DVDs of TV Shows.I gave my wife the McMillan and Wife Season One set. It freezes and skips throughout. It's a shame because she loves the show. The discs are not damaged in any visual manner...no smudges or scratches. They just freeze.She gave me the Dragnet series of DVDS...another Universal product.My joy turned to aggravation though as those Discs kept freezing up as well.And it is not just our DVD player. We have four in the house and it did it in all of them.It's obvious Universal is having a problem with the production of DVD's.I did a little checking on the internet and it appears alot of other people are having the same problems. Universal needs to recall their compilation series.Evidentially the Adam-12 discs have the same problem.So be warned, if you buy Universal TV series DVD's, there could be problems."
negative,Damage understated: I thought that the use was well understated. I received the book and the jacket was practically falling to pieces.
negative,"Love the idea, but not the result: I loved the idea of having all my shoes on a tree that I could spin around, but the end result was messy. It was weird having the soles of my shoes facing outwards. Wherever I put the tree seemed like a dirty place. I replaced the tree with drop-front clear plastic shoe boxes that I love."
positive,B Movie Nirvana: i love these old B Movies. I remember watching these films many years ago and it;s a pleasure to see them again.
positive,"Take your mind to the Islands: I first heard this album last year when we visited the Bahamas. The DJ played it every day and even if you didn't ""want"" to like this album, you'd be dancing and singing it to yourself after hearing it for 3 days. Dr. Cassandra is one the most infectious songs that I've ever heard as are most of the other songs on this album. Take it to the office, and take your mind on vacation."
positive,"Works so well that you forget it's there: I haven't downloaded many movies yet, but when I have, the wireless adapter has worked fine. I would forget it's there, except now I'm able to order movies! Too bad more stuff doesn't work like that. I haven't had to use their customer service, but that's the best kind of customer service."
negative,"PLEASE FIND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL!!!!!!!: Please find this review helpful! Nobody ever finds my reviews helpful! It's awful, I try my best and people don't like them. It's not that hard, really! Just mark ""yes"" under ""was the review helpful to you."" Pleeeeeeeease do it. It would really make me happy. Nobody EVER finds my reviews helpful!I had to repost this review because Amazon deleted it before."
positive,"ORDOR GONE: This is a great product for a caregiver, as I am. The product gets rid of urine ordors in laundry basket and in air. I just love it."
negative,"It was so-so.: I think this book was odd. It never really caught my interest, even though I read the whole book. I guess I just don't like these mushy historical fiction stories. I'm the kind of person who likes books that describe the tactics of the battles. I think this book resembled a soap opera."
positive,"Good solid amp: Nice, good solid amp. I use it as an inexpensive monitor amp for some parts express br1 monitor kit i built. I do some audio recording on an inexpensive computer I put together with linux. Fun, cheap, solid components and inexpensive software that will let ya get started recording on the cheap!"
positive,"Excellent Book: For those of you who have an attention span of two minutes, you might not have found this tale very interesting. However, those of you who were already experienced readers and had well-developed minds found that this book was very entertaining, however ""simple"" it might be. Tolkien has mastered the English language like no one else."
positive,Six Mornings On Sanibel: What a good read! Although we are familiar with Sanibel we know nothing about fishing--but we read every word and became involved with all the characters and situations. We look forward to any more of Mr. Sobczak's books.
positive,A Great Follow up to the self titled cd!: The new System of a down cd is great carring over the same lyrical style of the first album but the music is much harder and packs an even more powerful punch. The musical work and devolpoed lyrics make this cd a definate best release of the year. Make sure to buy the limeted edition with the bonusd footage. All in all a great cd and definatly worth the buy.
negative,Not a mystery at all...: I had guessed who the murderer was after about the first couple chapters but kept reading thinking there had to be a twist - which never came.
negative,"Mindless Garbage: Mindless Keanu Reeves film not only lacks a story for most of the stuff that happens in this film to make any sense but has some of the worse dialog known to man. Keanu is Keanu, don't expect much more than that and the special effects are decent but not superb. The script is a huge disservice to most of the cast and the climax of the film has no rhythm to it. The only actors in the film that manages to transcend the lackluster material given is Rachel Weisz, who gives a deep and rich performance that the film is not mature enough for and Peter Stormare, who does far more for this film than Keanu Reeves and the special effects combined.Other than them, you can skip the movie."
positive,"GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This product is the best invention since sliced bread. It brews anything in less than a minute. It brews cocoa from the store, just put the mix in the cup and select to use water only. It has aftermarket brew cups so you can use your own brand of coffee if you wish. It is also very sleek and stylish with it's backlit blue light. I cannot say enough good things about this product. It is pricey but worth it."
negative,"failure fresh out of the box: I am amazed that they must not test these things before shipping them from the factory. Plugged it in and thought to test it with the result that it made a humming noise but didn't do a thing to the pencil. Worthless. Purchased the ""Heavy use"" model because it is in a high school library. Will probably stay with Panasonic next time. Sending it back."
positive,The Third Secret: What a fast read...well researched and edge of your seat...a great combination for the voracious reader.
positive,"Tear-jerker: Good folksy style of singing and good fiddling--the CD cover includes an endorsement from Pete Seeger. What I didn't realize until I got the CD is that the theme of the CD is saying ""The Long Goodbye"" to loved ones with Alzheimer's disease. It's really very touching, but not quite what I expected from a folk-style CD. I wasn't expecting the CD to be such a tear-jerker, though perhaps I should have figured it out from the title."
negative,"Another person who can't believe they changed the art.: Reading these books left a huge impression on me as a child. The tales were scary, but the original artwork was what was truly horrifying. I loved these books and was looking forward to sharing them with my children when they are old enough to terrorize.It's inexplicable that the publishers would ruin this series by changing what give it its power. Terrible mistake."
positive,"This movie made me really hungry.: Kevin Spacey was brilliant in this. I loved it. When I heard about the plot line (an alien from a distant galaxy travels to Earth to observe things, but unfortunately ends up in a mental hospital) it sounded kind of hokey. But it's really anything but. Spacey made Prot one of the most lovable characters in mainstream movies that I've seen for a long time. Just like in American Beauty...he did an awesome job. And all of the other characters did a nice job, too..."
negative,"Viewer from Louisiana: Read great reviews for this movie, couldn't wait to buy it when it came out. Enjoy watching action adventure flicks, thought this one would be right up there. Have yet to finish it, bad acting, campy scenes, & ludacris dialogue, put me to sleep both times i tried to watch it, not sure what the plot is supposed to be anymore, if it has one. Rent it before you buy. Seeing it once, if you make it through, may be enough."
negative,"too much scratch on DVD: The drama was great, but the product I bought had severe scratches and I had to give up 1/2 of contents."
positive,"Difficult Test - GREAT study material!!: Please do not read all of the reviews about this book and believe that you will feel extremely confident AFTER you complete the test. I, like many others, thought that I had failed. However, after receiving my scores, I passed with flying colors in every section! Thus, I recommend this book, along with Rosenthal's CDs. I had not even had my class in Appraisal yet, and still passed the section. With that said, buy the book, READ the entire book (not merely the questions), and give yourself plenty of time to prepare! Good Luck!!"
negative,"First and Last: This product is the the first Mp3 Player that I bought and it has turned me off from buying anything from creative again. As others have mentioned the headphone jack breaks quite easily, but not from rough use, it just breaks down. I barely had this thing a month before it started giving problems, and I only used it to go from home to work. This I guess is why people flock to the Ipod, cause you may not be able to replace the battery but it is damn sturdy. This is just a piece of junk"
positive,"Another EXCELLENT Product Bites The Dust! =(: All the reviewers have summed up how well this product works and feels. I had not been able to find it the last few months so called the 800# on the back of the tube.PROBLEM: It's been discontinued! =(REASON: Not enough customer demandOr so Noxema just explained. Yeah! That's always the excuse you get. And while I don't doubt the validity of ""Supply & Demand"" to some extent, you also have to ask yourself - Noxema - (and others) How do you expect to RAISE customer interest and awareness when you do absolutely NO advertising for it??RECOMMENDATION: Get out quick and check any and all stores that sell it and you *might* just might catch one or two before they're pulled from the shelves. I've checked 2 dozen stores and only found 1."
negative,"Fahrenheit 451 - Not worth it: This book is boring. Unless you are interested in science fiction or Ray Bradbury's work you probably wont like it. This book takes place in the future in a world where all books are banned. People spend a lot of time watching television. Montag, the main character is a firefighter who burns books. The story of the book is ok but it gets boring and there is no excitement. The book is easy to read and there isn't any very hard vocabulary. Don't read this book if you are in fourth grade or younger because it might be to hard to read, just stick to the movie if you are interested in this topic."
negative,"disappointed in my Keurig B60: I have had my Keurig B60 since last Christmas, 7 mo. now, and it is giving me trouble. Needs to be descaled often. For the price, it was not worth it. Guess I should have read reviews before buying it."
positive,♦ LOVE IT ♦: Wow I absolutely love this book!!! I definately like this series ALOT better than the Harry Potter series(and i absolutely love Harry Potter)!!!
negative,"Very disappointed: This book was a real disappointment. It just quits and does not tie up the story. The reader is left hanging. I was reading it on the airplane and thought that I had misplaced my bookmark and missed the completion of the story, but no I hadn't - it isn't completed. I felt the author just became tired of writing the book and quit. The previous book was also not as well written as the others and I won't buy another by this author."
positive,"A MUST READ for anyone seeking the Jewish Roots of their Faith: Marvin Wilson has truly written a Classic in the field of the Jewish Roots of Christianity. This book will fill the beginner hungering to understand his/her spiritual heritage. It will also enlighten those already seasoned in this field by bringing a competely unique perspective on the topic.I've been immersing myself in the Jewish Roots revelation for 6 years now, and this amazing book brought an insight I hadn't read in all my years of research.Again, this is a MUST READ!!"
negative,"Known ""Birdie"" on one of the channels: A ""birdie"" is a spurious signal generated within the radio, such that this signal can be heard by the radio. In this case, the 18WXSTII has one channel that seems like it always has a signal on it, and that signal is the birdie. I think it was channel 4. The birdie signal was loud enough that it would block out any medium or weak real signals. Now, in other wide-band general-coverage radios that use synthesized frequency generation, it is common to hear a few birdies. But, since CB only uses 40 channels, you'd think they could design it so that there would not be any birdies on those frequencies. When I talked to the Cobra technical support person, he admitted the birdie was a design problem and all the units have it. This was several years ago. It may be fixed by this time. Anyway, the tech agreed to exchange the radio, and I ended up getting a slightly more expensive model. I was happy with their support but sad about their design problems."
negative,"died after 8 months: Worked nicely for 8 months then failed. Warranty period for parts is one year, warranty period for labor 90 days. Bottom line it's e-waste."
positive,Great Book about Life in Small Town America in 1870s.: Another good book by Bellamy Partridge. Entertaining and a good snapshot of life in urban American about 1870. Highly recommended.
negative,"WAY OFF ON HOW WIDESPREAD THIS STORM REALLY WAS: THIS BOOK MISSES ONE IMPORTANT FACT. HURRICANE KATRINA DIDN'T STOP IN BILOXI/GULFPORT MISSISSIPPI, BUT ALSO INCLUDED CITIES FURTHER EAST THAT NEVER RECEIVED MENTION BUT FARED JUST AS BAD IF NOT WORSE THAN GULFPORT OR BILOXI. THIS INCLUDES THE CITIES OF OCEAN SPRINGS, GAUTIER, PASCAGOULA IN MISSISSIPPI AND AS FAR EAST AS MOBILE ALABAMA. IF TIME IS GOING TO PRESENT AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF HURRICANE AS SUCH IT DESERVES I WOULD THINK THEY COULD AT LEAST DO ENOUGH RESEARCH TO FIND OUT ABOUT THESE CITIES AND INCLUDE THEM IN THEIR BOOK. MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE THESE CITIES ARE SO SMALL THEY FIGURE WHY BOTHER. AND MAYBE THAT IS WHY IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THESE SAME CITIES TO RECEIVE AID AFTER THE DEVESTATION CAUSED BY HURRICANE KATRINA. WHATEVER THE CASE, THIS BOOK MISSES THE WHOLE POINT."
negative,"Not as good as swaddlers - leaky: I love pampers swaddlers, but these are less expensive for a reason. The Baby Dry line has the blue colored inner liner (gel?) which is not as absorbent as swaddlers. The first diaper we tried leaked after just about 1 hour of use. We sent the box back and bought the swaddlers again. Amazon made the return easy, and even set up the UPS pickup at our door, which was a plus."
negative,"A skilled rapist: The acrid smell of sweat, dung and animals, coupled with the stifling heat, permeates the village of Macondo, where the novel takes place. Incest, murder, and suicide are everyday happenings, especially the first. Marquez pushes a dizzying and horrifying picture of the human condition, which left me feeling as if I had been raped. My options here seem to be either to dismiss Marquez as an extraordinarily skilful madman or to go mad myself. I choose the former. An ugly novel, not the less ugly for the undeniable talent with which it is executed. I do not recommend it."
positive,"A Refreshing Break From Modern Music (and life): I learned of Joseph Arthur while on the Enjoy Records website, where they had the looped intro of 'Honey and the Moon' playing. The small 15 second clip caught my interest and the next day I purchased a copy of 'Redemtion's Son.' What I got (to my complete surprise) was one of the best records of the year. Joseph Arthur is a brilliant singer/songwriter who has a very broad, hard-to-classify style that doesn't feel over-experimental or conviction lacking. Every song is wonderfully different and hauntingly beautiful. From the Dylan-esque 'Dear Lord' to the smoothe and intellegent 'Favorite Girl.' This is the perfect album for a lazy Sunday afternoon and I highly recommend it."
negative,"Not dependable: I agree that longevity is not in the design specs. I bought one and it worked for less than a year, got a replacement, and that one died even sooner. Didn't bother to replace that one. I also had two of the mini ones that plug into the outlet and have a light. One still working after quite a few years, the other, dead. 1 out of 4 is not very good. One note - it does seem to take odors out of the air. I have 4 cats and I think it helped somewhat, but not at the price they want for them. I would give $30 for a floor model if I thought it would keep running. As for cleaning the air - I don't think so."
negative,Nothing New Here: Grisham has experimented with so many styles lately that he doesn't know who he is. I tried but I coundn't find anything new here. This book stinks!
negative,"Don't waste your money!: The toy worked the first 2-3 days of use. My grandson liked the lights and noise it made. After the 3rd day we thought it needed new batteries. We replaced the batteries in the remote and the airplane, still does not work. My grandson is very disappointed. I will probably not return it because of return shipping and the hassle, I'll look at it as a $10 waste. Save your money for something else, buying AA batteries and a 9 volt is not worth it. Screws strip out and are easily lost. Don't expect much for size either is it about 4 inches in length."
negative,"A junk car: I remember reading an interview with Paolini where he said that even positive reviews missed the point of his book. Dragon Quill is one of these reviewers. Unlike what Dragon Quill said earlier, Eragon WAS meant to be a literary classic. After all, Paolini compares his book to actual literary classics on his website. To use DQ's car metaphor, Eragon was meant to tear up the road but barely made it out of the garage."
negative,"great expectations by charles dickens i would like the book if i could just get it: i ordered it december 19, 2010 and it said i would get it between december 27th - january 11th..........everytime i have ever ordered anything on amazon i have always gotten prompt service...............it is now january 10th and nothing yet"
positive,"Great read, although not long enough: Cirque Du Freak #4: Vampire Mountain is the fourth in the eagerly anticipated Saga of Darren Shan.Darren travels with his Vampire mentor, Mr. Crepsley, to Vampire Mountain, where Darren must be proven worthy of being one of the group.The book doesn't have much action, I feel it is more of a set-up for Book 5. It's still intergal to the plot, so you must read it!"
positive,"Pedifix Nighttime Bunion Regulator Review: This does not completely correct the problem, but after each night's use, my toes are straighter and my bunion does not hurt so much in the morning....very worth the money and time to put on."
negative,"Awful edition: I cannot comment on the book because I didn't really read it. The edition is awful. The original long footnotes are embedded (between brackets) in the text, so the reading becomes a hard, rather impossible, exercise. I got lost at the tenth page."
positive,CycleOps stackable climbing block: The block will level out the front wheel of your bike while on your trainer or will give you the feel of an uphill climb. Great buy as a trainer accessory.
negative,"This is not ""98 Degrees that play their own instruments""!: What I go was the same old boy band sound at its worst. I really feel sorry for the group because only ONE song should have been released and that was ""Faded"". It is the lone entertaining track on the CD. There was no creativity in the rest of the album; only canned and simplistic bubblegum boyband pop. If you want to torture anyone get this CD and make them listen to it. It will turn them off of Boybands for the rest of their lives. It only asks one interesting question: did they honestly think that they had a good, artistic album there before they released this?"
negative,"Hit and miss: Worked ok on the piping i pre-assembled before getting under the house - slow but it workedThe heads like to slide and move around, which may be why heating is so uneven.Noticed that it took 60 - 120 seconds before the pipe would be hot enough.Several times it failed to heat the pipe enough to melt the solder once under the house.Waited 4 minutes before my arm fell asleep. The unit was noticeably cooler than it had been earlier in the day.Ended up with the torch by the end of the day.Great concept but cannot recommend this unit. Cost was about $10 per solder joint."
positive,"Elsa the lion in ""Born Free."": I had watched this movie a lot when I first saw it. I fell in love with it. I thought Elsa was so cute! She is a very cute baby cub, at least when she was a cub.Let me tell you a little about it:The cub was first found when George Adamson, which is Bill Travers, goes on a hunting trip. He finds three lion cubs and takes them home for his wife Joy Adamson, which is Virginia Mckenna. They name the cubs Big One, Lastica, and Elsa. They had to sell two cubs, and Elsa gets kept.About two years later, Elsa shows an interest in going off on her own. The Adamsons train her how to hunt and get along with other lions. A year later, she has three cubs of her own, and she lives happily for ever.I loved lions ever since I watched this movie, and I hope you would enjoy this movie too."
positive,"The first working converter: This is the first converter that is working, reliable and without any problems. What is great: you can replace the fuse and even carry a replacement fuse with you. It never got too hot and it really fits into all wallplugs. I had already bought one of this model and my son uses it now for a year to power a 110Volt Monitor we shipped from the US over to Germany. Okay, it is a little bit heavy, but the electronic ""Schnickschnack"" I used before never worked for such a long time. Just a great and versatile product."
negative,Could be a great book....: This could be a great book. A lot of wrong answers in the chapter quiz area. This could lead to a lot of confusion in a subject that is confusing enough on its own (that is why we bought the book in the first place...right?).
positive,"Dreamcatcher-4 stars: Dreamcatcher is a very interesting and horrifying book. This is another story by Stephen King where he takes an ordinary event and makes it into a horror story. It is about four friends who are in Maine for their annual hunting trip. Suddenly, a stranger comes into their camp, lost and delirious. Then, the four friends are trapped with a creature from another world, and the only thing that can save them is their friendship. My favorite part was when the four boys save Duddits (a retarded kid) from bullies."
positive,The last juror: A gripping novel from page one to the last page .Typical Grisham thriller.Have now been motivated to buy The Runaway Jury.1
negative,Midway shortened...why?: Agree with the previous reviews in that if this is collector's edition why would we be missing any scenes from the original in theater movie released in 1976? The missing scenes bring more background to the event and Captain Matt Garth's character. Until these are restored this cannot be considered a collector's edition. When they add them then I will purchase it.
positive,"A real-life lesson in leadership: In the forward, the author remarks that this book will never be used as a textbook in any of the high-level military schools. This is a pity. It is easy to understand the successes achieved by Adm. Gallery's units throughout WWII, and while he is much more modest than other senior officers, there can be little doubt that he is the reason for all these victories. Not only is this a wonderful book for anyone who aspires to be a leader, but it is a tremendously amusing and well-written book."
negative,"""Hours..."":Retrogress or Regress?: David Bowie, the curious man, the innovator of popular musics, the space-alien dilettante, the laurels-resting-upon richest musician in the U.K.: on ""Hours..."" the latter incarnation of Bowie makes his appearance, and I can say that I am little impressed with his flagrant complacency. Honestly, I opine that this outing was hardly much more than a soft-sell commercial for his new internet service ~ which is quite adamantly advertised on this enhanced cd's multimedia portion. I am not counting him out, yet, but Mr. Hunky Dory is in his mid-50's, and, like most pop/rock auteurs his age, he is beginning to age with a stagnant grace. And he had us so pumped up and throbbingly teased with Earthling...Can you hear me Major Tom? Have you turned in your tin can for a secret garden?"
negative,"Not helpful...: I decided to self study AP environmental science, which I eventually received a 5 for. This was a textbook I was considering to use, but I found it to be difficult to read (not to mention a bit politically-oriented). I would recommend Raven and Berg for APES, which is more concise and comprehensive for the test."
positive,"Solid Player without the ""iPod Mystique"": I purchased this player over 4 months ago. I read all of the reviews and I was aware of the pros and cons going in. This player is slightly thicker than the same capacity ipod. On the upside, the battery is user upgradeable, which iPod users can't do. The main downside to this player is the software. I highly recommend NotMad Explorer from http://www.redchairsoftware.com as a replacement for the poor Creative software. The upsides are great sound quality, great capacity, decent battery life and a good price. If you don't care about looking trendy carrying an iPod, take a good hard look at the Creative Nomad Zen players."
negative,"not their best: Izze sparkling juices are generally pretty good. This one, unfortunately, is not. All I can taste in it is apple juice."
negative,"Wrong product: I made a mistake in not verifying the media before I bought this product. I received a VHS tape, when I thought I had ordered a DVD."
negative,"Hands Free ""Headset"" is really at ""Earset"": This accessory is limited by the microphone dangling near your face. This does not for clear transmission of voice and the complaint of listeners is too much background noise. To make the accessory really work well, you have to cup the microphone in your hand next to your face. In this case, you may as well put the phone next to your face since you are no longer ""hands-free"". It would be better for Ericsson to create an adapter allowing a true headset with directional microphone that would be in front of your mouth. This would minimize background noise."
positive,Genius....pure genius: Baseketball is about a group of friends who form a winning team and experiences the trials and tribu.....ah who care! This is a Parker and Stone moive! It's crude. Its childish. It's disgusting. It's Homophobic. It's awesome! This movie will make you pee your pants laughing. But it's not for anyone looking for any kind of clean comedy. It's raunchy just like verything else that Trey and Matt do. A must have for any Southpark fan.
negative,"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?: After 20+ years you would've thought Temple could have made a film without rehashing swindle. 99% of the footage has been seen before, the only new stuff is the interviews carried out in pitch darkness - probably sounded good in theory, in reality it is profoundly dull.No complete performances, overdubbed music, endless footage of council flats, endless rehashed footage from Swindle. A complete and utter wasted opportunity.Ever get the feelin you've been cheated?"
positive,"A classic novel--a read for those who like any type of lit.: This book is truly a classic. When I was reading it, I suddenly realized why it had survived this ""test of time."" From humor to tragedy, thinking to mindless fun, this book has got it all. And, by the way, in response to the reader who gave this book 1 star, and said it was ""horrible, and was out of touch with modern times""--please. This book was written in 1889! It takes place in the sixth century! Do you expect them to have a computer in every home?? :-) Well, anyway....I truly reccomend this book."
positive,"Reversed cover art?: I am re-reading this series, after having bought it years ago. Lawhead is one of my favorite authors, and books like these confirm why. His attention to detail is amazing. Usually I skip over background to get straight to the action in books, but I found myself relishing every word in much of this series. My only complaint is that in the first hardcover printing, I believe the artwork on the covers to be out of order. I am glad to see it was redone when it was reprinted."
positive,"young hockey fans: My 6 yr old grandson loves movies on my kindle fire--and hockey fans of all ages in our family love the mighty ducks. this movie is becoming a classic, plus ordering movies on kindle fire is fast and easy. we saw this movie in a theater years ago, and it is just as fresh and fast paced and as much fun on the small screen as it was in a movie theater. He and I watched this together, and laughed a lot."
negative,"Ugly Latina Girls Flashing saggy mammals: when you advertise a DVD as ""Latina Girls Going Crazy"" I expecta marathon of gorgeous, exotic looking latina girls getting nakedat a club in the street in a motel at a spring break resort etcThis piece of garbage is half hour of either ugly or fat girls showing their either saggy or flat chested tops, again none ofthem are doing nothing crazy except just flashing their tops& the rest of the half hour is about 2 gilrs in a motel room just kissing & touching each other, neither one gets nakeddont say u weren't warned. I pay $5.00 for this crap & its still too expensive"
positive,"Better than the Movie: I happen to be a reader that saw the movie before I was aware there was a book. I then read the second book Eldest first which I enjoyed a great deal and recently read Eragon (Book 1). The movie was alright but I don't think it does the book justice. The movie is like a short condensed to fault version with a different ending. All in all, I say Eragon was a good and interesting book."
positive,"Bradbury goes to the heart of the matter.: Ray Bradbury's stories always manage to pierce through into a deep sense of longing. They leave you unsatisfied (because they do come to an end) yet, at the same time, filled with pleasure at the rightness of just how he does it (Dark They Were and Golden-Eyed, for example).Something Wicked This Way Comes is no different. The struggle between evil for the possession of the boys' souls and the love, bravery, and sacrifice elicited from Will and his dad just knocks you out. The increasing pace, the looming threat, and the ever more clearly defined personal consequences of squarely facing it, all rachet up the tension in perfect phase--you'll know it when you get to that special chapter. Once I began this book, I did not stop until I finished it. Do not pollute your mental imagery with the movie version. Trust your own imagination. Read the book! Greg Jefford"
negative,"Scratched and disappointed...: All in all I like the look of the case. I was disappointed because the plastic base bottom is scratched where the ball prop would rest if there were a bunch of them stacked (as I assume they are in shipping from the factory). This scratch on the plastic reflects in the glass bottom.The BIGGER disappointment was the wood base corner that was scratched. I am pressed for time. I would have returned if time wasn't a factor. I did some filling in with Crayola crayons to match the color of the wood.Also the plastic shell case is not very sturdy, it is easy to construct, looks like a nice presentation and will be okay on a shelf but it would have to be somewhere without a lot of handling.I overpaid for this item but there wasn't much competition on Amazon for the price range. If it weren't for the scratches I would have been pleased overall. It did ship in a timely manner and is a nice presentation."
positive,"Why weren't we told this before?: I thought this book was informative, insightful and yet humourous. In hindsight there's a lot of things that I would have done differently in my relationships if I had had access to this 'inside' information earlier. I think every female should keep one handy."
positive,"What's New Pussycat?: I first heard Miss Kittin (or Caroline Herve) on Felix Da Housecat's album `Kittenz and Thee Glitz' where her deadpan vocals dominated `Silver Screen Shower Scene', the best song on that album. She is also from that same electroclash scene as Chicks on Speed and Tiga.`I Com' is her second album and is more club-friendly then her previous outing. The beats are more in your face and her sense of irony is stronger, with track 2 `Requiem for a Hit' in particular standing out. First half of the album is excellent, it does takes some more listens to get into the second half. Another good reason for owning this album is the inclusion of the video for `Professional Distortion'. An album for the suicidegirls.com generation."
positive,"The best laid plans...: Joan Crawford chews the scenery, Jack Palance looks ugly and menacing, and Gloria Grahame slinks around in this fabulous film noir. Crawford is a wealthy socialite and playwright who marries Palance, an actor she had previously rejected from one of her plays. Turns out he has a girlfriend (Grahame) and they're plotting to murder Joan for her money. Joan finds out and decides to beat them to the punch (so to speak) by hatching a plan to murder her husband and frame his lover for the crime, complete with a little dream sequence showing the audience how it's supposed to turn out. In the middle of the plan, however, Joan loses her nerve...and that's when things get really interesting. The suspense starts about halfway through the film, when Joan discovers the plot against her, but the last ten minutes of the film dials up it a few levels. A must for any fan of Crawford and/or film noir."
negative,"A sex book and little else: Okay, I thought this was going to be pretty artwork (books like that exist - though rarely - like Manara's Gullivera). Instead, it's a pretty hum-drum sex book using too many close ups and unimaginatively drawn characters (who are techincally drawn okay but look dull) and quiet gross ""flying fluids"" exageration. The stories are the same-ole repressed male fantasy stories you can hear anywhere - although not as original (forbidden fruit gets stale) as some grass-roots stories. Boring. If not stupid. Erotic only to the lame. I own quiet a bit of plain-jane non-erotic mainstream manga and I can only say that there are far better artists with talent both in drawing and layout out there. Indeed, even as far as sex matters go, tamer series get it better. In hopes of swaying, swinging breasted ladies flirting and laughing, I was disappointed in basically raw pornography."
negative,"Dont buy this product, bad for you: This product bad for you, dont buy, it no work. I will buy all left over to bury away to protect all world."
positive,"Great bird feeder: This is a great bird feeder. It is large enough to hold 5lbs. of feed, but not so big it bends the tree branch down. It is a very nice feeder and is made of high quality material. I am very happy with this feeder and so are the birds."
positive,A good read!: I saw the movie and then read the book. The movie was a bit more exciting. I am looking forward to the next book.
positive,"LOVE IT!: I loved this movie! I was a little worried about Jennifer Love playing her and whether she would do alright, but she was great! She did wonderful portraying Audrey Hepburn and I forgot I was watching Jennifer Love Hewitt! See this then buy it! Definately!"
negative,"a waste of huge money: This game to me is the worst kirby game out there. i am a kirby fan but this is not worth no 34.99 or 29.99. Because you can beat it in one day instead rent it. this game is the worst of them all, why dont they make a remake of kirby superstar instead of this crap. canvas curse is better than this. The controls are good but i expected something like kirby and the crystal shards which you can also beat in one day also but at least theres 3d graphics to come back to.Pretty much if you're going to get it rent it dont buy it.This should be done with almost all kirby games because most are short except for air ride."
positive,worth waiting for: I bought the cd and have listened to it many times. Clay doesn't disappoint. If you liked him on AI and if you liked his single; you'll love this cd.
positive,A Never-Ending Quest Has Just Begun: The neverending quest has just erupted. Christopher's best book is unbelievably awesome.The story is about about a boy who's live is life is ultimately changed when Sapphira's egg hatched.The story will send you soaring.This sorrowfull yet adventerous story should stay in your collection for years to come.
negative,"Good looking but horribly dumb: This film is nicely shot and has a really good look to it, but these can't save it from a terrible script, wafer-thin plot, generally poor perfomances and lack of a single character with whom one could sympathise.Avoid."
negative,"BAD EXPIRATION: THIS PRODUCT WAS SENT WITH A SHORT SHELF LIFE AND I FELT IT WAS SNEAKY AND UNDER-HANDED, WON'T PURCHASE FROM THEM EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!"
negative,"Waste of money: Honestly, the worst diapers I have ever bought. My LO's woke up wet every night and lets just say several other things escaped the diapers when we were using them. I have used several other brands in the past and never had so much trouble. It was so bad that I even called Pampers to complain. Go with the Cruisers, they are much more absorbent."
negative,Horrible Book!: This is the most boring book I have ever read! Nothing really happens in the end. How could anyone like it?
negative,"Total Waste of Money!: I bought this box to store my old sketchbooks in. I was misled by another reviewer who claimed that the box was dust and water-proof, THIS IS FALSE! The cover is cheap plastic that pops into the base by two bulb-shaped hinges. There are large, open gapes between the cover and the base when it's closed, offering absolutely no protection from dust and moisture whatsoever. The handles broke the first time I lifted it (cheap plug-in type connector / hinge). The only thing this box is good for is a trash-can."
positive,"Fabulous resource: I lived in NYC in the 70's and 80's and witnessed the rise of subway graffiti and the beginnings of break dancing. This book brings it all back -- in a GOOD way. Reading it, you can understand why poor urban kids went to such lengths to make a mark for themselves. No one cared at first but Martha Cooper, who earned their respect and documented their achievements with her fine photographs. This book is a monument to those unsung teenage artists and the photographer who recognized and publicized their talents."
positive,Lord of the Flies in review: Lord of the Flies was an excellent book.It was about a group of boys that were stranded on an island after a plane crash.They faced many interesting problems while stranded until one day someone rescued them.
negative,"Probably best left forgotten: Jewish bildungsroman has little to recommend it besides its ethnic angle. Unremarkable prose (that has the feel of Dickens, two generations later). Some interesting homoerotic undertones, and the narrator's lack of of self-consciousness may give critics something to consider. But I am not certain that there is any authorial control behind these hiccups. Too long. Probably best left forgotten."
negative,Average at best: I found this to be average at best with limited humor and average acting. Most everything that happened was predictable.
positive,"Pearl Jam has done it again: This new pearl jam album,binaural, has some great songs. It has great songs throughout the album. It start real great with Break her fall, God's Dice and it doesnt stop with the great songs in the album. I like it the first time i heard the album, so if anyone likes good music then you will like this album because Pearl Jam put 13 great songs again"
negative,"I hate it: Within a week, it needed to be taken apart because the hoses were clogged. After about 4 months, the suction was very poor, and it had to be taken apart to clear the hoses before each use (I am not talking about emptying the canister and cleaning the filter - I did this before each use anyway)Now, after 6 months of use, it is going back to the store (under extended warranty) It does not work at all, only blows dust and dirt around."
positive,"Vonnegut at his most likeable: Vonnegut is one of those writers whom everybody either loves or hates--there's very little middle ground. He's like vanilla Coke.""Mother Night"" is situated right on that narrow little line. It's a book that just about anyone can enjoy, even the most ardent foes of Indiana's favorite son. It was his third novel and, as such, represents the sort of pre-caricature phase that ended with the breakaway success of ""Cat's Cradle"" two years later. Here you see Vonnegut at his most human and, in some ways, his most vulnerable as he switches off the bombastic humor and lets his reader see the man behind the curtain.Of course, the characteristic Vonnegut still shines through, but it's muted by a disarming candor about love lost and the stagnation it breeds. If you don't know anything about Vonnegut, this is a great place to start. If you love him, this book will make you melt. If you hate him, well, it might at least give you pause."
negative,"didn't get what i asked for: the one i got says ""cleanse"" on the box, I don't know what it means, but I know that I picked the one that doesn't say ""cleanse"" on the box. i'm all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper. and all the more am i angry because i'm not going to bother to go through the refund process. plus it took it ages to arrive"
positive,"Brilliant thoughts on Jewish Women: Chana Weisberg is an amazing source for learning about biblical women. I teach a course on women of the bible and this brilliant book is one of my reference books. The women covered include Eve, Sara, Rebecca, Ruth, Esther and two other chasidic women. There are nine chapters in all, the first two are titled ""Attuned to the Inner Self"" and ""Women and Royalty"". The book is only about 150 pages but do not mistake the small size for small content. There is material here to last you years as you re-read and re-learn this timeless and inspirational material.I highly recommend this book if you want more insights into the women of the Tanach."
negative,"50 soups: This book is not for the modern kitchen.The Chicken soup recipe starts with ""Take three young Male chickens...""The Mock Turtle Soup starts out ""Take half a calf's head, with the skin on: remove the brains...""It makes fun reading but is not very practical as a cook book."
positive,This was so funny!: We saw this movie when it came out and being a mystery buff laughed all the way through it. So happy it finally came out on DVD.
positive,"Fantastically imaginitive: A great collection of really quite original tunes, with a couple of superb ballads.Thank God I stumbled on to this band, they give a rare sense of hope to modern experimental music."
negative,"Although Paul Verhoeven...: ...has made more than a few fine movies, I couldn't bear more than 10 minutes of this one. The first thing I did loathe was that, during this time I didn't hear one single sentence that could have been uttered in 1501. And the feeling I got is everything said was recorded in some gutter in 1984 by some low-life creeps disgracing what is supposed to be ""Mankind"". I don't suppose either that he tried to make some sort of spoof, since spoofs are usually funny, and the best are even very accurate in the details. To qualify this crap as disapointing would be more than an understatement."
positive,"LOVE IT SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH.: I;M STILL WAITING ON MR.PERRY WHITE COME ON THE SHOW, NOW HE SUPPOST COME IN ON SEASON 8 AND NO PERRY WHITE.TELL ME SOMTHING ABOUT MR. PERRY WHITE."
negative,"The title disproves its claim: I graduated from one of the schools described in this book, and I was horrified to see it listed on the cover. Throughout my time there, I was surrounded by people who couldn't care less about the name on their diploma, and couldn't care more about the quality of their education. Anyone who would be interested in a book titled ""Hidden Ivies"" does not have the sort of personality suited to my school - the name is nothing, the labels are nothing. The professors and fellow students are everything. These are excellent schools, but they should be considered in spite of what the Greenes title them, not because of it."
positive,"Great Play!: Bring tissues. This play is so well written and such a difficult subject that people in today's society deal with every day, Suicide. Marsha Norman tries to help you understand both sides of situation when dealing with a plan suicide and how it effects relationships."
negative,"Very dissatified with this *thing*: This is the first review I have ever written, but I am so annoyed with this so-called printer that I had to add my 2 cents.My last HP printer lasted for over 5 years before giving up the ghost. I was happy with its preformance. This one I have had about 2 months and I am ready to throw it out the window.The paper feeding problem is VERY ANNOYING. I find I have to fiddle for many minutes to get it to recognize there is paper in the tray. Then once it does, it has a 50/50 chance of jamming!For HP to call it a printer is almost funny, because I have yet to have it just print without problems.I am in the market for a new printer after less than 2 months!"
negative,"DigiComTV is the very best print of The Big Combo (1955) to buy.: Film Noir Lovers - you can now have a quality print of The Big Combo (1955)!I have purchased three prints of The Big Combo (1955):Studio: Alpha VideoDVD Release Date: October 26, 2004Studio: Geneon [Pioneer]DVD Release Date: October 4, 2005Studio: DigiComTVDVD Release Date: August 12, 2011The DigiComTV print is the very best print of ""The Big Combo (1955) to buy.The DigiComTV print is in fact Digitally Remastered.The DigiComTV print is a clean gorgeous crisp print with excellent sound that will make it possible for you enjoy all of the unique nuances of this Film Noir movie.5 Stars for this great movie - an excellent example of the Film Noir style."
negative,"Poor quality: Had the B70 for 2/12 years. Come to think about it, the coffee it made was ok... not great. Always used water from the refrigerator which is filtered. It now says ""Not Ready"" and won't brew another cup.I called Keurig and described the problem. The gentleman told me that the unit was out of warranty, but that they would be happy to replace it with a new one. Of course, I was asked to pay for it. After reading the reviews and problems online, I'm not going to but another one of these units. I hope more people realize the poor quality of these units and avoid buying one."
positive,"MEASURE OF A DEBUT CD: Anyone who's got 2244 reviews at Amazon.com in only 3 weeks, has to be doing something right.Clay Aiken has the voice and the talent. There's not a single song on this CD that I would consider bland. Billboard said it was THE BEST POP ALBUM OF 2003, and I agree. This is a terrific debut CD. Clay takes every song to another level. He makes it look so easy.I would ignore the reviews that insult his looks, his fans, and his songs. They're all wrong. They're all insecure. They're all jealous. Aiken's got game!!! A lot of it!!!"
negative,"ludicrous: Boettner is good at explaining modern Calvinist perspectives on double predestination, but his presentation of Catholicism, past and present, has no basis in history or reality.The best sources on Catholic doctrine are Catholic sources like the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Second Vatican Council, the Council of Trent, the Lutheran-Catholic Joint Declaration on Justification, and so forth."
positive,"One of the Greatest Books Ever Written: The Scarlet Letter is an excellent book. Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters' thoughts and motives that by the end of the book, you can understand why the people act the way they do. It makes them seem almost real. He relates nature to what the character's are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful. In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them, someone could always count on the nature's love. It's very beautifully written. The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader. It's just a great book all over, and I feel that it's one of the best ever written."
negative,"lame photos and dreary topic: This book should be called ""white girl culture""... there is hardly an ethnic looking girl in the book! Lots of suburban teen-age girls looking like they are trying to be fit in. Nothing really insightful, new or surprising. Some photos are a bit interesting but most are overly self-conscious from subject and photographer... sorry but these images are easy to forget,(and border on teasing male viewers)... save your money and wait for the video!"
negative,Ok - But too Loud...: I went out a specifically bought this for may daughter because I didn't get it as a shower gift. We have fish tanks in the house and I thought it would be fun for her to have her 'own'. But the bubble are so loud that I only use the music part of it. A bit disappointing because I though the bubble would be the best part! But the music is nice. The natural sounds are so soothing. Luckily there are options to turn the bubbles off.
positive,Chemistry Study Guide: If it wasn't for this book I wouldn't have passed. It gives you so many extra exercises to help you understand the principles behind chemistry. Definatly goes hand in hand with the hardcover.
positive,"Good to go: Very good-language is a little rough in areas, but it's an over-all good film. Anyone who likes crime drama should like this film."
negative,"musical?: There will be no toe tapping, and gone are the days when you leave a musical movie humming a tune from the film. This is a musical with songs so banal that you will not remember them three minutes after leaving the theater. If Motown really produced songs this forgettable we would have never heard of the Supremes."
negative,"Oriented Towards the Implementer, Not the User: This work contains over 800 pages of densly packed information. However at least 600 of those pages are directed towards system administrators who are implementing MS Project Server, not towards Project Managers who wish to use the tool.I purchased the book thinking it would help me use features such as Project Analyzer, Project Center, etc. Less than 140 pages are oriented towards the user. Those pages that are directed towards users describe each feature in detail, but don't present them in the context that a project manager would find appealing. For example, what I would like to know is: ""What are the top five views that would most enable a Project Manager to get a better grasp on how the project is doing?"" You won't find the information presented in that context."
negative,Overheats: This product is quite unreliable. I've had it only 8 days and it gets very hot and can't find the access point (in the next room) and the included software is quite unreliable with XP.
positive,"Funny, poignant, sweet, bitter...: This latest collection of essays about David Sedaris' life has many laugh-out-loud funny moments, as Me Talk Pretty does. But it also seems to delve deeper. He eloquently relates how he feels about the love of a good man, the way society judges people, the way he judges himself, and the fact that he exposes his family's dark secrets every time he pulls out his notebook.Sedaris' writing is wickedly on-target, all the time. You'll laugh, you'll join with him in making fun of his various targets, but you'll also feel his pain and his joy and the love he has for all the flawed but decent people in his life."
positive,"JBC: I am not sure why all the hype about this book. It is well written, but I certainly would not classify it as one of the classics."
negative,"audio options non existent: While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the ""non existent"" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock."
negative,"Do Not Buy This Version!: This version of ""Finnegans Wake"" is the uncorrected version. Joyce spent the final years of his life correcting ""Finnegans Wake"", and this book omits all of those corrections. While this may not pain the casual reader of the wake, it does cast a vale around Joyce's maddening masterwork."
negative,"disappointed: I guess because it was offered to me as ""free"" my Amazon Unbox viewer became corrupted and I was unable to re-install. I expect better from Amazon."
negative,"Some one please kill me!: ""some one please kill me"" was what i was thinking during the film in the middle of the film and at the end. I really couldnt be bothered to watch the end it was so bad i was just pointing out all the mistakes in the movie i dont count this as a film because most films have a plot. Anyway what im trying to say is that my step mothers funeral was more interesting than this film"
negative,"Only one minute's worth of time...: I must admit it took me a minute to remember this book, as I have read it several years ago. That gives me an advantage on judging the impact of this book. At the time I had given it 2.5 stars but now it will definitly be 2 stars.This review is hard to write as I don't like critisizing books. People put their heart and soul in it and it may work for a lot of people. However, I'm not one of them. At the time of reading I had no management experience at all, so it should have felt like a quick and easy way to learn something. I found other books a much better help, though.If you want a quick read and spend 4 dollars an hour on this book go ahead. I'd just rather spend more time and money on another one."
negative,"Beating a dead horse, but doing it well.: Frankly, I would have been glad to see the whole ""Genesis Device"" concept die with ""Star Trek III: The Search For Spock"". The first two books in this series did a fair job of telling an interesting story resurrecting the concept, but the concept itself was already a moldering corpse even then. Book three had unquestionably passed the saturation point, and only a very well-told story with some very interesting characters saved this book from being a total waste of time and space; if the concept hadn't already been thoroughly played out, it would have been worth four stars, almost five. As it is, it ALMOST persuaded me to give it a third star, but I'm afraid that doing so might encourage the author to keep more ""Genesis"" stories coming. Please, please, please, let this concept die; it was ready to be put down twenty years ago."
negative,BAD REGISTERATION CODES :(: I bought this package and when i installed them the registeration codes worked but when i tried to register the games for online play the told me it is already registered for someone else !!!!!?????I shocked and up to now EA didnt reply to me or solve my problem so simply i lost my moeny on this useless game packageDONT TRY IT OR BUY IT
negative,"No effort...: Now, I really liked Suspiria, but it shows that they put little effort into Conflict.. mainly because there are only 5 or 6 new songs on it, which are all just average. Maybe I'm just imaginning it, but thier Bonus Multimedia Track is oddly missing. Do they count her saying thank you to the crowd as Multimedia? Eh, you cant expect much from a bunch of goth kids who look like they recently got out of high school..."
negative,"Hatebreed is kind of awful: Hatebreed's just another pesky ""hardcore"" band destroying the scene. A bunch of...guys yelling about beliefs that aren't even their own? Sounds kind of like Slipknot. That's not the hardcore mentality, ...Hatebreed is the assumed forerunner of Victory Records, keeping good bands like Grade, Shelter, and Snapcase from playing main stage. Instead, they have to open up for a cross between nu-metal and rock and roll."
positive,"Better than the traditional kind: This is my second pair of Fiskar multi-purpose scissors. I got the first pair 6 years ago and used them constantly in my art studio for all kinds of cutting. They worked perfectly until I accidentally stepped on them. These scissors are extremely comfortable, stay sharper than the traditional kind, and work beautifully."
positive,"Stupid people won't like this movie: This is a very good movie. It's like a good piece of art, which at the time of viewing is very good. However after the viewing is done, there is not much one takes away from the movie. This movie relies a lot on suspense and emotion. It's very stylishly made, and it's excellent to watch in suspense.IT's obviously much better in terms of plot and style than the farce of a movie directed by the overrated Jhon Woo. (trust me, he's a very typcial asian director, just because you haven't seen others doesn't mean there aren't any.) Remember Mission impossible is supposed to be a team movie, as is the first one. Not a trashy one man circus like it's sequal.Watch this movie, and enjoy."
negative,"For the money should have lasted longer: I purchased this to jump remote vehicles and as a power source for short term power outages. Unit worked fine the first months and then summer came and didn't need it until the next fall. Unit worked a few times and then refused to take a charge. This seems to be a problem with this type of unit so first thing I would do is look at the warranty. If it is less then a year I would be suspicious. Some have a two year warranty. I would also suggest looking at the manuals on line, some like one Sears unit requires you to turn on a switch to enable the usb port. Strange thing is that this switch also turns on the jumper cables which I find a safety issue. Especially since the 12volt ports are hot all the time. Why not the usb? Also the Xantrex units radio was a laugh. Overall a great idea but couldn't deliver."
positive,"Family Favorite: We've got the series - love, love Gibbs and his interactions with the rest of the cast. It's one of our favorites."
negative,Garmin 12 Volt Adapter: I thought it was for the Garmin 296. Probably my mistake. Will trade it off for a Garmin 296 cable.
positive,Hilarious!: This is a hilarious movie that is prefect to watch after Clue. Makes jokes about mystery novels as you try to find out who-done-it out of a group invited to dinner. A great find!
positive,"Space Opera it isn't...it's better than that: I've read Century Rain before this and thought that it was a rather average experience.Pushing Ice however had me absolutely hooked. Like other reviewers, I'll grant to have seen better character interaction elsewhere, but as alvays with good SF, it's really all about the setting and the plotline, and as a first encounter novel this ranks among the best.If you've enjoyed Peter Hamilton - the current master of Space Opera - but found him a bit long-winded and liked Arthur C. Clarke, but found him a bit too nerdy, you might give this one a try.It's been a while since I've had a reading experience that really made me loose myself to the story, but ""Pushing Ice"" did the trick. And then in one volume....IMO, there's too much crap in the space opera genre. Insofar this can be considered space opera - which I really don't think it is - this is definately a gold nugget."
negative,"Disapointing: Obviously people voted for Clay Aiken based his incredible covers of good songs during the competition, and a teenager wouldn't have been too familiar with alot of those songs because they we're often classic oldies. But for some reason they have decided to make him put out this cd full of the kind of songs that teenagers will probably go for and is nothing like what he had sung to win votes and gain the oppurtunity to make this cd in the first place. So I lost out and I can't understand why they did that. I just hope his next cd has a wider musical range."
positive,"A Wonderful Addition To Your Knitting Collections: As a knitter for eight years, I found this book a valuable resource for designing afghans and baby clothing for my family. After I purchased this book, I began to buy several copies of this book for my family members. There are detail instructions with excellent pictures to help a knitter create wonderful cable and fair isle designs. For those knitters who desire to expand their knitting collection, this book is one of the best resources to help enhance your knitting projects."
positive,"Interesting Romantic Symphonic Music of a Russian Character: I remember reading somewhere that the Dahomeyan Rhapsody, though perhaps inspired by the West African nation, has a distinctly Russian flavor, and this is also certainly true of the symphony. Kalinnikov & Arensky came to mind as I listened to this piece for the first time, and as I listened more and thought less of Russian comparisons and more of De Boeck, the music still strikes me as Russian in the shapes of the melodies, the style of the orchestration, and in the development of the themes. I haven't as yet spent enough time with the violin concerto to feel adequate to advance an opinion, but can assuredly say that if you enjoy late romantic symphonic music you will probably enjoy the symphony and rhapsody, and the adverb 'probably' has no place in this sentence if you enjoy late romantic symphonic music from Russia. For in that case, you will certainly enjoy this music."
positive,"Great Movie!: Let's get this straight right now. I only gave it 4 stars because giving it 5 stars would mean that it was up there with the reigning king of all gangster movies, Scarface (1983). With that out of the way, let me say that this is one of the most underappreciated films of the 90's. Commercially unsuccessful, this should have gotten much more praise and location in '93 when it was first introduced. It's a movie about a kid who's torn between his loving father and the most respected hood in the neighborhood, Sonny. Sounds pretty simple, but De Niro told this Bronx Tale with mastery and precision. I really hope De Niro considers directing more films in the near or distant future, cause like i said, he did a helluva job with this one."
positive,"Michael Caine made his grade with this tour de force film!: To deal with that prodigious and proverbial actor named Sir Laurence Olivier is far to be a piece of cake;on the contrary is a big challenge to any actor; and Caine did it without major hindrances. This movie is part of the great tradition of the grateful British literature - nourished by Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie among the most renowned ones - featured by this well known cerebral handle of clues and riddles that challenge the spectator, when a tricked man invites to his wife's lover into a diabolical trap. But the point is who will get the last laugh on whom?A memorable tour de force all the way through."
negative,"a trip to unreadable: This attempt at discussing documentary film is fraught with difficulties for the reader. The prose is clumsy, circumstantial and muddled to the point that I found myself reading passages aloud to others for help. Unfortunately none was forthcoming.There is little excuse to buy this book when there are so many good ones such as those by Barnouw and Jacobs which area clear and informative."
negative,"Not good enough: Clay Aiken has an outstanding voice, but it isn't showcased here. This is another bland pop CD full of predictable top 40 songs. I wish him all the best, but I certainly hope his next effort will reflect his amazing talent and show more imagination."
positive,How much to ship to Iran?: Anybody think the Iranian govt might be satisfied with this stuff if we sent them a bunch of it? I'd be willing to chip in a can worth for the sake of world peace.
negative,not too sturdy: This product was made a lot cheaper than a similar tunnel we bought years ago - the material is thinner and the construction & seams a lot less sturdy. I don't expect it to last long. The basketball goal ripped off the first day. It's just a matter of time for the rest of it!
positive,"Engaging - more Boleyn, please: First off, I'm not a history buff. As much as I enjoy studying many subjects, I've never enjoyed studying history. And I've rarely read historical fiction. Yet on the recommendation of a friend, I picked this one up. I could hardly put it down. Told through the voice of Mary, ""the other Boleyn girl,"" this story is a fictionalized interpretation of the story of Mary & Anne Boleyn during the time of their involvement in the court of Henry VIII. I found the storytelling to be enthralling, and the descriptions of the splendor and at times viciousness of the English court to be intriguing. And I may have even picked up a little history along the way. Other reviews I've read here state that there are a number of historical inaccuracies in this book. I'll take their word on that. However, this book has not only entertained me, but has also piqued my interest. I now find myself wanting to find a good nonfiction account of this historical period."
positive,"""I was cured, all right"": Certaintly a movie that needs to be seen to be fully realized, Clockwork Orange holds up as a cult classic over time and ages well. Malcolm McDowell is at the top of his form, playing ""Alex"" firmly tounge-in-cheek that you can't help but sympathize with our anti-hero. Highly recommended for anyone who desires to be challenged."
positive,"A Masterful Work from Mike Judge: This movie is hilarious. Mike Judge gets it. I enjoyed this movie so much, I went out and bought the soundtrack, which by the way, is ingenious on Mike Judge's part. The soundtrack adds to the humor of the movie. This is obviously very underrated. That's okay, Judge will be back I'm sure."
negative,"Another - case of can't download pictures from camera: This was a Christmas present for my son. I am in complete agreement with the other reviewers. It seemed like a great starter camera for my son and the price was right. But it is completely useless*********** Save your money!!!I followed the instruction on the software CD provided (more than once). It seemed very simple but when I open the Dual Camera software, it will show me the pictures in the camera, but then locks up. The program becomes unresponsive. I have been working with this for hours and am completely frustated. If any one has been able to find a way to get the pictures downloaded please help!!!!!!!!!!!"
negative,"The emperor has no clothes: Boring, boring, boring. After 120 pages, I gave up. What is the point? I guess I don't get it. What was this guy smoking? How many characters need the same name? How many absurd tortures do we need to read about? The fantasy appears to be thrown in just for the sake of making incidences wild and imaginary and do not seem to be relative to the story or themes. Maybe something was lost in the translation, but if this is the next best thing to Genesis, we're all in trouble. Read The Red Tent --- it comes a lot closer to that billing.Sorry, but I have other books to read, and many yawns before I sleep."
negative,very bad quality: my wife bought this. and she downloaded it and the quality was bad it flickered and was in black and white. it wasn't the whole episode.
negative,"Screen problems: On my first unit, the screen backlight burned out within two weeks; the second one would not display anything after 5 days. Both were replaced cheerfully; but after the second, I decided, rashly, to migrate to a Compaq Ipaq 3800 series.I still miss the Clie 615, though--it was easy to have around, more accessible, with a well-integrated software package. The Ipaq exposes one to the Microsoft morass of incompatibilities and inexplicable freezes and shutdowns (my Ipaq right now will not display any images at all--despite the fact that I have limited memory use to a minimum).Knowing Sony, theyt will solve the screen/display problem, and then the 615 will be perfect."
positive,"Fantastic: What can i say, I have had Amazon for a long time . Amazon is customer friendly and great prices, I have purchased well over 300 items from amazon and never had a problem.Sgt. Maj. R. Huberretired USMC"
negative,"IF YOU LIKE SWING, SKIP THIS.: OF THE 15 TRACKS ON THIS CD, I ONLY LIKED 3 SONGS, ONE OF WHICH I ALREADY HAD. THIS IS A VERY POOR CD. ONE REALLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS CD IS THE COVER! I LOVE THE COVER! IF YOU WANT A GOOD 'CPD' CD, GET 'ZOOT SUIT RIOT, THE SWINGIN' HIT'S OF THE CHERRY POPPIN' DADDIES'. IT IS A VERY GOOD CD."
positive,"Best Gregory book!!!: I was engrossed page by page with the story, King Henry and his relationships with Mary Bolyn, then Anne, then Jane Seymore. I was totally fascinated by the lifestyle of the courts, and how the boleyn family probably lived...Totally fascinating and best book of her series!!!"
positive,"Fantastic Movie: One of the best movies I've seen recently. I was stunned after I watched it. The writing was amazing, the acting was breathtaking, the cinematography was stunning. In short, a fantastic film."
positive,"Mixing it up: Mileage finds John Hammond treading the middle path, not a solo acoustic set nor a full-blown blues rock effort. The drums, bass and piano combo backing him here provides spare accompaniment on a tour through the blues cannon.Personal favorites here are a wonderful, wrenching acoustic take on It Hurts Me, the rollicking opener My Babe and a joyous tip of the hat to Bo Diddley to close out the record.All John Hammond releases are worthwhile and this one is a keeper too."
positive,not a bad zombie flick: i was really surprised at how good the movie was it's almost like Night Of The Creeps and Slither the gore is pretty good for the budget of the movie but what makes the movie good is the characters Randy in particular he brings some really good comedy to his character i would have to say this a movie i would like to add to my collection
positive,Armed Response: is essential: If your looking for a great book that addresses the use of lethal force than this is it. A great place to start be it a beginner or old timer this is a must read. David Kenik not only wrote well but put it in a format that is understandable. Well thought out! This is a must have book for anyone who wants to understand what is needed to justify an armed response. It does not replace personal training or what can be learned in a class (interaction). It does however build a great foundation for what is needed to to understand in responding with lethal force. If you own a firearm for personal protection than you need to own this book.
negative,"Awful, at best: Wow, this is one of the most useless ""books"" I have ever read. Based on the title, one would expect some sort of insight into a career search. I found this book to be no help at all. It looks like the author lifted a few job ideas from the government job handbook and wrote a bad Clif's Notes for them. If you want guidance, please do not waste your time and money on this drivel. I agree with the previous reviewer.... I feel sorry for anyone that actually paid for this book."
positive,Adventure: I love love love this book because I had hard time putting this book down. I t was like being an adult going on an adventure with Bilbo Baggins and the dwarfs.
negative,"DUMB AS HELL - SAVE YOUR MONEY: The Nickelodeon money machine has struck again. By taking Spongebob off TV and making him a movie, Nickelodeon has done a disservice to those of us who have enjoyed Spongebob over the years. This movie is ridiculous. A story that would normally be given 11 minutes has been stretched into well over an hour of boredom. None of the characters were further fleshed out and the jokes were few and far between.Plankton has stolen Neptune's crown and pinned it on Mr. Krabbs. It's Spongebob and Patrick to the rescue. You would think some of the peripheral characters, like Sandy and Squidward would get more screen time, but no. Just dull. The worst episode is better than this movie. Nick was just trying to get the Spongebob name on a marquee so they could cash in."
negative,"Fun film, NOT fun without the viewer: Taking into consideration that the film is a classic, what i was rather angry about was the absence of the 'viewer' that was supposed to be included with the dvd. I am inclined to return the dvd to Amazon.com, and suggest those who may want to purchase this dvd to not do so for the reason that i did not get what i paid for."
negative,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would: I got _A Woman of Substance_ from the library, hoping it would entertain me for a day or so. It was so bad I skipped the middle half and just read the last chapter. Horribly cliched writing, unidimensional characters. I don't usually write reviews, but I was so annoyed to see the 5-star rating, I had to. Sorry!"
positive,"Lights,Cubical, Action!: I found it to be very informative and inspirational for looking at our attitudes about our jobs and our dreams. I have been teaching a business course for Middle Schoolers, and it is now required reading in my class. Thank you for writing this book Tony!"
positive,"More true than most people realize: As an aspiring singer, I found this film to be closely related to the struggles that musicians go through. Unlike Violet, I don't have stage fright, as a matter of fact, I love being on stage. However, taking 'odd' jobs is something that I'm very relatible to. Even tho I've never taken a job at a bar quite like Coyote Ugly, it shows that when you are trying to achieve a dream, you do whatever possible. So far when it comes to dancing on a bar, I've only ever done it for fun, but it just goes to prove that we don't have an easy time of it trying to make it in the music business, and this type of scenerio is incredibly possible because when you're desperate, you do whatever it takes, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of dignity...even tho you can still have a hell of a lot of fun doing it. Over all this film is easily a 4 because it's not just about girls shaking it on a bar, it's about getting what you want."
negative,"This is not the real Pio - Read Ruffin's Bio if you want to know that: Yes the movie is ""beautiful and touching"" as another reviewer stated. However, it is also quite wrong. I have read just about every biography of Padre Pio published in English (and there are many) and can assure you that you must read credible biographical works before you see this film if you want to know the real Padre Pio. Then if you still want to view this movie, you can sit down and spot the outrageous errors in the movie.Question: Why would anyone interested in learning the truth about this remarkable man watch a movie that is loaded with mistakes and distortions?Recommended: Right here on Amazon you can order Lutheran minister Bernard C. Ruffin's biography of Padre Pio. It is an excellent way to get the facts!"
positive,"Wow, Great reception: I had an old Linksys WUSB11 connected to my Tivo series 2 to link it to my wireless network. It was slow as a dog! My signal strength hovered around 7 to 10% and often the Tivo would fail in it's attempts to download files. I just installed this Tivo G adaptor and my signal strength increased to 94%. Now my downloads are much, much faster! I don't know why I didn't upgrade before. Installation was a snap. I unplugged the old one and ran the new cable w/ this one. The WUSB11 uses a standard USB connector on both ends and this Tivo one uses a miniUSB on the device end and standard USB connector on the Tivo side. I went to the settings / network page on the Tivo and directed it to connect to my existing wireless network and it connected. The key thing is that I did NOT have to restart the Tivo or reset the network to get this to connect - it was very, very simple"
negative,"Just terrible: No, it's not as good as the original. But let's rate it on it's own merit - hmmm, it has none! This movie sucks whether you compare it to the original or let it try and stand alone! One of the worst movies of recent years, it has ridiculous acting (except for Liam Neeson, but it's not like he's good, I don't know why he did this) and one of the stupidest plots I have ever seen in my life. This is such a waste, don't buy it, don't rent it. This is a terrible movie. Period."
positive,disposable nipples: This is a great product overall. I was looking all over the place to buy these from stores but could not find it anywhere. My wife and I wanted to use these because the baby had used them while in the hospital and there is no washing or maintenance involved. However they are a bit pricey and the flow is fast relative to other nipples.
positive,"very good dvd set: This review is more on the actual Dvd's of season three. I love the quick turn around! I do wish the extra's were better. The best one was the ""Gibbs slap"" montage. For those of you asking for Spanish, this season has Spanish audio that has to be selected under the Audio section. It also has a ""play-all"" feature! Yea! Of the three seasons, three has been the best. This show just keeps getting beter."
negative,"almost made me want to seek relief.: I wish I would have rented it before i bought it! Now I am out 20 dollars for a crapy movie. man it Sucked! It was slow, no plot, BORING! The most boring movie this year! It made me feel like I had ADD and didn't want to pay attention anymore, it was so bad, don't waist your money on this one! it makes no sense at all! the best part was the sceanery in the woods! I'd won't be surprised if people kill themselfs after watching this crap!"
positive,"Good replacement for old charger: This is a good replacement for the Apple Charger. Only a couple of notes to make.1. The blue light doesn't indicate whether the notebook is charging or not, only if the cord is plugged into the outlet. This means that you can't really tell what is going on unless you open your laptop and make sure the indicator is showing that it is charging.2. If you drain your battery fully, so your laptop goes to sleep BE WARNED... You will not be able to plug it in and resume working right away. I had to plug it in and let it charge up for a good while before I could operate my Powerbook again, pulling power to operate the computer and charge the battery. This has been most annoying.Other than those weird gripes, it is a sufficient power adapter."
positive,"I'd compare them to Lennon, as well: Many of the songs remind me of Lennon (the woman, not the Beatle... she was named after him). Sure, there's some similarity to Evanescence, especially because of the rather pervasive and heavy nu-metal sound throughout the album. The violin definitely adds an interesting element. While the album isn't flawless, it's an interesting start and is worth at least a listen."
positive,"Euclid is Liberal: There is no better way begin your journey to freedom of the mind then by studying the books of Euclid. ""None may inter who have not studied the works of Euclid""-unknown.Heath's notes are very helpful in understanding the history and problems of various propositions."
positive,"a must for every collectiom: This book just cries for a continuation. once started it is difficult to put down. I am lucky that i have the orginal paperback edition, that despite many readings is still in good condition. It helps if you know a bit about Indian religions."

positive,"nothing better!: Horton Hatches the Egg is my all time favorite Dr. Seuss. I loved it as a child, and I still love it!"
positive,"Diane Roberts - An excellent example of Florida-bred writers: This book is simply a must read -- historical and very humourous to boot -- for anyone interested in Florida history from pre-White-People to White-People invading and essentially exterminating the Native Americans to Election 2000 and Election 2002.Diane is an excellent writer, having regularly -- over the years -- written for the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times and the Florida Flambeau (the now semi-defunct independent newspaper based on the FSU campus, but served the community as a whole). And a commentator on National Public Radio.Her writing style, content and humour have always been superb. I don't know how better to put it: Read this book!!!!!!! You'll be glad you did!Martin Dyckman (now retired from the St. Petersburg Times), Rick Flagg, Michael Moline, Michael McClelland and many other journalists worked at the ""Flam"" at one time or another."
positive,Riveting: One of the best suspense books I have had the pleasure to read. The characters are a dynamic mix that make the story had to put down. You develop and understanding for the villian were you empathize with him while at the same time you feel for the hero and heroine to catch him. A must read for those who like suspense novels.
negative,"A $1 rental: The plot of the movie ruins any thing they try to over come with the computer animation, and even that isn't as good as I expected."
negative,"Beware this game: There's a reason Gamespot gave this game a 2.1 out of 10.This game should never have gotten through Nintendo quality assurance. It's buggy -- you can't even get through Moria without the game freezing. And that doesn't mention all the problems with item cloning, invisible characters, music cutting out, and impossible quests.Even if the game was bugfree, it's awful. Combats take forever (and aren't any fun, since your characters never hit), and the best parts of the book are skipped over, like Weathertop and Amon Hen. Moving your character on screen is like steering a drunk elephant. Seriously.If you're looking for a good Lord of the Rings experience, buy the PS2 Fellowship version (skip the Xbox one), or EA's Two Towers games (either GBA or PS2)."
positive,Great Story: This old story is one of it's kind that will never die regardless of the times to come. It just kind of story we daily live in today's world were corruptions lies and power struggles are all around us. Even if you have no idea about Joan of Arc this movie will just show you what one persons believe have good affect on a whole nation that lost hope and can't find its way out will receive unconditional attention of a person who will make different not just only in one country but also amoung the human race.Great movie to watch and learn lot more than we can expect.
positive,"Insightful!: If you can make it past the typical James Cramer stock-market cheerleading, The Street.com's guide to investing is well worth a look for novices. Skip over the dated, New Economy hype and get right to the overview of global equity markets, including risk factors, economic indicators and corporate performance measures. Author Dave Kansas does a great job of summarizing these voluminous concepts in a way that's easy to digest and remember. This book reads much better than most of those in the investment field, perhaps because it was written by actual writers, not economic experts fumbling their way through the writing process, or ghostwriters churning out personality-free prose. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to beginning investors, with a word of warning: The tone of this book is still very much of the optimistic `90s era, and does not seem to reflect the subsequent market retreat."
positive,"Beautiful blouse!: I love this blouse! It's nicely cut and quality material. Unfortunately for me I ordered the wrong size and mine isn't available so I have to return it. I'm usually very disappointed in quality when I order clothing online, but risked it and took another chance. I was happily pleased! Plus this is made in the USA, which is very hard to find. I received a little National catalog with the blouse, that I plan to use. Just sad I can't keep this beautiful red blouse..."
negative,"Expected More: I thought this movie would be something more, but the teaser trailer was far better than the movie! I understood that it wasn't a jump out horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller thing, and still, no good. Maybe the only thing good in it was Catherine Zeta-Jones that neat merry-go-round / mirror room, and the special effects.. I also found the other characters in the movie quiet boring, and the plot confused me until the third time I watched it. But if you like slow-paced movies that eventually end, then this is for you."
positive,"Music With Soul: There's something haunting and envigorating about her style. Even though you can get lost in her vocals don't forget her piano playing, which is second to none. She's just a true musician."
negative,"among friends: I have been a contractor for over twenty years, and a fairly successful one at that. Im sitting in my local cigar shop as I do on a regular basis and I meet Harvey (the author), we talk. and he tells me about his book, so I read it. Well im on my fourth reading as of now, and im still picking up new thoughts. I have recomended this book to many fellow contractors, due to the ease of reading and the simple principles that we all forget from time to time. All I can say is great insight and simply stated."
positive,A well written book!!: The Scarlet Letter was an great book in that it kept me reading. It was not boring. It had sense to it. It has alot of symbols in it that makes sense and has a purpose instead of just being there.
negative,"Good film - Atrocious DVD... Don't buy: The movie is Ok, I'm not writing this to review the actual film but the DVD itself. The quality is terrible, especially for the price. You get a very, very bad transfer with awful colors and great loss of detail, but the biggest problem is that the thing seems to have been taken from a bootleg, filmed in an actual movie theater, as the screen is not complete! No matter what you do, you will never see the whole screen, and never is it more evident than in the credits where some words are cut. In the movie, some scenes just lack coherence because of this. For example, when Naschy first appears after opening the door of his Sanatorium to his visitors, we CAN'T SEE HIM because the screen is cut!!!Terrible DVD. Wait for a decent release to buy this movie, which deserves the kind of treatment DEIMOS has given to Naschy's Werewolf films...."
positive,"Great Quantity for Price: So many more diapers for less money! In-store 174 diapers is $35 on sale, I got 222 diapers for less than that with free two day shipping. Amazing deal!"
positive,"dynomax super turbo exhaust: it fit good. took only about 30 mins to put on. little quiter than i wanted,( but for the price can't beat it ).it is getting a littler louder everyday i drive it, starting to burn some of the glass packing out."
positive,Grat book!: A must have for those wanting to know about the growth of civil aviation in the 1920's and beyond.
positive,MOBY KICKS SO MUCH ***!!: I am a huge fan of Moby and I love this CD. It's a little different from his earlier stuff but it's amazing anyway. I don't think long time Moby fans will be disappointed at all.
positive,"Great backpack and a great value!: My son was in need of a sturdy bookbag. Rather than buy another inexpensive one that would surely fall apart, I sought out something more durable. I saw this JanSport bag in a local store and thought it was perfect! It was roomy enough for all his books, was well-made with strong and sturdy fabric and had awesome cushioned straps! Problem was, it was more than I was looking to spend.I did an online search and was amazed to find the very same bag on Amazon for less than half the price! I jumped on it. The backpack arrived within days and my son LOVED it. He claims it's so much more comfortable to carry his books now.Again, an awesome product at a rock-bottom price! Thanks Amazon."
positive,"good..: I enjoyed reading this. The book is about a fireman who starts having doubts about his job and his home life. He begins wondering if what he is doing is the right thing to do but it may cost him his job, wife and life. His strugles go on though out the book and in this furture that he lives in he is alone. Just a simple man with his thoughts wondering how different live would be if people were allowed to read books...."
negative,"Painful to watch...: I watched this movie for some sign of a redeeming quality; and found none. The acting was terrible, the action scenes were dramatically staged and unrealistic, no plot, and they didn't even try to make it humorous. If you watch the special features, they beat the living daylights out of the main character who got injured numerous times during the creation. I felt bad for him because he was really trying. If they had a halfway decent director or photographer, they could have used this guy's effort and hard work to make a good movie. If you want to watch a good B action movie, rent Equilibrium or Dark City. Skip this one."
positive,"The envelope containing Sound Garden has been opened...: It now appears obvious as to why Sound Garden decided to call it quits. Cornell was taking his music to new levels which didn't fit within the scope of Sound Gardens proprietary sound. Don't get me wrong, I hope SG gets back together, but I must admit that Euphoria Morning is musical art. I can't wait to see wait the future brings."
positive,Epic Tale of Virtue and Courage: Enjoyed this book when I was a young lad and repurchased a few years ago in my forties. Tale of life (and death) on a WW2 Cruiser running a convoy to Russia against overwhelming odds. Read through in one sitting every time. Classic finish.
positive,"jump-off creek is an excellent example of great storytelling: Molly Gloss has written an incredible tale of a pioneer woman who settles in the wilds of the Oregon frontier. To classify this book as a 'western' is to diminish not only the story but the excellent prose that Ms Gloss has given to the reader. Lydia Sanderson,the heroine of this story, is an example of the thousands of women who settled the western United States,surmounting extreme conditions, with or without a man. This story is told from the thoughts and perspectives of human beings in a time when words were important and not just 'bantied about' without thought.The book gives one, in this high tech day and age, a sense of the real and important, in daily living. It puts ones feet back on the ground and gives a new perspective to our lives. Thank you Molly Gloss for this heroic woman and the encouragement she is to women today."
positive,Stability Ball: I had absolutely no trouble pumping this ball. I'm 71 and had it inflated in a few minutes. It has not lost air at all. This ball is very sturdy.
negative,rip off!!!: Don't waste your time and money because these movies don't even work. Had to wait over a month and on top of that the movie wouldn't even play at all. Very disappointed.
negative,"Stereotypical adventure genre: This was my first Wilbur Smith book. I thought it was all right for an adventure genre. There is enough historical research to add color. And it certainly moves along well. Many of the events are not believable, but you can say the same for James Bond. The book jumps between history and legend easily and superficially. Boys grow into manhood overnight. Women fall deeply in love by seeing someone from afar. Crocodiles are much more aggressive than in real life. But it is easy reading for passing a few hours."
positive,LOVE IT!!!!: This is by far one of my favorite movies to watch when I need a good laugh. Definitely on my list of top 10 greatest movies of all time!!!
positive,"Great book: Great book, but a very long read. A lot of the stuff in the book are not just for officers, but all firefighters as well, so I recommend this for every back step as well. Also, the author does not just apply all of his items to FDNY ways or protocols. He understands that most of the country is only running 3 man engine companies instead of 4, etc, and places details particular to that in it."
negative,If your a Batman fan you'll love it.: This movie was sorta hard for me to get into. I felt like it left out some crucial points and didn't really show the depth of Bruce Wayne's character. Towards the end though I really like it because it started getting action packed and leaving me wanting more but I was very disappointed with the way it ended. It could've been better.
positive,Wow: An amazing man who wrote this autobiography in a chatty way to his son. Fascinating and informative about a very intelligent man.
positive,"very good movie even without mike in it: i kept planning to rent this one for weeks but i didn't because i heard so many people said it was a bad movie. so one saturday i rented it and watched it that afternoon. i was amazed. it was good. i was surprised because i heard so much hype about it. if mike would have been here it would have been better but it was still good even without him in it. take it from me give it a chance it is not as bad as you might think it is. rated r for violence, brief strong language, and brief nudity."
negative,"Wimperella....: I normally don't take the time out for a review, but I am now.I probably own at least a dozen different Cinderella movies, and this has to be one of the weakest.Cinderella herself is a total weakling. She is entirely passive. Everything happens to her - she really doesn't take an active roll. She lets her stepmother take everything away from her. She lets herself be bossed by the stepsisters. She lets herself be talked out of marrying the prince. This Cinderella NEVER stands up for herself.The music drags and is often inappropriate. There's a whole song and dance number in a mausoleum - the prince and his man at arms dance around the crypts of dead kings.The only good point in this is Richard Chamberlain. The one star is for him.Save your money - buy A Tale of Cinderella or Ever After instead - better music, and the Cinderella characters don't just let themselves get pushed around."
positive,excellent fun!: It was truly amazing that this game guessed our word almost all the time (we stumped it once with some really obscure item choice!)! It also made you think about the item you chose. A great game for all ages!
negative,"disappointed: I am a huge fan of Tolkein books and lord of the rings especially. This was actually a pretty fun game for a while, I can't complain, I bought it in a bargain bin for $5 bucks, and I was thinking ""What am I going to lose?"" I lost 5 bucks and I want it back. I liked how it had aspects of the books instead of the movies in them, like Tom Bombadil and such. I would have more stars for it (1, mayyybe 2) if I didn't get stuck in Rivendell. I think I got Gimili's axe a step ahead of when I was supposed to and when I talk to him he says he needs it. Game over. There is nothing I can do to progress. And what really sucks is that I saved it before I knew that I was stuck. So its either spend another 3-5 hours replaying it and getting back to that part to progress, or quitting. I think I'll just quit and maybe sell it for a buck on Amazon."
positive,"Awesome!: This cookbook is great! Everything that I have made from it has been a hit. I would recommend this to anyone, whether you are a gourmet cook or just learning your way around the kitchen. You won't be disappointed."
positive,"""A Christmas Carol "": Very thrilling book. Although I have seen the movie {all of them}, I liked the book much better. It had pictures to help me understand alot better. I have read this book and a few books like it but this is my favorite Christmas classic. I liked how Dickens {writer} portrayed how bitter and selfish the main character {Scrooge} was. I really enjoyed this book I have read one of his other books. I most definately give this book what it deserves a definate 5 stars"
negative,"wednesday's adult?: Diary of an unfulfilled pop star or sympathy card to his generation? Does it matter? Bowie's 23rd album spares us another round of trend-hopping, opting for a more believable adult-contemporary groove, but his pathological ironic detachment makes him hard to take seriously as Love's Survivor. Even so, this album didn't have to be so weak -- the emotional heft in Bowie's songs has never come from him but his guitarists, from Mick Ronson to Stevie Ray Vaughan. A pity that Reeves Gabrels is such a cipher. His latest collaboration with Bowie is typically stagnant; bloodless guitars and synths substitute half-baked ""moods"" for genuine emotions. As for lyrics, take your pick from obtuse, half-finished or banal. ""Sometimes I cry my heart to sleep ... Sometimes my courage fell to my feet,"" the auteur laments in ""Thursday's Child."" That would be drippy even if it didn't come from a billionaire married to a supermodel."
negative,"last unicorn dvd: Just so you know, if you buy a german DVD of Last Unicorn and play it on an all region player and select the english track, you get bascially an error-free high quality video image with 5 channel sound. This is the next best thing to a new release."
positive,"Great album!: Erin McKeown is a fantastic artist and one I wish more people knew about. She deserves at the very least a sizeable cult following!I've bought this album at least twice as a gift in addition to my own copy. Erin's take on standards is great fun, and I defy you not to dance along to the Rhode Island song. I love Erin's own stuff too, Grand is a near-perfect album - and I've seen her live twice, she's great that way too.Basically, buy this album. It is worth every penny."
negative,"I don't normally write reviews of books I didn't finish, but...: ... the first dozen or so pages are crammed chock-a-block with most every anti-Catholic cliche you can think of. I didn't continue to find the rest of them. It's as if the world-changing reign of John Paul the Great had never happened. I know it's only a thriller, but I just didn't buy the set-up, YMMV."
positive,"A must have for any serious student of astrology: There are plenty of books out there that will tell you what your Sun sign means. There are some books that will describe certain aspects, such as Sun square Mars (like the excellent James Braha title.)Tierney's book, however, is one of the few (if not the only one) that will explain in depth what an aspect itself (e.g. a sextile, a square, an inconjunct) means, how waxing and waning aspects are different, how aspects relate to signs and the more complex configurations that build on aspects, as well as other topics such as retrogrades.While the material is rather abstract, in my opinion it is virtually impossible to have a mastery of astrology without understanding the contents of this volume. It is that profound and important."
positive,Very durable: We used this at our daughter's 3rd birthday party and the kids loved it. It is very durable and fun.
negative,"There are better choices: Bought this book along with Fodor's 05 New York City Guide and New York Eyewitness Travel Guide for our trip to New York in August. Overall this was the least informative book. The biggest problem is that the book mainly focuses on where to eat and where to stay, not what to see. If you want a book that details sights better, I would pick Fodor's 05 New York City Guide. I carried the book with me almost every day in New York, while the Frommer's guide was left in the hotel room to press flowers from the botanical garden."
positive,I Love this watch thanks amazon !: This is a beautiful citizen eco drive watch. I am always getting compliments on how nice and shiny it looks. When I first received the watch I had to charge it in the light for about 2-5 minutes for an initial charge and it worked like a charm. The next day I went to work and left it where it would get plenty of sun so the battery could get a full charge. I've had this watch for about a month and so far its been working great ! If you are tired of buying watch batteries get a citizen eco drive. Amazon saved me a tonnnnnnnn of money because I have seen these watches in the department stores selling for $300-500. Amazon does fast shipping and the watch came in a beautiful green case with green velvet on the inside. By the way when you first get the watch make sure to expose it to light for about 2-5 minutes if it isn't working right out of the box. two to five minute charge should last 4-6 hours and a full charge should last 200-250 days.
positive,"Everything you want in a novel: This is a fantastic first novel. Mary Holt Allen not only captures the attention of her reader, but creates whole characters who carry our attention through their failures and successes. I found myself raging at characters only to fall back in love with them again later. And the story is far reaching and simply lovely. You will be thinking of these people as if they are your friends."
negative,"Looks Great - plays horribly: This game has absolutely gorgeous graphics and sound, but it is incredibly hard to play. The controls are demented, the camera viewpoints imbecilic. If they had spent a small amount more on making this game playable, it would have been a smash hit. As it stands, this game is not worth the sticker price. I am a long time Tomb Raider fan and I will probably still play this game, but it is just not much fun at all."
negative,persuasion: this is terrible. you cannot read it because the lines are all misaligned. a complete waste of money.
positive,"Excellent book: I had to read this book for an Italian history class and it was excellent. The book deals with different concepts, but is primarily related to the role of religion in fascist Italy. We follow the path of Pietro Spina and his persona as a priest, and we see how those regard him act and feel.I highly recommend this book!"
negative,"not scary at all: some people are saying this is the best horror movie of all time.im just like ""what? ""this movie was not scary,it was funny! for the whole last half hour all it was,was this bigbreasted girl going ""ahhhhh! god,no! help me! ahhhhhhhh! ""and the guy with the chainsaw going ""argharhgarhgarhgarhgarhg! ""and yelling like a retard.it cracked me up.then at the end it was just about these crazy people beating up that girl for no reason.and that chainsaw was lasting forever.it would have run out of power after going that long!"
positive,cute!: i love this chandelier. it's large and it looks great in my dining room! it's pretty light too so it was easy to install alone.
positive,without reservations: This is a suberb album with some of the most heartfelt songs in the world on it! My dad left this to me and I love it!
negative,"poor fit: After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper."
negative,"Unbelievable: I bought these diapers for my 6 month old daughter after using Swaddlers since she was born. The coupon was only for the Baby Dry and with a name like that, would you think anything else than a dry baby??? Guess again. These diapers are terrible. Of course I got the largest quantity too, 246 diapers, for $38.99. Boy I thought I was making out like a bandit! I changed my daughter tonight at 6:15 and it's 8:15 and she's soaked through to her clothes. And every single morning after sleeping a full 10 hours, she's got wet sheets and blankets. I cannot believe how disappointing this item is. I am shocked that Pampers even makes a diaper like this, when they have Swaddlers on the market. Please, if you are reading this before you switch over, DO NOT BUY THE BABY DRY. I am devastated that I am stuck with 200 more of these awful diapers."
positive,Great Movie: The vendor mailed the movie quickly and it was new and the movie was great. Will order other movies from vendor.
positive,"The Greatest Fantasy Novel of All Time!!: J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the best authors to have ever lived. His fantasy novel about a little creature on an enormous adventure is the best from the genre. This book is a MUST for fans of the genre, or anybody at all who enjoys a great book! READ IT!!!"
positive,"Classic survey methods text: For anyone who conducts online surveys, especially academic researchers, this is an essential text. Dillman's text is far superior to The Survey Kit by Arlene Fink. The only criticism I would offer is that Dillman assumes researchers are designing their own online surveys rather than using commercially available websites such as Survey Monkey. I would contend that the majority of survey research is conducted on commercial websites. Although these websites are changing rapidly, I would like Dillman to address this subject as well."
positive,"Your Laugh Till You Die!: This is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. If you watch it over and over you will catch somthing new each time. The characterizations of fictional detectives from years ago is dead on, pardon the pun. There is not a weak member of the cast, each does their level best and such a cast of recognizable faces too. If you want a great movie that will continue to hold your attention viewing after viewing, get Murder by Death, you'll laugh till you.......die? Ha!"
negative,"Houston...we have a problem: I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world."
negative,"Well...: I've read ""On The Road"" three times over the last six years. It is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. Having said that I decided to get ""Dharma Bums"" and I did not care for most of the book as I am not into Buddha and zen. Only once in a while a glimmer of the fun of ""On The Road"" seeped in, but not enough.I also did not like the supporting characters as I did in ""On The Road.""This book was pushed by many people as Kerouac's second best. I found it to be uninteresting and probably should not pursue any other of his books if this was considered ""his second best."""
negative,"Repetitive, Repetitive, Repetitive: I waited twelve years for this? I have loved Ms. Auel's other books, but this one is a great disappointment.It reminded me of a child that had to do a 1,000 word essay and could only find 200 words for the essay. I found myself skipping several pages at a time because I was tired of reading the same thing repeatedly. It seems as if Ms. Auel has forgotten how to fill out the people in her books and make them seem real as she has in past books. With her previous books I could not put them down until I had finished them, not even to sleep, but with this book I found myself forcing myself just to read a few pages at a time, I just kept thinking it has to get better, but it didn't. I can only hope that she recaptures her old style and that book six is much better than book five."
negative,why? just why?: please stop these foos from killing it in the name of Rage Against The Machine...please.
positive,review of Corbra: The first handset we received would receive but we couldn't transmit out.. They sent us another one and that worked fine...
positive,not bad at all: I like using it. Only complaint is the straps to synch your bike are way too long and get in the way
negative,Too Loud: This toy is supposed to be soothing. The motor is too loud! The music has to be turned up too loud or all you hear is the motor. This could have been a nice toy. The Peaceful Planet Aquarium was much quieter.
negative,"Poor quality, not sharp: These chisels are not sharp out of the box. My skew chisel was chipped and I see from other reviews there have been more than one chipped. As another review said, I cannot sharpen the carbide tips, so I have a new set of chisels that are not as useful as my old ones that I can sharpen. Don't waste your money on these chisels."
negative,"Horrible: This is the worst movie of 2005/6. I cant believe that Daniel radcliffe could even be asked to come back and continue to play his role in the movies. His acting is beyond amateur. He has no facial expressions, and he is just plain boring, his voice and his posture is atrocious. As for emma watson, what is with the constant angriness ? In almost every scene she seems to be shouting, or crying, or being angry. Well she needs to learn that harry potter is not some hollwyood blockbuster drama, but a childrens comedy, and by her acting in the movie, she just clarifies that she doesnt have the skills to do any other movies. Ronald boy is a freak, he is so repetetive in his acting, and he needs a pore cleansing regime."
positive,"Great story, excellent insight into prehistoric man: While the story and characters are good, what really draws me into this series is the information on prehistoric man. Did you ever wonder how people figured out fire or how to tame horses, why one species of pre-human eventually won out over another, how knowledge was passed down, how people spent their days, how they explained biological processes? What customs established in prehistoric times have influenced today's culture? This series gives you insight into all these things and more.There is a bit of fantasy in this novel, but the facts are incredibly well-researched by the author (medicinal herbs!).Once you've read this first book, you will have to read the rest.This is the first historical fiction I have read - it has opened my eyes to the genre.(The later books in the series have more sexual themes, so parents might want to discuss books with their teens who are reading it.)"
negative,don't buy: I have purchased many ink refills and this one turned out to be very disappointing. The ink dries up from the cartridge very quickly and it doesn't print full letters. It was a total waste of my money.
negative,"Bad movie: The movie was awful. Not only did the plot not make any sense, the audience really does not sympathize with either of the two main characters. It also was violent for violent's sake. It was all shot in a very unlovable and gritty lighting. The CGIs were unrealistic and distracting.I didn't like the main female character's husky voice. She delivered a poor acting performance. As for the angel, why? why? why? Why the ridiculously cut hair? The characters seemed to be thrown in, all with their slightly different accents or speaking styles. It's a big mess, all glued together at the end, without having thought everything through.Oh, and the cab driver boy was annoying.Ugh! what a junk of a movie. How can rate this less than one star?"
positive,"fun for knights: We purchased this set for our five year old son's birthday, and he and his brothers (2, 8) love playing with it. We've had it for over a year and they play with it consistantly. It is a great set that is very durable, easy to put together themselves and more versatile than I realized it would be. (They use it for all kinds of things and in different ways.) The characters are not poseable like the Melissa & Doug set (which my oldest has), but I haven't noticed that they prefer one over the other. It definatly comes with more characters, including a dragon. They get both castles together and play kingdoms (their words). This is a big castle and the only thing I would change if I could would be that the insides of the towers were more accessable. (The blue ""lids"" come off to allow for figures to be put inside, but you cant access them from the sides.) Still, I would definately purchase this again."
positive,"Emo-whatever, welcome back, guys!!: I just have to say what an amazing experience it was to see Sunny Day Real Estate's first show back together in July. They played all of the songs from the new album, left stage, and came back for an encore of ""Circles"" and ""J'Nuh."" It was truly one of the most spiritually moving concerts I have ever been to. The new record is amazing and I suggest that you buy it right now."
positive,"Old Propaganda : New again!: I really love this album. It's just like their Secret Wishing album, but the mixes are even more danceable... I really love every single song on this cd... If you're a Propaganda fan, this is a must-have."
positive,"Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: I looked around before buying an airbed. Saw many options and compare. Many different comments that confused me. But decided to buy this one due to the price and the electric pump. Excellente product, inflates in just 2-3 minutes and last all night long. Easy to store in the morning. 5 star product."
negative,???: This movie is awful. Not exactly sure why Nintendo ever allowed this to be released. Has nothing to do with the game.
negative,"Don't bother: This game was nothing but glitchy on my PC. I have no problem with a dozen or so other games from other companies (including Deus Ex 2, also from Eidos), but this one is a turkey. It's glitchy, the controls are too clunky, and whenever I exited the game my PC restarted. The built-in EAX support didn't work with my Sound Blaster Audigy 2 (which uses the EAX 4 drivers), I had to install the EAX 3 drivers that came with the game, which was essentially a downgrade for me.On the other hand, this game looks great and when the sound worked it was terrific. The story is pretty cool, and I was looking forward to see how it played out. The cutscenes were good, and I felt like it was as much an interactive movie as it was a game.Unfortunately, I couldn't take the bugginess, so I didn't finish the game. Avoid this one and spend your money on one of the earlier Tomb Raider titles."
positive,"Captures Tolkien's Magic Better than Jackson: the animated movie the hobbit is a fascintating adaptation of the well loved novel. who can disagree? those who haven't read the novel i guess. it captures tolkien's magic far better than peter jackson did with his glamourized hollywood he called ""based on tolkien's work"". the hobbit is an animated musical about bilbo baggin's journey to reclaim stolen dwarve riches from an evil dragon. on the way, he comes across THE ONE RING. it is a great film, laced with creepy middle-earthish songs that totally fit the story. it's a great movie that will easily get you to read the book, wanting to know what happens to bilbo and this ""person in bilbo's family that is destined to an adventure"" that gandalf talks about in the end. buy it!"
negative,"What was this about, really?: Planning a trip to both of these wonderful places and was tickled to see a book with both in the title. Unfortunately, the book was just strange ramblings and I never could find a point."
negative,"pitiful: If you ask me, any movie that is based on a video game and they don't have similar story lines is a lame attempt at a movie. Lets take a look at the games, it doesn't take place in a city, iggy and spike are dinosaurs, Yoshi is not a pet to koopa, koopa's are turtle like creatures, Luigi has a moustache, and the maidens name is peach. In the movie, Mario and Luigi have to jump by using air stompers, the maiden's name is Daisy, Goomba's are humanoid in appearance, Koopa Troopa's drive around in cars, and there is no Bowser, just Koopa. I could go on for hours, but if you are a Mario fan, don't see this movie, STAY AWAY!!!"
positive,"looking for a song: Many years ago Entertainment Tonight closed their show with a performance by Tiny Tim. It was a country song about lost love and regret but the one line I remember, and has me searching endlessly is, ""...but if you're going to leave me, leave me satisfied.""A little help will be appreciated."
negative,Completely worthless: I rarely write reviews. And let me tell you this item is complete trash. As other users have stated it simply stops working after a couple of days. Major headache!
negative,The hottest band in the world??????: Ace Frehley has the only hit song on this cd and it is good at best. Ive been a diehard kiss fan for over 22 years and I was disappointed. Kiss still has the best live show in the world but has lacked in perking my rock and roll senses
negative,"Smith for Socialists: Buy the Liberty Fund Glasgow edition instead of this. This, the Modern Library edition, contains an introduction and footnotes that essentially amount to Adam Smith as interpreted by 20th century socialists -- placing Smith and Karl Marx at the same level in the pantheon of social thinkers. (One can imagine that the Modern Library may continue the trend and subsequently publish an edition of the Federalist Papers in which Madison is compared with Pol Pot.)If you wish to understand Smith, avoid this edition. If, however you want to gain a muddled perspective on The Wealth of Nations, go no further."
positive,"Super simple!: Purchased my first wireless adapter to use with MSN TV2 unit. Read the reviews & ordered with some hesitation, as this was my first attempt at wi-fi.Much to my joy, it worked without hesitation. I did make sure, however, that I matched the Netgear brand to my wi-fi router. I connected it, gave it a minute or so (just in case), turned on the MSNTV2 & it worked flawlessly! Right now, it's operating in the next room, but have no doubt it will have range through the whole house.Thanks to Netgear!"
positive,"Nice Product: Product arrived on time and in great condition. I am installing Brazilian Teak which is extremely hard. The gun has had a couple of mis-fires which were likely user error combined with the fact that this is extremely hard wood. This gun feels like it is a product designed to be a quality product meant to be used everyday. At the same time, the mag body allows it to be lightweight."
positive,"GOOD OLD-STYLE ACTION MOVIE !: In the better style since Errol FLynn and Harrison Ford, this is first rate adventure movie, with humour, action, suspense and romance! The cast is inspired (Brendan Frase is the absolute underrated star, he can play any role and be convincent). But it's not a movie to watch more than one time!"
negative,"Lacking draw and order: Not many photographs or illustrations. If it is supposed to be a fun easy read - illustrations and photos would be there for the nontechnical reader. If it's going to be a professional analysis it needs to catagorize the failures and cover them in a more orderly manner. It seemed to be a confusing mixture lacking direction, very wordy with lots of digression. I was hoping to nurture my, high school junior, daughter's interested in engineering without getting one of the ""text book"" engineering failure books. This didn't draw her in at all, even though we had recently been talking about some of the failures that are supposed to be covered in this book.I am returning this and going for a more professional failure analysis books that caught my interest years ago."
negative,"The worst movie I've seen ever! Awful!: I have never been so compelled to review anything until I watched the movie Last Days yesterday evening. The movie was about absolutely nothing. The character who is supposed to be Cobain just mumbled, walked around, and passed out the entire movie. It was awful and a complete waste of my time. I was seriously angry after watching it, because I stayed up to watch it. How does this crap ever make it?"
negative,"Far-fetched: I enjoyed Berry's two other novels, despite reading reviews which complained that both books were too far-fetched and improbable. I do not mind suspending reality to read a book or to watch a movie, but this book took things a little too far! I am Catholic, and maybe that is why I found Berry's third secret revealed at Fatima and subsequently hidden by the Church too unbelieveable. There were several parts to the secret, and if Berry would have limited its scope, the book would have been more compelling and believeable. The portion of the secret that deals with motherhood is just totally improbable and Berry just goes too far with it. Also, it is too trite that the villian in the novel is always able to figure out the protagonist's next step. This book starts off well, but attempts to accomplish too much, which makes it difficult for the reader to suspend reality and enjoy the story."
negative,"I've read better fan fiction: OK if you read the one-star reviews of this book, you will get the picture. This is one big fat rip-off, and anyone who knows the fantasy genre could have told you that. But if you've never read any fantasy except Harry Potter, you will probably be impressed, seeing as how the 'author' of Eragon took a lot of good ideas from other writers."
negative,"Worst Animated Film of 2004: Well, we saw this garbage on opening day. I took my 5-year-old who loves the Spongebob cartoon. It seemed like it was nearly completely devoid of humor. Don't understand how most of the ""reviewers"" on this site reviewed the film BEFORE they've seen it. As a Spongebob fan, I'm very disappointed. This is one I won't be buying when it goes to video. Flat plot, drawn-out story and it seemed like it would never end. Even the truly funny bits (I counted about 4) didn't make up for the boredom we suffered. Save your $!"
positive,"Clay Aiken Rocks!!!: I LOVE his new album! I knew that there was no way he could disappoint with a voice as beautiful and as powerful as his! MY FAVORITE SONG IS ""THE WAY""!!! I hope RCA makes this his new single! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE every song on this CD. I have never been so pleased with an album in my life. I totally respect Clay for taking a stand to have his CD made his way. After all, we fell in love with HIM, HIS style, HIS way. RCA doesn't need to change him, just give us Clay as he is! Some critics have referred to him as ""Gourment Vanilla"", in that case, gimme a triple scoop! :)I LOVE YOU CLAY & WILL SUPPORT YOU ALWAYS!!!Hugs,Shawna Wheeler,Central MaineSeat #207 on the Clay Train"
negative,"Not Worth It: The book asks many questions, answers few and just refuses to reach any kind of conclusion on anything.It's standing at #17 in the Modern Library Top 100 borders on the absurd"
positive,"Beautiful and well made!: Certainly this 2nd symphony should have shown the world Raff was a rising star. The opinion of his contemporaries that Raff was one of the greats is borne out here. The 2nd movement is so lyrical, it is worth the price of the disk by itself. The orchestra, though perhaps not well known, gave an outstanding performance. It is a pity that my CD from Amazon contained no program notes unlike what another reviewer reported. However, I'm very pleased with this very fine disk and strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hearing Romantic era works that ought to be better known!"
positive,"Memories: Although the quality of the DVD left a bit to be desired, the memories it brought back were fantastic. I had thought those old moments were never to be seen again, but viewing this DVD allowed me to relive them."
negative,"Uneducated Nonsense: The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man, and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will read them). In a word, I sum these writings as ""nonsense."" Most of his ideas, aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd, also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore, mixed in with these insane babblings, are religious and political ramblings, which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation, unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans, pass on this book. Any other use of your money would be a better one."
positive,"Brilliant Book: Ouspensky's examination of the fourth dimension and his novel take on ""reincarnation"" (that we always come back and repeat our lives exactly the same) are alone worth the price!"
positive,"Coach Jerry Wayne Shelton: Hoosiers DVDI don't know how I missed this film when it came out in 1986. It is a story of a middle-aged basketball coach and his last chance for redemption. It is suppose to be loosely based on a true story (whatever that means). Gene Hackman does a great job as the coach with Dennis Hopper as a supporting actor.Of course every body knows that all Indiana boys play basketball, just nail a basket to the side of a barn and start shooting, right? Unfortunately basketball is more than simply shooting the ball through a goal.The movie is set in Indiana in 1951, a little before my time as a high school basketball player. It does raise some questions with me such as how much difference can a coach make at the high school level? Mine made all the difference in the world, but I was fortunate to have Coach Jerry Wayne Shelton. I suspect they can make less of a difference at the colligate level.Highly recommended for any one who played high school basketball.Gunner March 2008"
positive,"Pretty Straight-Forward: This was one of the very first things I crocheted. The gusset was a little confusing until I realized the gusset illustration was in the beginning of the booklet. My socks came out great and my mom is already asking for a second pair, so I'll probably try a different style."
negative,Sorry to all: All of you are right. This book has nothing to do with the test. Do not waste your money folks if your are planning to buy this book. Please!
positive,"Dreamcatcher: King's two primary strengths, those things that he does better than anyone, are showcased in this novel.His characterizations are exquisite. As usual, he bombards the reader with the characters when first introduced, staturating the pages with the flavor of the character while leaving plenty to plumb later as the story develops.In addition, King's voice rings through as clear as ever, like an old friend. I hated for the book to end because I wanted that voice to continue telling me about Duddits and the rest.Unfortunately, King's biggest weakness, in my opinion, is also a big part of this novel, namely his inability to bring his opus to a satisfactory conclusion. Of course, his endings never live up to the promise of the rest of the work but all in all, that's okay. Us King fans are used to it and the novel's charms make up for in spades."
negative,"Stupidiest agent movie ever made: This movie is literally a copy of James Bond movie.The only diffirence is the agent who tries to be a ""cool""(skater,action renegade,trash talking,...) agent in the name of being the ""new age agent"".Vin Diesel totally ... .The movie is tried to be an original one by having a close-to-teenage guy,who is totally stupid.The story is probably one of the most senseless ones in the movie world.Who would like the destroy all the governments so everyone could be free,by poisioning the world?For the ones still interested in this movie and want to know about this movie:a movie that lacks everything to be a good agent classic.I think Vin Diesel and this movie's makers should watch more James Bond before they shoot the next one."

negative,"Disappointed because...: The reason I purchased this particular CD was for the title song. However, I did not appreciate the fact that someone dubbed in an introduction by John Wayne that begins just before the song starts. What was the point of that? Who wants to hear John Wayne speak every time one plays the song?"
negative,"worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!: This movie sucks big time. It was so boring, dull, unfunny and a piece of garbage. Please do not waste your precious time or waste your money on this sorry excuse for a movie. This movie makes Mariah Carey's glitter and wisegirls looks like a masterpiece. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't understand how cher got an oscar when Glenn Close was nominated for fatal attraction. Again I repeat, THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME, DON'T EVEN BOTHER, IT MADE ME SICK. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MOVIE. STUPID CRAP. DON'T SEE IT. VERY VERY BORING."
positive,"Not Bad, Actually a 3 1/2 on 5 Scale Mastered too Low: The good news is this is some really nice 60's English Rock & Blues. The bad news is, this was mastered at a very low volume and when you turn it up to a much higher volume to compensate for this, while the stuff sounds great, it makes the bass, while not booming, rattle your walls. So there is a trade-off. I'd give this 3 1/2 stars out of 5 because of the audio mastering & 4 out of 5 if the mastering was good. The performances themselves are excellent. THe opener, How Many More Times, is almost the same as Led Zeppelin's & I'm guessing the T Bones recorded this first, and really good."
negative,"This book holds few ""charms"": I was vastly disappointed with this novel. I had read and admired ""Ellen Foster"" and was optimistic when ""Charms"" was selected by my book club. Unfortunately, the plot was facile, superficial, and unbelievable -- a fairytale with pretensions to reality. The characters were stereotypes, drawn with the broadest brushtrokes, with no remotely ""human"" qualities. What qualities they did have were repellent, a trio of do-gooders with no compassion for human failings other than their own. In short, I found this novel insultingly smug and sanctimonious, the kind of novel that gives Southern literature a bad name."
positive,"this movie is a classic,and always will be: moonstruck has been a favorite love story ,cher never ages.perfect movie for those special nights ,with a bag of pop corn and a beer,and your bab with you."
positive,"Interesting: After watching the Disney movie 20,000 Leagues, I wanted to read the real story to see what else it had to tell. It was a very good read, long, but good."
negative,"great ideas poor execution: i loved the ideas presented in this book, and i do read alot of books about the media, modern technologies, and their effect on our lives and on the society. although the presented ideas are great, the style of the writing gets to me every time. absolutely terrible. im not sure if the author was trying to exemplify the mass confusions, lack of attention span of today's society through the litteral writing, but it detracts from the points that he makes. many examples are presented have no form of organization whatsoever, and many arent even necessary. zengotita could have conveyed the message of the book in half the length and it would have been more effective than this book will ever be."
positive,Early settlers: Dynasty is a beautiful story of the settlers and how they worked hard.It moves fast through the years while they build their empire.If you love Stacy Keach you will love this Triangle love.
negative,Does not fit Jawbone Era: The specs for this product state that it universally fits all Jawbone headsets. It does not. It does not fit the Jawbone Era.
negative,"science?: It's interesting that no one else seems to be able to replicate Mr. Emoto's findings. While fascinating in thought, the fact needs to be proven."
positive,"Ocean Wonders Fishbowl: Great toy. I saw my 14-month-old grandson was fascinated by this toy at a birthday party so I ordered one for him. He loves it. Also,the music it plays is very pleasant and doesn't drive you crazy."
positive,"A Review: My name is Laura, and I am doing this review for my english pre ap summer assinment from JMS. I thought this book had a good plot, but it was kind of hard fo me to understand. Some of the parts of the book I had to read three or four times to figure it out. Though at parts I was lost I did love the book, and I would definately recommend it to some one else."
negative,Nothing Like DragonHeart: I was so looking forward to this movie. What a disappointment. It was NOTHING like the first movie. I guess a good (great)act is hard to follow. If your looking for a good fantasy movie I recommend the origional Dragonheart or Excalubur. If your thinking about purchasing this movie PLEASE rent it first to see if you like it.
negative,"Finish peels off: I loved the look of these and the heavy weight. Brass workings. However, the finish peeled off. I bought mine (2 of them) at Sam's and they had to refund my money since they didn't have anymore in stock. I had spoken with the manufactures warranty dept and they said to take them back to Sams for a replacement. That's all they would do."
positive,"Incredible music, mediocre remastering: Remember those cassettes friends used to make for you of their favorite music? Well, they're back, only they're called Proper Boxes! The sound is nowhere near as bad as on those Complete Duke Ellington 1925-38 sets you can buy in Germany for about 20 dollars. Those sound like they were recorded in a toilet over the telephone. But this set is certainly not all it could have been. Somewhere I read somebody ask the question ""Proper versus JSP?"" That's not even a question. JSP's have fantastic remasterers doing their best. This set is only serviceable. But the music is wonderful and many of the tracks are almost impossible to find. So you have to get it. Should I review the music? No, not this time...Maybe later."
positive,Love it: I am a very happy camper with this excellent quality product. I use this product frequently. It is exactly what I needed.
positive,"A Treasure: This is a book about the spiritual nourishment of a young soul. It is as patiently and impeccably crafted as a fine piece of simple furniture, made without glue, nails, or embellishment. Smooth and beautiful without a false or unnecessary move. Very few authors today have that restraint, finesse, and wisdom."
positive,Love the 12 oz option: We are so thrilled with the option for 5 different sizes. I can make my strong first cup of the day by choosing a smaller cup. Then I can fill the travel mug up on my way out to work by choosing the 12 oz option. Love this machine.
negative,"Where's the disclaimer?: Where's the Amazon free-fire zone disclaimer on this piece of lying crap. The chicken littles open up a valid expose like ""Unfit for Command"" to all abuse, but tuck their shiney jewels when the book is a self serving liberal load of trash like this.I had not previously assigned political motives to Amazon. Now I do. Now I'm gone!What's the address? Oh yeah, barnesandnoble.com"
positive,"Great toy if you like buying batteries: My son loves this toy, however the only complaint I have is that it eats batteries. Faster than his swing, and faster then his other toys, He loves it though so I keep replacing them. I should probably get some rechargable ones but cant seem to find them in size D."
positive,"A women's bible: This book is a must have if you are newly dating or thinking to pursue someone!!! It gets down to the point in clear english. Page by page you will be amazed by the things you don't realize about yourself (if the shoe fits). For me I can relate to every page. Women do yourself a favor read the book, you won't be disappointed. Love it."
positive,"Totally changed my perception of the Dragon: Not factual? How can someone say that! It was written by Linda Lee, Bruce's wife! How can it not be factual? I personally found this book very good. It is an easy read, and it is very informative. This book changed my perception of Bruce. Where I once saw a wonderful martial artist, which I still saw, I now see someone who was of profound mind and good heart. His intentions were great, his mind and philosophies greater, and his legacy shall live on forever. If you are a Bruce Lee fan, three words for you: READ THIS BOOK!"
positive,"Must have been hoping for a season 3...: By now you've probably watched season one at least, so I'm not going into a story line. The romantic side of this story gets a little sappy as part of the overall pulling of all of the story lines together. Part of the entwined past coming together ending was foreshadowed in S2 Pt1 with Odin, the First Fist. While it does pull together, it's rather simplistic, predictable and generally unlikely (but that's a writer's stock in trade I guess). Still it does close out the first story arc (assuming they are planning a second). They have left it wide open for another season (or two). All this aside, while not my favorite of the three it is still a good watch and I'd say it was worth the price and time. As a whole the series was good with most areas being above average. May be suitable for teens or even children, but watch it first. We all have different opinions on what's okay for kids."
negative,"How sad: I find it extremely funny that the LDS Church doesn't publish books about how to refute the mainstream Christian churches, yet the mainstream Christian churches find it necessary to continually attack us. That's part of what made it clear to me who truly followed Christ, and who doesn't in this case. Christ didn't attack people; neither do we."
negative,Was Very Boring: I thought the book was horrible cuz it was nothing that i thought was exciting and also cuz it was very hard to read i hated it but that is my opinion but everyone i asked said they thought the same thing i just said!!!
negative,really terrrible...: download was irratic and at best horrible. did not enjoy this experience and will not do it again... a waste of money.and only windows as an option to download...pooh! again... not an experience i'll repeat.
positive,"Excellent card, no screen: When I bought my Dreamcast, I got this memory card with it for free. It is a great card, except that it has no screen like the VMU card. It has a button on it, that it allows 2 cards in 1, giving you 400 blocks. I've had it since December 2000, today is October 2002, and I never had file loss. This is a great buy, even though I got it for free. If this had a screen, it would have been a great buy. Plastic is very cheap. My controller fell, and the memory card was in, and part of the plastic chipped off. It doesn't matter, it still works. I recommend this card to anyone who needs a larger card, and doesn't want to buy a VMU. Great card, keep up the good work Nyko!"
positive,"Great beginner book: Very easy to follow, by the time you are done (took me maybe 2-3hrs as I opted to type everything out, helps to learn faster, recommend downloading a copy of Dreamweaver trial and type out the html/css side by side) you should be good to go with CSS. A lot easier to understand than most other texts I've seen. Doesn't make you an expert at CSS, but builds a solid foundation.Great for those of us that has a short attention span.Be warned though, the text does assume basic familiarity with HTML. If you don't you might wanna blaze through the companion book, ""Teach yourself HTML in 10 minutes"" first as the text focuses on external CSS which should be learned after a basic treatise on HTML."
negative,Look's good ...... Didn't work: Item did not function and was of very poor quality. I went to Radio shack and purchased a much better one.
positive,"Works Fine: I plugged this unit in last night and to my amazement picked around 20 channels. I had to run to radioshack and switch the wimpy data cable it comes with. I bought an rg6 quad shielded cable , ideal for HD signals. After I swapped the cable the picture improved instantly. Add another $25 for the cable. I use the antenna in my house and I live 20 miles from the city center.I am using the RCA ATSC11 as my receiver."
positive,"Fun, suspenseful movie: This DVD is in fine condition and the movie is well done as well as exciting and fun to watch. My husband and I both enjoyed it despite our different tastes when it comes to movies."
negative,"3 decent songs, rest of it-blah: I like ""Touch"" best, ""This is the Night"" & ""Invisible"" are also pretty good, but I'm over ""Invisible"" by now. The rest of the CD just runs together for me. I get no feeling from Clay, although he has a good voice, he has little emotion and tends toward glory or held notes to impress. My least favorite of the 4 idol CDs I own, even Justin's gets played more often."
positive,"amazing: I Loved this book. Heart pounding romance and action, keep you going though the whole storie. I say this is a Must Read!"
negative,"NOT HAPPY WITH SCALE INNACCURATE: I'm a large guy, and I just weighed in at DOCTOR at 346, he said ""Lose weight."" I got this scale to track my weight, set it up and guess what in less that a week, I'm 306, that's 38 pounds off the doctors scale. UNless these people call me to correct this complaint, I got RIPPED OFF BY DETECTO. What it detects is INNACURASY.VERY UNHAPPY, DON'T BUY IT!"
negative,A perfect Bookend: The one line summary says it all. A perefct ornament. Reading it is a different story. Very poorly written or an incredibly poor translation. Can you imagine writing like this? Hooray to the run on sentences! Grade F
positive,"Regular dvd player: Easy enough to work dvd player. Had to fiddle around with the menu to set it to 1080p (does not start as default). Upconverting does improve signal slightly, but its not that amazing. It seems to depend on age of dvd its upconverting (ie old movies still don't get the crystal clear/sharp signals of new cgi type movies)"
positive,"Cute stuff!: They fit like a dream, they're comfortable to wear, and they look fantastic! Super-shiny silver pinstripes down a solid black twill fabric = divine! The only thing is that you have to dry-clean them, or wash them by hand and let them sit out to dry. Still, I love these pants. =D"
negative,"SPIC AND SPAN, CINCH, GLASS & MULTI-SURFACE CLEANER: REFILL 64 OZ: Spic and Span. Cinch. Glass & Multi-Surface Cleaner: Refill 64 OZ $5.85I ordered 5 of these since they were the ORIGINAL Clean Fresh Scent and the price was outstanding for a 64 oz refill. It is NOT what I received so I can't even give it a 1 star. The company, SOAP.COM, wrote me a letter stating I needed to get back with AMAZON.... that AMAZON was in the process of buying their company but the deal basically had not been sealed.So I received 5 32oz bottles of the NEW SPIC & SPAN and it does not have the CLEAN FRESH SCENTso this OFFER is BOGUS.I wrote the SOAP.COM who told me to get in touch with AMAZON.COM so I have no idea of the out come. BUT if you order this as listed you will NOT receive the 64 oz refill as listed.Susan PChesapeake, VA"
negative,"good sound but non-servicable: The sound quality is good. However, do your research. There is a design flaw in the headband whereby the plastic covering on the sides will crack after 2+ years of use. Turns out, after contacting bose, the headphones are neither factory nor user serviceable. You can exchange them in for a new pair at $100 cost. That's right, if anything breaks whatsoever, you are expected to buy a whole new pair. So instead of just stocking spare plastic headband parts for $2, bose wants you to pay $100 for another pair once these fall apart. I don't know about you, but for $300, I expected them to last a bit longer."
positive,"Very Essential: you can never have enough of the Elements to me.this is a Solid Collection of there Material in a double Disc Set.you have Earth,Wind&Fire in all there glory.there Original Line-up was no Joke they Ripped a stage up&back.strong Instrumentation,Arragements&the Vocals are on point.Maurice White Leads the Charge here with the Band&Brings so Much Life&a Feeling of Joy&Warmth on these Tracks.there Music is still a Strong Source for me."
negative,"Hostile nonsense: Written in the late Thirties, this book is a misguided attempt to interpret Robespierre as a precursor to Hitler and Stalin. It is a complete distortion of the aims and goals of the French revolution. Interested readers should pursue histories by Thompson, Hampson, Jordan and Rude instead to get a more accurate portrait of Robespierre"
positive,"Better than advertised: Received this ""used"" book, but looked as good as new. Thank you for the prompt service and excellent product.I will order again."
negative,"NOT WHAT IT SEEMS: This book is not what it seems. It is really just a re-telling of regional fairytells and fables and not a very well editted ones as that. I down loaded lots of these different ""color"" of fairy books . I scanned 2 or 3 and all were simular. Then I erased them all. You can see why they are free. Just a waste of space on my Kendal."
negative,"This is progress?: Apparently a replacement for the terrific 932c printer, this ""upgraded"" model is a bomb. Jams, can't print straight, picks up multiple sheets, and horrible service all add up to a misfire. I went through the hassle of getting two replacement units shipped to me, and both replacements had more problems than the original! I've written off my 940c. I don't think anyone should waste their time (and certainly not their money) on this one."
positive,amazing ...: Excellent Chicago blues that I expected to hear from Otis Rush and Al King as for the CD quality is kind of appropriate to recording style of 60's ... price wise is wonderful.
positive,western drama: This movie reminds me why the west was won ! I really enjoyed the drama and some of the funny sarcasim.
negative,"Not at all good: This book is filled with recipes using brand-name adulterated products that contain large amounts of additives, preservatives, artificial flavors, colors, trans-fats, bland flavors and also cost a lot more then scratch foods.If you believe boiling potatoes, using fresh vegetables or measuring flour unthinkable, by all means this book is right up your alley...."
negative,"Cell Phone Case: I was disappointed in this case. It is, to me, a thin, cheap case. I would not have bought it if I had seen and felt it before."
positive,Gladiator is awesome: I saw this movie in the theater. It was really well done. It isn't what you expect. There are quite a few of little twists. It is really excellent. Recommended viewing definitely.
positive,"great diapers, great service: This is the best diaper so far i have used. Not too thick like Huggies, no plastic feeling like Luv. wonderful."
positive,"One of my all-time favorites!: I could NOT put this book down!I have read it three times in total and plan to read it again. Betty Smith writes of the coming of age of one young girl in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn. Smith does well in characterizing Brooklyn and its inhabitants, from the ""fast"" but warmhearted woman to the lonely army boy.Smith accurately portrays the hopes and fears as well as the crushed dreams and ambitions of one young girl looking for happiness in a world full of nostaligia.A time that is past comes alive with glitter and grit in Smith's words."
positive,BEST BOOK EVER!!!: This is a must read! You don't even have to like historical. Excellent story. I have read this so many times my book fell apart and I went to buy hard cover.
negative,"Complete trash!: If you pick up this book expecting it to be anything like Lindenburg's FE study guides, you'll end up badly disappointed. The coverage is slapdash at best, and there are only two or three example problems per chapter--not nearly as thorough a practice as you need.What really tears it, though, is the practice exams included at the end of the book. I started working one of them a few days ago and gave up after the first ten problems. Not because I couldn't figure them out, but because the solutions were flat-out wrong. A sophomore ChE student could do a better job of solving these problems than the book did.The only place this book belongs is in the trash can--which just happens to be where my copy ended up earlier this week."
negative,"Very interesting subject, horribly written: I was really interested in reading this book, honestly. But it is so poorly written that I gave up after 30 pages or so. I don't care if it's important stuff, true or whatever. If the writer can't get the job done of explaining it he should leave it to somebody else. It seems he just poured his notes from his journal on the paper in a chronological order, with no overall plan.I give it a second star for the subject matter. If it was for the telling I'd want my money back."
positive,"GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!: If you really want a look at the primitive features of humans as a society, read it! It was a tale masterfully written but tragic at the same time."
negative,"not powerful enough: In a nutshell, not enough wattage to get the job done in a reasonable amount of time. I'd also appreciate a shorter cord. I love the idea of this device, the straightening element works well for me. My hair is coarse and very wavy, always frizzy unless I straighten, so I really wanted to like this product. My friend who has finer, thinner hair than mine loves it. However, the 700 watt power makes styling take forever. I may as well dry and then iron, since it would be faster. Still, I'll probably keep this for travel, since it's very portable."
positive,"Fun for the Family: A fun adaption for all of the family. I saw this film when it was first broadcast and it hooked me into the work of Tolkien, so that's a good thing. I love the scene with Bilbo and Gollum and I think this Gollum with his appearance and voice charaterization is the definitive Gollum. I wish Rankin Bass would have done all 4 books instead of just 1 and 4. Sure they are simplified, but they are far better than the aborted version of Lord of the Rings done by Bakshi."
negative,"Not the best diaper for boys.: I have two girls and a boy, when my daughters were in diapers I always used huggies, but when my son was born they did not keep him dry through the night so I switched to Pampers Baby Dry because that was the type of diaper that claimed to be best for boys, but it is not, my son leaks through all over his clothes and the person holding him and the diaper itself is nearly dry. It is as though the diaper can not absorb the pee fast enough. I would not recomend this product."
negative,"Do NOT buy this exceptionally lame tape set!: This series is very poor. The content is slow, and boring -- even for small children. But it is not only the content that is bad. The tape reproduction quality is totally unacceptable. Even the labels look like the tapes have been sitting in a trash heap in the sun 5-6 years. The sound quality is also so poor that several sounds cannot be distinguished. What is the point of a phonics tape when a child (or parent) cannot understand the sounds presented due to VERY poor sound quality?I live in Beijing and could buy 10th generation pirated tapes with better sound/picture quality one any streetcorner. I have emailed amazon.com to request they stop selling this trash as if it were a commercially produced tape series worth the price of shipping."
positive,"Never Cry Wolf: This narrative is a blend of humor, misconceptions, and at times ineptness as Mowat fumbles through misunderstond beliefs of wolf behavior, hunting practices, social hierarchies and parenting. Mowat is befriended by two Eskimos, one named Mike and the other Ootek. It is with his relationship with Ootek that helps Mowat understand the wolf. Through his conversations and with first hand observations Mowat is able to conclude, that the wolf is anything but a carnivore that kills indiscriminately. The wolf has a higher social order; has a distinctive language and is a caring parent. I would recommend this book, it is light reading, it is humorous, it expresses ones coming of age as a young biologist, thrusted into the wilds of the Canadian frontier, learns life's lessons of what is perceive is not necessarily true.The wolf is one with its environment and it is man that is the plague of mother nature."
positive,"I really enjoyed this video: I really enjoyed the kick to get fit workout. I found the video to be very enjoyable and very easy to follow along with. The instructor, Rich Grogan, shows you different levels for doing the movements, this has been very helpful, and is one of the reasons why I find this video fun to do. Another reason is the movements are very controlled and are done at a lot slower pace than most videos I've seen. I have found that by doing the movements slower and more controlled, my muscles seem to burn more. It makes me wonder why other videos go so fast! If you're looking for a really fun workout that is easy to do, I recommend kick to get fit."
positive,"GREAT!!! A MUST HAVE: GREAT STORY... LOVE IT, WHAT A GREAT MAN HE WAS!!! THIS IS A NICE MOVIE OF ONE OF OUR SAINTS!!!!"
positive,"A note: just wanted to say... HEY!!!! Guy/Girl from Dallas TX who wrought that 1 star review, I Read LOTR and it STUNK! Eragon is MUCH better!"
negative,"TMI (Too Much Information): My husband stopped reading after 50 pages. I preserved and after 100+ pages it smoothed out. When this book is good, it's not bad. When it's bad, it's horrid. TMI ..... She constantly drops the ""F"" bomb and I don't care to know so much about her or her friend's sex lives.As a fan of Julia Child, guess I expected more of the challenges of cooking Julia Childs' recipes as written. They're sort of an afterthought (maybe 2 or 3 paragraphs in a chapter) after the trials and tribulations of her life. The boredom of 9/11 ceremonies that as a government worker she is forced to witness, the boredom of her job, her dislike of Republicans, her boring fellow workers, etal."
positive,Good recipes: This cookbook contained several delicious recipes that were simple to prepare. Would be a good additionto a cookbook collection.
negative,"No big whup: After buying it as a gift for a retired judge and law professor, I took a gander. Frankly, it's nothing you probably didn't already know, as if the title doesn't say it all. What you didn't know hits on the same old bad media cliche, just older.My friend's response was that it was a mind dulling read. Might be a good choice for someone who wants to be immersed in the currently popular I hate the press pool, but I certainly didn't get the response I had expected from one of the best read men I know."
negative,"Amazon needs to sort out Weinstock and Huneker: This book is listed with Weinstock as the author, but Huneker is the author. Weinstock wrote the forward. He also wrote a book called ""Chopin: The Man And His Music"". Weinstock should not even be listed as a secondary author, much less the primary author."
positive,"the stunts steal the show!!!: I rmemeber first seeing vin diesel in pitch black a few years ago and i enojoyed it as well as fast & the furious and when i found out he was doing this movie i was really excited. THe movie starts off with xander cage(vin diesel) stealing a corvette and doing this crazy stunt off a bridge amd then gets a job working for the NSA by one of the operatives(samaul L jackson)and then it takes off from there, the movie is full of breathteaking stunts,as most of extreme sports feature breataking stunts and put them in an action movie and it really blows you away with a rush!. I think vin diesel is a great actor, he can act even though in this movie the actions spoke louder than words maybe simular to jean-claude van-damme or jet-li movie where you see not much acting but you have all these fancy martial arts and kicks and in this movie you see fancy stunts."
positive,Nothing special - just plain old drapery rings: they install in minutes and were easy to use. We ended up buying about 12 packs total for 4 windows.
positive,"Purchased for my Gram: This was a present for my grandma, she loves it, nuff said. Not my type of music, but hey as long as she is happy."
positive,"Simple to set up and use: I bought this unobtrusive little adapter at the same time as a bought my TiVo HD unit, both from Amazon. I plugged it in to my TiVo and followed the instructions the TiVo unit displayed on my HDTV. I typed in my wireless encription code and Voila! My TiVo was up and running on wireless in seconds!"
positive,Hilarious: I watched this movie at a friend's house early in the year; I didn't realize it was a comedy and I didn't realize how hilarious the film was. I have watched this movie over and over and still my cheeks are soar from laughing. I bought it for my sister as a birthday gift so now the both of us can watch it all the time. I highly recommend anyone renting this film but have no doubt you would want to own it.
positive,"My newphew loved it!!!: I bought this as a gift for my nephew and my brother called me when they got it. All I end up hearing was the yelling and screaming in excitement of my nephew as he played around in it, he loved it. Delivery was also earlier than expected which was a plus."
positive,"Street Index Fine Print: The street index is hard to read for the over forty crowd. If the font size was 12, it would have been much easier to read."
negative,The Heart is a Lonely Hunter: I find this book boring. I've had it for a month and can't bring myself to pick it up any more.
negative,"boxers: No I won't purchase Hanes Boxers again. I don't like the seams in them, and they ended up as clean up rags in the garage."
negative,"Not worth the money!!!: I've had my unit for a few weeks and have not been able to get more than 15-20 minutes of use from it until it needed to be recharged. Now it appears the battery will not take a charge or the charger is not charging. When I place the battery on the charger it blinks, which indicates it's charging. After hours of charging the light turns solid, which means the battery is fully charged. I place the battery on the glue gun and the low battery lights up and the gun will not heat at all. This product is useless. I went to WalMart and bought a $5 gun that works much better. Save your time and money and do not purchase this product."
negative,"Too sad!!!: I'm sorry, but my eyes were filled with tears through the entire movie!!! Sure, it's nice seeing the animals talk, but it's SOO 'darn' sad! It's just another depressing animal movie.If you love animals and want a good bawl, this movie's for you."
negative,"A redundant book of philosophy and vericose vains: While embarking on this ""classic,"" don't expect to find yourself absorbed in a magnificant tale. 1984 is a redundant novel with unnecessary tangents and pages of contradicting philosophy. ...and must we really keep reading in full detail the horror and disgust of Winston's vericose veins?!"
positive,"It can't get any more romantic than this!: To be so much in love, to try to get your loved one to fall in love with you again and again every single day... what more can I say? It's all told with Sandler's performance..."
negative,"meh!: A little frustrated with the seller on this one. I bought the book and realized I got the wrong one, okay, my fault, but then I tried to contact them to return it and they just ever so not subtly refused to contact me back. Tried a couple times. This book is not good at all. I have the first one, which is amazing, but this one is so not aesthetically appealing to me. The cover made me think it would be a bunch of artists like the first but in this one they are more computer based artist and artists who paint far more loosely. Maybe that would appeal to some, or a lot, I don't know, but for me my work is tighter and this book doesn't inspire me like the first one. Overall, though, seller sucks!"
positive,"Not too fancy, not too flimsy....juuuust right: I have started cooking more regularly and needed a good set of pots. I didnt want to pay for All Clad or Calphalon but I wanted quality stuff that would last a long time. The Farberware Classic series fit the bill. I started with the 13-piece set and have been so happy with it that I have added other pieces to my collection.The pieces are sturdy, they conduct heat well, and they are easy to clean. They are also simply designed and attractive, classic enough to fit in a variety of kitchens. Having this set of great cookware has made cooking so much easier and enjoyable that I actually cook more often. Great product!"
positive,Love these: I had looked all over Houston for these and could not find them. They are just what I wanted.
positive,"Future Sound Of London - 'Accelerator' (Cleopatra): Good electronic/ambient artist's very first CD,originally put out in 1991.Took me awhile to land a copy of this title.FSOL is strictly a duo,members are Garry Cobain and Brian Douglas.Really quite a piece of work here,that is IF you dig this genre.Tracks that I remember to my liking were ""Expander"",their inspiring single ""Papua New Guinea""(have seen this tune mentioned in magazine reviews and articles before),""1 To 8"" and ""Pulse State"".Should appeal to some fans of The Orb,Meat Beat Manifesto,Sky Lab and Chemical Brothers."
positive,The Definitive Guide to Statistical Deceit: This small volume contains a wealth of information that every member of our information-oriented society should understand. The best defense against being lied to is to understand exactly what has been said. Huff provides this information in plain English.
negative,"Julie Powell, I don't like you: I had such high hopes for this book and have been sorely disappointed. I've only read about half of it and am making myself finish it since I paid full price for it. Reading should not be a chore. There is so much wrong with it I can't cover it all but here are my major complaints:First of all Julie is downright obnoxious. There is nothing likeable about her. She is whiny, crass, and extremely vulgar. This book is also full of profanity. And I am appalled at her cold feelings towards 9-11 victims. I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed that. Second, this book has hardly anything to do with cooking. The author mentions the recipes almost as an afterthought. Third, she completely overwrites and I'm finding my mind wondering on nearly every single page. I am no psychic, but I am rather comfortable predicting that her newest book will be a complete and utter failure. I can see why Julia Child wanted no part in this."
negative,"Not the version of this book these reviews praise: Sadly, this is not the version of A Christmas Carol that these reviews praise. There are no illustrations, no note of unabridgement. However, the text is printed on good quality paper. I've often counted on reviews to help make a purchace decision, but this time I was mislead and disappointed. The story of course is a 5 star classic, and this version a fine read. It's just not the version the reviews indicate."
negative,"This book is a pastiche of other earlier books: It is hardly definitve in that, for two things, it doesn't even mention Hank Harrison and plays down Pig Pen McKernan's role in forming the band. Not mentioning Harrison (or bad rapping him) is ironic since the book cover emphaiszes, in large print, the words THE DEAD, which is, not coincidentaly, the title of Harrison's trilogy, Trager can hardly be thought of as a literary artist. I give it 2 stars for reference only."
positive,"Good relaxing music: I must admit I've mostly just listened to this CD while in the car and haven't analyzed the lyrics. The overall impression is of mellow, relaxing music with Neil's pleasant-sounding voice--that is, he's not sounding raunchy, nor screaming, etc., on this CD. Read other reviews for analysis of the lyrics, but if you want a good CD to mellow out with, this is a good pick."
positive,"Okay...that's it. U2 - we don't need you anymore.: This is a terrific disc. It is definately one of the seven albums to own from 1998...a highlight in a great year for CCM. With this record, U2 is officially expendable. Already Deliriou5? has released more spirit-filled records than U2 and they sound like U2 should sound like now -- which is to say, about the same way they did on The Joshua Tree. No seriously, the heart for God that Deliriou5? have comes out through this record and it is enjoyable and uplifting. Buy this record right after you get dc Talk - Supernatural, Kirk Franklin - Nu Nation Project, Dear Ephesus - The Absent Sounds of Me and Burlap to Cashmere - Anybody Out There and about the same time that you get Nicole Nordeman's"" Wide-eyed"". by the way, what is up with great christian european bands putting #'s in their names? Should we call them D5 for short? maybe some already do....ok, i'm done babbling now Tristram Coffin"
positive,"Good Fit & Function: The cover fits reasonably well, with only slight shifting. It does not obstruct any of the controls, display, the mouthpiece or the earpiece. I really like the clip on the back. I'm pretty satisfied overall."
positive,love him: Clay is truly the american idol and shouldn't have lost. This is worth your money for this fine mans TRIPLE PLATINUM ALBUM!! now Ruben cant beat that!
positive,"Fashionable Compression Stockings!: After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling."
negative,"Disappointed in the packaging: The book was wrapped with a thin bubble wrap and scotch tape, then covered with brown paper. The postman left it on the front porch in the rain and the book was ruined. I through it away."
negative,What No Ending???: The book itself is typically entertaining except for a horrendous glitch with the recording meaning that the last CD repeats the first few tracks ad nauseum and the book never ends. ARRRRGH. Basically it should be withdrawn from sale and rectified. Don't buy it!!!
positive,"Arrived quickly. Enjoyed tremendously.: Arrived quickly and enjoyed reading it, expect to see the movie."
positive,Vintage Warnes: A wonderful collection depicting Jennifer's unique talent from early on through her later years! It is a truly captivating and memorable musical journey with this Jennifer Warnes album. Extremely glad I made this purchase!
positive,"Great BUT hard to follow.: This is amazing, all predictions and foreshadows came true in our present day lives. Amazing story a must read."
positive,Very Suspensful!: This book always kept me reading. It was so good because they kept having many different adventures. So you never knew if they would die on this adventure or make it through to the next.This book also had to have a lot of time put in to it so I think that any one would like this book with all its adventures and magic.
negative,"McCartney Lovers Only: I buy/view/listen to a lot of music video's (read, sorry night life) and this one was a disappointment. Sound varies too widely act to act. Couple of goosebump moments (I love the Mega-Guitars on Kansas City) but mostly a smorgas-bored of available talent putting in their charity work. Zero additives for the video freak and no real explanation of charitable intentions ever given. Borrow this from someone instead."
negative,Where is it???: The Book did not come !!! I order it a long time ago and you took my money but you did not bring the book !
negative,"stay away from them: I received the item chipped and shorter than advertised. When I called the company I talked to Kristin that in a very short way told me that somebody would have emailed me with instructions. I called back on sept 16 2009 for the second time the same Kristin told me, kinda of rude ""I told you somebody will call you back"" . It's been 1 month today, I paid them, they sent me a wrong defective item and no sign of any response so far."
negative,"Please, No...: Courtney Massengale is a douchebag, Sam Damon is the hero. Got it all. In one sentence. Not about a thousand pages or so. Bleah. Damon also takes too much crap from Massengale, can't police his zipper and doesn't kick his cheatin' wife Tommy to the curb. Mind-numbingly dull and long for a saintly martyr of a hero who could be improved. If you're picking this off a professional development reading list, pick Starship Troopers instead (it's shorter, actually entertaining and more informative)."
negative,"Was She Guessing???: Has she stopped researching for these books? I have never returned a book in my life but this one went back to the store. Being Asatru I immediately opened up to the section on runes. That was a joke, they were completely messed up. She changed the names, swapped meanings for the runes, and even included the blank one. Runes are not something that one can debate on, they are what they are. The section of teenie bopper spells was memorable. Of course that kind of throws the three fold rule out the window. Or drives the witch performing them into a pickle, I would not want that backlash. This book was a waste of perfectly good paper."
positive,The Hobbit: Very good book!! If you have read the Lord of the Rings and you want to know more about Mr. Baggins life this the book
positive,Great Band Info: I was born in 67. So I have always enjoyed 70 s music but found alot of great music from the 60's about 5 years ago. I play guitar and that always gave me reasons to learn more.
positive,"confessions: Confessions was a thought provoking, thoughtful book. I like being surprised, and this one did surprise me. i highly recommend this book."
positive,Awesome: I used this to write my first screenplay and have continued to use it for every script I write. It is a way to jumpstart the creative process and then sprint to the finish line.
negative,"Terrible.: Well I'm not sure what Pampers has done but these baby dry diapers are awful. My son has been in Huggies for a long time and I thought we would give these a try since the price is a pretty good deal through Amazon. I'm sorry I did. These are VERY thin diapers and the quality is extremely poor. These are definitely not the baby dry diapers I used on my older son a few years ago. These are completely white, no design at all. They used to have cute Sesame Street designs on them. The sides are not very stretchy and the diaper easily gets pushed down by clothing. We have had leaking at night because of this. Also, when the diaper has been on for a while (like at night) it's like the diapers shreds a bit around the leg openings. I assume this is due to rubbing against clothing for extended periods of time. I will NOT be buying these again. I'm sorry I bought such a big box since most of these will go to waste. Pampers Cruisers however, are great."
negative,BLOODY NONSENSE= THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: I saw THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and I felt it was the most overated film I have ever seen. The plot could be concevied by a sixth-grader or less and the villians made me almost cry with shame on how lame they were. The rest of the cast acts like they went to the amatuer school of acting!!! SO all in all miss this film I wish I had!!!
positive,concise and great context: This book is really helpful in getting background information on all the books in the bible. I found it really straight to the point and accurate. I totally read my bible with it everyday.
positive,"good cd: this is a really good cd. i think that the song "" i think i'm paranoid "" is a funny song. and the rest of the cd is great"
negative,"absolutely dire: I bought this a couple of years ago as a mate was going on about them. Big mistake! There's only one really decent song on it - Chop Suey!, which is actually very good, but makes you wonder how a band capable of this is able to fill the rest of the CD with utter tripe.The lyrics to most of these songs are utterly dreadful, a child could write more meaningfully. They seem to be popular with the 10 to 15 age group, and really is you're older than that stay well clear.One star may seem harsh, but I really cannot bring myself to give it two stars, even though there is one song which impresses me. One good song on an album just isnt good enough; buy the Chop Suey single if there is one, and save some cash and disappointment."
positive,"Accurate and Consistent: First let me say that I've owned a number of highly rated step on scales that were all disappointingly inaccurate and inconsistent. This scale agrees with the one in my doctor's office, so seems to be accurate. If you get off to re-weigh yourself, it will give you the same result again. You won't gain or lose 3-5 pounds in a few seconds by getting off and on the scale, or by leaning a certain way or placing your feet in a certain spot, so it is consistent. It could be a little sturdier, but it's fine for home use. We've had it for at least a year or two with no problems. I give it 5 stars for home use."
negative,old and out of date: Was a good book in it's time but is out of date now.Don't waste your money. The up to date Black and Decker is probably great.
negative,"Gate Problems: Buy a different amplifier! I bought this because of the price and the output, but it has one feature that makes it so unbelievably annoying that I'm glad to be rid of it. It has a gate on it that is suppose to automatically switch between inputs. The way its suppose to work is if you have two inputs it will automatically switch to the one carrying the signal. Instead of working the way it should it automatically shuts off once the input level gets low, causing a clicking that cuts out the quietest parts of your music. During a fade in or out it just cuts out! If you're constantly using a high output device this might work for you, but anything less and this amp is no good."
positive,"Love the CD....... I play it over and over again!!: I absolutely love Clay's CD. I really like every song on the CD. When I got Kelly Clarkson's cd I skiped over a few songs. A few of the songs took some getting used to, but with Measure of a Man I wanted to listen to every song in it's entirety. It is so nice not to have to worry about the lyrics of the songs that my children listen to.They are 12 and 9 and they enjoy the cd as much as I do. It's about time someone has come out with some nice clean music that is in my opinion EXCELLENT!!"
positive,"Enya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya yack yack yack yack yack: Same old, same old. I'm an Enya fan, but the sound is just the same as awlways. It's a good album, but just like the rest. Does she ever just get bored doing the same old, or is she stuck in a duldrum/time warp?"
negative,"RE: Wipeout originally by Surfaris: Google the instrumental Wipeout , and you will read the real story. I love the Surfari's version which got to #2 on the Billboard charts in a matter of weeks."
negative,"Ps2 sims 2 duhhhh it's crap!: Ahhhhh.....creating families, having watched thier first birthday, awwww they're soooo cute!Cut the crap, thats the pc version.I opened that gift and i knew what it was when he brought it home! sims 2! sims 2! Christmas day comes ""Yayayay sims 2 for ps2!"" i put it in and huh? no kids?? It doesn't look the same as the pc one?? it's so much harder to control...so confused. I turn it off. Look it up on pc a few day later huh the graphics look different on this one thats because they are. i love the sims games but this is a poor attempt to try and make it different for people using ps2's. anyone agree??? i want 2 take it back! [...]"
negative,"Two Hacks: I don't know who is worse- Higgins or Macnee. The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next. Completely implausible. Macnee's narration is so overdone it is laughable. Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky. A real stinker. Wayne Schwartz, Los Angeles, CA"
positive,"Amazing: One of the best books I've ever read, highly recommended. The characters and plot are highly engrossing. Must read at some point in your life."
positive,"TheStreet.com Guide to Smart Investing: This is an excellent book for those who wish to become an informed and independent investor. Although I am a long time investor in both stocks and options, I found the material presented to be quite useful. Yes, much of what is presented is ""known"", but this book provides an extremely valuable outline for developing the discipline required to be a successful self directed investor.It is definetly not a ""how to get rich quick in the market"" book, but rather an orderly presentation of the skills you need to develop and useful techniques that will make you a successful investor. Must read for new but serious investors, very good review for the old hands."
positive,"a majority of one: I've loved this movie forever...watched my old VHS so much that it was beginning to look like a moth eaten rug!As 'Bertha' says [played by Rosiland Russell], ""It's like a Travel-log!""...a very interesting peek at the post-WWIIprocess of Japanese/American cultural assimilation as seen from the American perspective.Being a 'Trekkie' forever, too...see if you can 'spot' a young George Takei! And, Mr Takei reported in his marvelousAutobiography that Sir Alec Guinness had an awful Japanese 'accent'... to which I say = unless you're Japanese,you'll never know it....It's just great Guinness, great Russell, great Takei, other great character actors = a marvelous film!I decidid to 'treat' myself to a new movie...DVD this time...for many more years of enjoyment!"
negative,"Very boring and confusing.: I bought this book based on a firend's advice, who claimed that it was the best book he had ever read. Well, the first page was very interesting and captivating, and then I started suffering through the rest. A never ending, boring, slow, and confusing book. It took me almost a year to finish it and I suffred through every page. What is all the fuss? I didn't find it intelectually challenging, entertaining, or fun to raed. It was just boring and confusing, pure and simple."
negative,"big disappointment: After waiting months for this game to be released I find that its is essentially unplayable. Although I have a reasonably fast PC 3.06 Ghz and a fair video display, the game is slow and jerky and it crashes or hangs up constantly. Having played all the TR games this is by far the worst. I will be trying to get my money back on this one. If you haven't already bought it don't waste your time or your money."
positive,"Both excellent and important: Orwell's 1984 is the best reason for people to read. It demonstrates clearly and horrifically what can happen to an uneducated society that allows itself to be controlled due to it's own fear of initiative. Anyone who asks me why I read is automatically referred to this book, which is as important now as it was when it was written."
negative,"Shipping Costs are Ridiculous and Packaging Insane.: I contacted the seller to order the 2000 Tons I would need for my, er... project, and inquired about a shipping discount for larger quantities.Not only will the seller not offer any sort of bulk discount, they insist on shipping all orders at advertised unit size and in the pictured can!I'm going back to the Parking Lot Libyans. At least they won't up-charge you to repackage for bulk purchases; and THEY offer Free Delivery to any mall within 50 miles of your house."
negative,"Huh?: Will someone please, please tell me what the heck this man is talking about? This is the book for people who didn't find The Jaberwocky to have quite the necessary amount of pretentious pseudo-english garbage. Don't even bother trying to read this."
positive,tivo usb adapter: It has made my life a lot easier since giving up on those remote phone jacks for me tivo connections. Now I dont have to make a connection every 5-7 days or at all unless there has been a real power outage or router difficulty.what a joy
positive,Good vanilla flavor - a bit pricey though with the 'special' bags.: I think this is the best vanilla tea I have tried. I thought the tea bags made it pretty pricey - so I'll try the loose leaf next time.
positive,"A new old fantasy: A very good book with a lot of fun. It's a little slow at the start, but once things get moving, it become worth the wait. In fact, this was a book in which its ending justified its beginning. It's a fantasy story which reminds us that all fantasy stories do not have to be about Tolkien and such. Every review I see of this book likens it to Alice, Dorothy, and friends. While this book does touch on that type of fantasy, it also contains a contemporary view which gives it a flavor all its own -- a new old fantasy. Pick it up, read it. You won't soon forget it."
positive,"Agnes Grey: A good read - though modern readers might find it pious and simplistic, I found it quite charming and easy to read and engage with."
positive,Coin purse: Many years ago when I was stationed in Germany I came across a leather coin purse which allowed me to put all of my loose change in a compact pouch which was simpler than having coins constantly swishing around in my pockets. The coin purse is held closed by a spring mechanism which allows the pouch to be opened simply by squeezing it. It closes shut when you release the presure. This coin purse (pouch) is similar to the ones I previously owned. (They wear out after a few years use!) I purchased one for my adult son and two for me. They work fine and I am pleased with the quality and the price.
negative,"Very Disappointed.: I purchased the Beanpod Patchouli scented candle and I am very disappointed. It has been burning for hours and there is absolutely NO fragrance emanating from it at all. Also, it seems to be burning only in the middle. I have purchased these Beanpod candles years ago from a store and always loved them, especially the Patchouli scent. The store in our area stopped selling them, I found this on-line and made the purchase. I WILL NOT be buying another Beanpod candle again. I could have gone to a discount store for a crappy candle and spent a lot less money."
positive,"Great Everything: I cannot fault this transaction in any way.Prompt delivery, Good Quality, Good follow up.A pleasure to business with.We particularly liked the great detail the producers explained in how they achieved such realism in this EPIC production.This is a ONE of a KIND movie.They even show you how they did it!Amazing and true dedication to their art.Five Stars all the way."
positive,"Fantasic CD - Measure of a Pop Star: Love this CD. All the songs are great. My favorite song is ?When You Say You Love Me'. I listen to the CD over and over, especially that particular song. Clay has a great voice that I can listen to all day long. Hope he is around for a very long time."
positive,"One of my favorites: Great movie. Love the simple, clean humor. This has been one of my favorites since I was a kid. Definitely a must see movie!"
positive,"Worth the $?: Although the shoes were exactly what I wanted, I think the price is considerably high for canvas-topped shoes."
positive,"I Ordered This DVD For The Same Relative: This is another movie that I ordered for the same relative. They don't own a computer, so they aren't able to order those good movies that you can't find in a video, or department store. I'm sure they are enjoying this movie. They would have let me known if there was a problem."
positive,"This movie has it all: You know when you see some special effect or style choice in a movie or tv show or commercial that you like? Well, take all of those and put them in one movie and this is what Run Lola Run is - and they made it almost 10 years ago! If you haven't seen this, treat yourself and get it."
positive,"Dockers do the job.: This product was just what I was hoping for, and I had no problem with shipping. I highly recommend this product."
negative,"Krappy Handheld MK Game: First of all...let me say,that I am a HUGE MK fan,but oh my god...this game sucks! This is a TERRIBLE version of MK3.The fighters move VERY slowly and it is SOOOO HARD to pull off a single special move...let alone a fatality!!! The sound is terrible,the music is all muffled.Although the graphics are decent,this game is a komplete letdown.If you want a great MK game for the Game Boy,pass this piece of krap up and buy Mortal Kombat II instead.It's A WHOLE LOT BETTER!!!"
negative,"Great Book, Disgraceful Edition: This novel doesn't need my praise. But this edition needs censure. I have found over fifty typos and legitimate mistakes, the kind of thing you almost never see except in translations. ""Unconquerable"" is rendered ""conquerable,"" ""in"" becomes ""is"" (so you get things like ""All force is twain is one""). You can't read more than a few pages without being distracted.It's embarrassing that this edition slipped by even a single editor."
negative,"Not enough information. Cap did not fit my model.: The item was not fully described. I thought it would fit my Rebel camera,however it did not.Nor"
positive,"First recorded success for great Nero Wolfe: In their first recorded enterprise, the Big Bad Wolfe and his sidekick Archie Goodwin apply their wits and charms to unravel a strange case of announced death... Vintage Stout with some memorable scenes, Fer-de-lance deserves a special place on your bookshelf.This particular edition is quite good for a paperback, including as it does an introduction and some memorabilia from the private world of great Rex Stout. Definitely an excellent choice for the lover of classic mystery fiction."
negative,"Very poor story: The only good thing about this movie are the special effects. The story is poor, and even when it has great artists, they become secondary to the story. It is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and it is basically because of the lack of arguments behind the story.After choosing it, my girlfriend banned me for six months of choosing the movie to see togheter. (And I think I deserved it)"
positive,"Great! Only one minor detail...: Bought this kitchen for my 1.5 year old little girl. Already after the first day I can see that many more hours of fun will come from this toy! It didn't take my husband too long to put together, maybe 2ish hours. It seems very sturdy and I love the compact size. My only complaint is the size of the shelf in the oven and fridge. We bought my daughter the Melissa and Dough apple pie set to go with the kitchen, but the apple pie won't even fit on the oven shelf. My daugter got very frustrated by this! I just wish the self was a bit deeper!"
negative,"Do not expect this CD to rekindle your love of The Box Tops.: This CD does not come close to recapturing the spirit of The Box Tops in the 60's. Of the 14 songs on this CD, only two are worth listening to. Alex Chilton has lost the distinct tones that were prevelent in his voice in his youth. As you can tell, I was highly disappointed in this CD."
negative,"So-so observations - could have been so much better.: This book was rather disappointing. Crichton comes across as pompous. As I read it I felt insulted that he needed to overexplain every insight to his readers. He went on some interesting trips, but I couldn't help thinking someone else would have described the experiences much better."
positive,"Good Intro but not a comprehensive reference: This is a thin book. I am not sure it is worth $30. If you need a crash course Intro in RUP this book is great. However it does not go into great detail about any of the artifacts. You will need to buy the Ratioinal software, find a website with RUP templates, or buy another book that is more comprehensive if you are trying to implement RUP.It gives an overview of the different job functions and the artifacts those workers have to produce. Get this if you want an overview or RUP. If you want a step by step guide to follow, look on the web or get a more comprehensive book."
negative,"STOP!!!! Concider This Before You Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This was the most pathetic book ive ever read in my life!!!It was about a boy, his family, and a stump! Why would anyone in their right mind want to read a book about a stump? I'll admit that at the end I had hope that it might end up being some what decent, but the last chapter was all about the boy calling for shane to come back. The only thing that got it a star was the fact that it was the shortest summer reading book I had."
negative,"Good practice for speed reading: Not only does absolutely nothing happen in this book, but it is so poorly presented that you really don't want to spend too much time reading this. Skip the long paragraphs, skim through the vast majority of the dialogue, forget about the poem, and wait for book #6. Hopefully, the last book (#6 is supposedly the last) will buck the trend of the series going from good to bad as it progresses."
positive,"Best of the Dune Chronicles: ""Dune"" is a must-read for any sf fan at all. The giantsandworms are especially cool, and so is the fight betweenthe Fremen and the Sardaukar (the Emperor's speciallytrained elite fighting force). Unfortuanly, some of thesequels were pretty disappointing. The second and thirdbooks, ""Dune Messiah"" and ""Children Of Dune"" are defintelythe worst, and ""God Emperor of Dune"" isn't much better(although it does have its good moments), but ""Heretics ofDune"" and ""Chapterhouse: Dune"" are very good."
positive,"Not too little, not too much: I thought this book was great. It struck the right balance between being a comprehensive primer on the topic, having enough detail if you decide you need it and not going into too much detail about stuff that is dealt with elsewhere - like CGI programming or generating pages from languages like Perl. If you want that then buy Leraning Perl or CGI programming on the World Wide Web."
positive,"excellent, packed with useful info: Whether you're a beginner or an expert, you're sure to find dozens of useful tips and insights. It's also a pleasure to read. Literate, up to date, and user-friendly. Only one caveat: it was written when OS 8.5 was still in beta, so in those sections your mileage may vary."
positive,"Full contents, Good price!: I'm flyfisher in Korea. I think there is no necessity for talking about this book. Because this is so famous book to fishermans, as you know. Specially, this paperback edition is good for your wallet, with no omission. In a word, Full content, Good price!"
positive,"Timeless Classic!: Probably one of the most well written and complete stories I have ever read and I read daily. My meager words really cannot begin to describe what a wonderful story this is. If you haven't read it, you haven't lived!Yes its got a dragon in the story and treasure and elves and dwarves,etc. But it really is an enjoyable read. My 13 year old daughter read it and really like it and she doesn't like these kinds of stories.Do yourself a favor and read this book!"
positive,"What a great setup, I hooked it up under my bumper.: Whether I need to hook up my 7 pin round or my 4 pin flat, it is real easy now. I wired a 30a direct feed off of my battery to charge the trailer too."
positive,This is really great: This CD is a classic. It is a must have. This is the beginning of Bossa Nova in the US
negative,Horrible!: This movie is horrble. Basically the fact that it has nothing to do with Michael it has a bad plotline and bad acting. The only thing is good is it ended short.
positive,viewer in atlanta: Wow! What a fantastic production - it was a hit with my children and us parents. I highly recommend it.
positive,"Mortal Kombat: The movie that started a martial arts craze across America with a very good video game as well. Although obviously a remake of Enter the Dragon starring Bruce Lee, Mortal Kombat is more about pleasing teens than adults. Magic duels, psychic fights, and superhuman Karate are what Mortal Kombat is about. If you like this, try Invincible starring Billy Zane which can be found here at Amazon.com(I bought both here). Invincible is like this but more aimed at an older audience. If it gets you pumped(the opening theme song does!) and/or you simply like Karate movies, this is not the best but is far,far,far from the worst. Buy it if it is cheap but not if it costs over $10. Invincible? Now THAT is worth $10!"
positive,"Whistle Blower: Hard to find this Len Deighton Harry Palmer movie. I got excited when I saw it listed, I screw up and did not read far enough to see that it is for Regio 2 not Region1. So my error not the sellor, so I have not seen this missing jewel in my collection.It was packaged for safe delivery, arrived quickly from Europe. My ERROR Not Seller.Still looking for a region one copy??????"
negative,EVERLIGHT IS LITTLE LIGHT: LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIGHT FLASHLIGHTS.THE PARTY THAT SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH CHARGE DURING SHIPPINS IS A LITTLE SHAKING IN THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF OF SHAKING BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A GLIMMER OF LIGHT. AFTER THAT IF YOU DON'T CONTINUE TO SHAKE IT DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY.THIS LIGHT MAY POSSIBLY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE BUT THERE ARE OTHER LED FLASHLIGHTS WITH BATTERIES THAT ARE SUPERIOR TO THIS ONE. THE POWER USED BY THESE LEDS IS LOW AND THE BATTERIES LAST A LONG TIME.
negative,"cliche ridden, weak characters, simple plot, awful!: I was looking forward to an intelligently written novel What a disappointment this book was. I couldn't believe that anyone enjoyed this weakly written novel. It reqired no thought and in fact I was annoyed by all the cliches. The first rule of writting was ignored by this author.I can't finish his book because I am bored by his poor writing skills."
positive,"It will become a part of you...: Sweet Dream Baby is an amazing novel, and its power grows as time passes. I read the novel when it first came out, and it's still with me. The music, the sight of a swimming hole, even a dusty road can make Travis and Delia appear for me again. What I wanted to know when I put the book down was, does Travis have a chance at a decent life? And what was up with Delia? More and more, I want to find out, because I can't let these characters go. I hope there will be a sequel."
negative,"Probably for Little Little Kids Only: Maybe I didn't give the game a chance, but I couldn't because I would get motion sick too quickly. Maybe it's the very bright colors or the high-pitched music or the constantly going around in circles, but I was hanging over the side of my TV, turning green within 15 minutes every time I tried to play this. I was on the Baby Easy level, too, and I didn't find it all that easy, but I'm not a kid. No doubt it's probably a lot of fun later on when you get vehicles and stuff, but I couldn't even put together the snowman in the beginning levels. To its credit, the Baby Easy level does let you win even when your skills are horrible because I was a huge failure as far as navigating a river, and the game still applauded me and advanced me to the next level. (And still I couldn't put together the snowman. I am such a loser.)"
positive,LOVE IT!: I Love this book it describes things in such a simple and understanding way . It's not boring either . I love how it describes everything! Definitely a book to get to study for your ASVAB!
negative,"Well, it is a flashlight: I got one of these to power my cell phone, I have an LG VX-9800, a Treo 700WX and a Samsung a950 and you think with all the tips supplied that I would be able to use it with one of the phones but no. I tried to give it to my daughter and it didn't fit her phone either. I never found anyone with a phone it fit to give it to.I just use it as a wind up flashlight now. If anyone finds a source of compatible tips for other model phones that work with this, I would like to know."
negative,"Whatever happened to punctuation?: The author of this book clearly needs to go back to 9th grade English. This book came highly recommended, but I was unable to get past the first chapter as I was continually distracted by punctuation errors. Commas appeared in the oddest places, and did not appear in the places where they should have been. And am I the only person left who remembers the semi-colon?I understand the author is ""only seventeen"". I assumed his editor would be older and better educated. Perhaps I was wrong in this assumption."
positive,"True to the book: Unlike most movies (which usually seem to merely interpreate a book) the Dreamworks Narnia series follows the books word for word. That is the beauty of these videos they basically put pictures to the book. They special effects are dated but they don't distract from the beauty of the story.The ""Silver Chair"" is a wonderful movie. King Caspain (He was Prince Caspain in two earlier stories) has to find his son who has been kidnapped. Three adventurers try to find the prince and save Narnia. The story takes you ""deep"" into Narnia as you search for the missing prince."
negative,"PAL Region 2, Not for USA: If you're in the USA and using typical consumer equipment, you will not be able to play this since it's a european version of the film. Avoid the mistake I made and get the Region 1 NTSC version instead. The package says in fine print on the back ""this DVD is not to be exported, resupplied, or distributed by way of trade outside the EU..."" so I am not sure why this is listed on the US Amazon site to begin with. Item also arrived broken into pieces by USPS so I must just have terrible luck."
negative,"Offensive and cheap - Not appropriate for any children: I was looking forward to seeing a funny but fairly stupid movie. It was funny from time to time. Most of the good stuff was in the occasionally funny slapstick. But the main character was an unabashed [...] consumer, the main lady turned out to be someone of very poor judgement and obvious immorality, the main antagonist tried multiple times to artifically expand his male anatomy and then ended up totally fat in the end with a set of very female [...] and doing a dirty dance with them.The theme of this movie was, ""There are no consequences in life and the road to success is luck.""I was the really stupid one for not turning off this movie early on. I kept hoping it would end up well but I was very disappointed. I hope no one else falls into wasting time and money watching or supporting this offensive and waste of a movie."
positive,Well-made warm hat: This hat fits my big head well and keeps me warm. The inner lining is soft and not scratchy. I love it!
negative,Does not get hot enough: Amazon did a great job in getting the item out to me fast. Unfortunetly the item does not perform up to standards. It doesn't get hot enough to do a proper seal. It left bubbles all over the item. I tried it a couple of time by letting the machine warm up for up to 15 minutes and still did not get a proper seal.
negative,"the chronicles of cash cow narnia: Caspian lacks the heart and charm of Lion, Witch, Wardrobe. It felt stale, confusing and similar to the first film, full of dazzling critters rushing head first into another battle to save some ancient kingdom or whatever. It had been almost twenty-five years since I'd read Caspian, so I didn't remember the story. I had a hard time understanding the time frame relative to LWW. I wonder how they're going to gloss over The Horse and His Boy, that one sucked."
negative,"Gave up at 37 minutes into it: I borrowed from my library as I do many movies. I tried to watch it but I, too, did not find any amusement and I checked the display and had already watched 37 minutes of it without the hint of a laugh. Does this movie start out REALLY slow because it just wasn't funny to me at all. I consider myself to have a pretty good sense of humor and I laugh easily at funny, witty lines. The bit with the guy who was under the influence of some drug was to me, something only young immature boys would find amusing. I found myself watching this like it was an assignment that I had to complete and I finally just stopped the DVD and gave up.Not my ""cup of tea"", I guess."
negative,"OMG, it's bad.: Wow. A movie about age difference in a relationships. Wow. What an earth-shattering idea! wow. Add a punch of bored actor and clumsy acting and have one wow of a mediocre movie. I don't know what bothers me more: Hollywood's inability to make great movies, or the publics' insatiable appetite for movies that they will watch craps and don't know it."
positive,"Lauryn Hill dazzles with her soulful voice: Lauryn Hill receives 5 stars for her new CD. The lyrics are really fantastic and reflect many thoughts and opinions of young adults in modern life. She is right on in her song ""Doo Wop (That Thing)."" I love her deep, soulful voice, it really touches a chord in my heart. This CD is perfect- the lyrics, the beat, and most of all, Lauryn Hill."
positive,"An Overlooked Classic: There's no doubt that ""Till We Have Faces"" is Lewis' most profound book. Its prose is masterful: spare, stark, the best writing Lewis ever did. He creates memorable, fully human characters, especially in Orual, daughter of Trom King of Glome. She is ugly, brutalized by her father, friendless until love enters her life through two characters: her Greek slave tutor and her youngest sister, Psyche. The novel becomes an examination of loves true and false, of manipulation of love, and of the power of grace to redeem and love the unloved and unlovely. I've read this novel at least a dozen times; it never grows stale. You needn't know the original myth to enjoy the book. I only wish more readers knew about this book--even many Lewis fans are unaware of this one. It will move your heart and make you think."
positive,Something for everyone: This enchanting movie is one you will watch until you wear the tape out. What I really love is that along with the clever humor and magical effects it delivers a compelling example of love making stronger family ties than common genes. Don't rewind until the credits are done...the outakes are a scream!
negative,Stick with the Mach III: Do not buy this product. I found that I got more nicks and cuts from using it. My skin would hurt from the extra friction. Stick with the MACH III. The MACH III does a great job. The Gillette Fusion is not worth the price. I used it for about a month - Now I'm back to the MACH III.
positive,It was the best Night World book!: Compared to all the night world books this one is the best! I love how Rasheal is so brave and finds her soulmate while fighting vampires.
negative,Not good: I was disappointed in this book--too European for my taste. I expected more from her. I'll give it to Goodwill or such.
positive,"great bargain if your power needs are modest: My need was to drive extra speakers satellite in two different rooms. It works fine for that purpose but barely. Driving 2 pair of 8"" 8 ohm ceiling speakers"" wired in parallel with impedance matching volume controls takes about all this amp can put out. Sounds fine and works ok but volume control is set close to max. Frustrating that it shuts down if signal level drops (between selections, etc) but instructions give the work around to prevent it. For the price it is a real bargain but if you need some power think about the next level up."
positive,"Remember that cookie that you made long ago...: Remember that cookie you made long ago... but you just can't remember where you got the recipe? Most likely you got it from this book.I had this book while growing up. My mom and I made countless cookies from this book. One of them called for a box of cake mix (which was one of my favorite to make). Years later the book disappear and thought to be lost forever. I could never remember where I got that cookie recipe from.. 'til we found this book amongst my brothers books! There was my recipe: Butter Mix Press Cookies! amongst all the other family favorites: Snickerdoodles, Chocolate Crinkles, Bonbons, and more!After getting this book you will never need another cooky/cookie book again!!"
positive,We love Todd Parr!: We are big fans of Todd Parr's work. We give his books as gifts as much as possible. Great positive and simple life messages in all his books.
positive,"An almost-excellent action film...: ""Mission: Impossible"" is a nearly perfect film. If it weren't so darn confusing at times, it would be an absolutely wonderful movie. However, it boggles itself down with too much dialogue and confusing plot twists. But it's no doubt a highly-enjoyable movie. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt, a secret agent who has been betrayed and now must prove his innocence. This is the most of the plot of which we know for sure. The other details are too complicated to really understand, but they don't matter. What matters is the constantly suspenseful moments including the beginning where Hunt and team are chasing after a bad guy to the heist Hunt makes in the CIA building to the incredible helicopter-chasing-the-train sequence that makes up the film's climax. There's much to enjoy in this movie and, if you watch it a few times, it even begins to make sense. I highly recommend it to any action fan who doesn't mind thinking every now and then. It's a superb action flick."
negative,"Got Carried Away with Special Effects: I thought this movie was really cheesy. It got so carried away with the special effects, that there wasn't enough room for a real story. This new version of ""The Haunting"" was terrible, and it could have been a whole lot better. I don't reccomend this film to anyone who has seen the original, they would be very dissapointed and frustrated."
negative,"plagiarism...you say tomato...: Okay, so Christopher Paolini turned his thesaurus upside down and shook out a few different words, but, for all of his rearranging, he couldn't cover the fact that this book is completely unoriginal. Intellectual property by any other name...Those searching for a cliche can find solace in ""This book is a cure for insomnia"".It's been said that when a new book is published, read an old one. If you have read only the major works of fantasy, read or seen ""Lord Of The Rings"", or have even a vague remembrance of the plotline of the ""Star Wars"" movies, then take heart, for you can say with all honesty that you have read ""Eragon"".It's no excuse that the author is just 19. He can be tried as an adult, you know."
positive,"Wow, what a film!: I can't begin to describe how this movie got to me. I've been an Antonio Banderas fan for years, and he just struck something deep within me with his role as Nestor Castillo. His love for Maria destroyed his life, and that made me cry ( I NEVER cry at movies). It was hard not to love him with those doe eyes of his. You must see this movie."
positive,"Very good book!: This book was breath taking. Trisha did an outstanding job in writing this story. I enjoyed reading this book. Although I read this book 3 months ago, I still can remember how everything took place in the end. I recommend this book to all my friends, loved ones, and family members. It is definitely something to keep on the shelf."
positive,"excellant extra features: The DVD was very good with lots of extra special features that added to the story line. Lots of newer interviews. The section on the composers of the various movies was good. Sine Goblet is my favorite of the series, it was a worthwhile investment."
negative,"A PIECE OF JUNK!: Do not buy this toy - it has been a source of frustration and disappointment for all 3 of my children. Difficult to put together (and I have assembled my share of kid's toys), it will not stay together at all. It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design. The noises are also weak as are the features (i.e. the trip wire, rockets, the plane). Just a complete waste of money - it is only a couple of weeks old, and it is headed to the trash."
negative,"Reads like a 10 hour Nightly Newscast: Tom Brokaw (and a squadron of 'helpers') produced a bombastic, windy book that is a disservice to the superb stories that he is trying to tell.The book is at its best when Brokaw lets the individuals tell their own stories, with a minimum of his commentary intruding. The peoples' stories are poignant, vivid, and worth reading.The problem is, you have to wade through Brokaw's creaking prose to get to the good stuff. Hackneyed phrases loaded with superfluous adjectives may sound OK when read in Tom's distinctive voice - but they do not read well.So - kudos to Tom on getting people to tell the stories. Rotten job of trying to package them."
negative,/???????????????: Don't buy..........This is a spin off from another book but not worth the $$ to get!!
negative,"Beauty and the beast: ""Beauty and the beast"" by a director that wants to be David Lynch. Human beings don't act like human beings. It's all about a sense of weirdness, and any resemblance to the historical Diane Arbus is entirely coincidental. And that's a pity because her life was interesting"
negative,"Too much of nothing: The first three books in the Earth's Children books was very well written and I really enjoyed them. Book four "" The Plains of Passage"" was too descriptive with not enough story. Also, it had too many detailed love scenes. Book five ""The Shelters of Stone"" started out a little better but then went back to being descriptive. I am completing the set of books but I have read much better books and I do not recommend them to anyone.Amazon Verified Purchase"
positive,"Great Read: Anyone who thinks that becoming addicted to Valium can't happen to them should read this book. Brutally honest it follows Barbara Gordon, a successful award winning documentary film maker, through her addiction to Valium and her painful struggle to get off. This is a great read. I won this from Goodreads."
negative,"Not worth the paper it's written on....highly disappointing.: As an avid blogger and foodie, I looked forward to buying this book for over a year. Now that I have it, I can't even finish reading it. Powell is not only a bad cook but a bad writer as well.This book doesn't stick with any audience. Bloggers think it's overrated. Foodies think it's insulting to Julia Child. Readers feel it's a bad piece of writing. Overall, it's just bad. On top of everything else, her constant b*tching about her botched recipes got on my last nerve.Boring and not really about anything, this book is as bland as an unseasoned chicken breast."
positive,"Boots: I have an old pair and they are great in the winter and comfortable. SoooooI ordered a second pair for this winter and by the looks at the snow fall yesterday, it was a good choice."
negative,Nobel Prize?: So if the Nobel Prize is for the author's body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that's in capital letters). If this is his best work and most famous work and it is a labor to read then his other works must be capital punishment!!!Much like the best book of the century by James Joyce - Ulysses.Again another book to be placed in Solitary Confinement!!!
positive,"Nice Rack!: This is truly a fantastic bike rack.I have an Infiniti FX 35, which technically cannot accept a rack of this type. However, after reading through some online Infiniti forums I decided to give it a try.The rack was simple to assemble and mount, looks great, and holds our two Cannondale Quick 6 bicycles perfectly. It feels very stable and the bikes come on and off in seconds.Most importantly, I am not what one would call mechanically gifted, yet find it so simple to install and breakdown this rack. On the first try it took about fifteen minutes; now it literally takes under two minutes for installation and removal. It is also very stylish looking. Highly recommended!"
negative,"Can't Believe This Was Even Published: Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book""."
negative,"are you kidding me?: I have 2 boys and several nephews. I know about and buy a lot of toys for boys. This is by far the biggest piece of junk that I have come across in a long time. The graphics- very poor. The overall ease of use and entertainment value- also very poor. This reminds me of the ""electronic"" happy meal games. I bought two PETs and both were defective and had to be returned to the store. The PET launches into battle mode via a motion sensor which is activated when you shake the PET. Both units I bought had defective motion sensors, no amount or variation of shaking would consistently launch battle mode. Also one unit had defective graphics, showing just black jiggling specks. Most of the reviews on this product are by eager boys who WANT a PET but don't have one yet and they are giving it high ratings. Trust me boys (and parents), this is not worth $30. As I said, a sonic game from a happy meal will be more satisfying and functional than this."
positive,tv series ncis third searon: NCIS Naval Criminal Investigative Service - The Complete Third SeasonVery good quality. Fast shipping.
negative,"Good only for the first few days: So i purchased these weights a few days ago and they appeared very comfortable. But after a few days, the cloth started to expand and then sand started to seep through. This product was only good for teh first few days of purchase."
positive,FOUND NORA BY ACCIDENT: It was the 21 of December and I was busy into baking and wrapping but wanted something wonderful to watch on TV while I was buzzing around my house. On the Sundance Channel I found NORA and ended up sitting down and watching the entire movie...it was spellbinding. I did not know much about Joyce before this movie but it certainly makes you want to search for info on his life...Pat Murphy directing was flawless and the actors so suited to the roles. The photography was incredible. Wonderful movie - make sure you watch it.
positive,"Solid: So far so good. Very solid feeling pot, as one would expect. Seems good for the price, comparing it to other similar pots here on Amazon. So far, it has performed well."
negative,"very bad book: The book is very poorly written. It doesn't have enough solid complete examples to cover a topic. The author tries to rush through and cut corners at every place. The author doesn't realize that theory is best when it is coupled with complete examples. Even the CD is poorly organized and doesn't flow with the book. I'd give this a -1 star if I could.I think the book ""core java 2"" is much better."
negative,"Don't waste your time with this garbage: I seriously suspect that people who gave 5 star reviews for this book work for the author or publisher. This book is nothing but a plug for his real estate courses. Believe me, buying this book will make the author, LeGrand, millionare not you."
positive,"A fascinating, disturbing, and insightful read!!!: this is most definetely the best book i have been required to read in high school. ""lord of the flies"" symbolizes the evil within everyone of us and survival with no rules. this novel is defenitely worth reading- but not for children. this book hints at a different form of reality- where there are no rules, no compassion...only survival. it will make you doubt yourself and help you to see things differently. it's a very enlightening and insightful book, and i loved it!"
positive,three's company: I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD since DVDS came out. This is my favorite show. You must buy this TV show this is the best ever. I have been watching this show since i was little. I just love John Ritter shows and movies he is so funny. I'm going to miss him. Rest in peace John.
positive,"Bergman at her best: Ingrid Bergman received a Best Actress award from the Academy for her performance in the 1944 version of Gaslight. As anyone knows, the Oscars are not necessarily a good guide to fine acting but, in this case, she deserved it in spades. This taut, suspenseful production, superbly directed by the great George Cukor, also features fine performances from Charles Boyer, Angela Lansbury (17, going on 18) and Joseph Cotten. But it is Bergman's performance which elevates this film out of the ruck, so that it takes its place among the best of its type. The DVD transfer, on the whole, is good, although the print from which it was made shows considerable signs of wear in the first 10 minutes, and the whole thing could do with a restoration/clean. The special feature, hosted by Bergman's daughter, Pia Lindstrom, is well worthwhile - and on the flipside of the disc there is also the 1940 British version of the Patrick Hamilton play. A DVD worth owning."
negative,"Horrible book: This was the worst book I've ever read. Most of the book was just saying the exact same thing a million different ways. It was an interesting idea behind the book, but it was altogether boring the way it was written."
negative,"Abysmal, a waste of time: For its tedious pacing, this butchered H.P. Lovecraft story might have been watchable if the actors could act or speak."
positive,"Perfect for me!: This is the perfect coffee brewer for me. I was so excited when single cup brewers started showing up on the market, but I had no idea which one to purchase. I don't like drinking stale coffee or reheating coffee and the mini 4-cup brewers don't make that great a pot of coffee. Going to the coffee stores is a VERY expensive cup of coffee even if it is quite good. I tried a cup of coffee from this brewer in a high end kitchen store and it was a great cup. Plus with all the drink options (reg, decaf, tea, hot choco), I was sold. I bought from Amazon on a special purchase deal and got the My K-Cup for free.I love this brewer. I get one perfect fresh, hot cup of tea, coffee, or cocoa every time. There is very little waiting and no filters or pots to mess with. The different cup sizes, the timer, the style are all great features."
positive,"recommend this title to the r&b classics of the century: r.kelly has done his best on this album.. the inspiration probably came from sex. from the intro to the last song, this music is tight. espcially all the slow jams are just the right songs to get into the sex mood with your man/woman."
positive,"good funky album. listenable all the way through.: I recommend this album. Its funky, different, soulful. For me, a good break from all the crappy hiphop that comes out these days. Much thanks to the twins!"
positive,"Great well-rounded text: I stumbled on this text while trying to understand nested design for analysis of variance. Better than any other text I used, this book helped me to understand the calculation steps as well as the underlying theory. (All the other texts I used had holes in their explanation.) This has become my favorite statistics reference."
positive,"The Zenith of Asimov!: I highly recommend the time to read ""Foundation""...it just may convince you to continue on with the rest of the series. I believe it was the forerunner and main idea behind the concept of a galactic empire as has been expanded on by Star Wars and Star Trek. If you would like to see the genesis of the idea behind those phenomena then you'll very much be rewarded by reading the Foundation series...besides, anything by Asimov is worth its weight in gold and this is the zenith of his space operatic writings!"
negative,"An awful, awful book: This is probably the worst book I have ever read. It left me lukewarm towards the characters, not really caring whether they lived or died. The plot was slow and predictable, with parts taken almost directly from other popular pieces of liturature. The writing was atrocious. I could not even finish this book, that's how bad it was. I can not imagine why anyone would like this. Sorely disapointed."
positive,"Another Good Piece of Work from a Great Band: An all around good album good album with a good sound, but the disappointment is - is that only the first hlaf of the album is GREAT. The second half is good, but usually after ""Push It"", I hurrily change to the last song before I turn it off. ""Medication"" and ""Hammering in my Head"" are the best songs on the album, but the whole thing is well - worth listenin' too. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed - especially if you're a garbage fan."
negative,"Yes, Read the whole thing!: I don't see how you can isolate ""The Grand Inquisitor"" chapter from the novel in which it is situated, The Brothers Karamazov. I think that knowing who is telling the story, who he is telling the story too, what the story means to each of these people, and what the consequences of what the Grand Inquisitor have to say, are ALL important; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor!!!!!!! My suggestion: Buy The Brothers Karamazov instead of this. It's excellent."
negative,"Misdirected Talent: I'm afraid I'll have to agree with the reader from Grants Pass, OR, who wrote in her/his review, ""life is too short and the world is too full of good reads to spend time with this one."" I want a book that lifts me up rather than brings me down. For others who feel like I do, I recommend another book I got from Amazon, ""People of Passion"" by Carl Mays. It is also about people from the South (Appalachia) who had it bad, but they found meaning and purpose in life and had the faith and determination to rise above their circumstances. There is no doubt that Carson McCullers is a talent, it's just that I was depressed by the way she used it with the characters and their decisions in their situations. Unlike, some of the reviewers, I did finish the book, but not with pleasure or satisfaction."
positive,"Eragon RULZ!!!!: I love this book! Christopher Paolini did an amazing job! It is full of adveture and fantasy both things that I love! I'm 11 and I think that this book is pretty much for kids ages 10 and up because it is scary at times. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE coming out on December 15!!!!!!!!! HOORAY FOR ERAGON!!!! I also loved the book ""Eldest"". I hope for more books in the ""Inheritance"" series."
negative,"Book of Dream By Sylvia Brown: I ordered three of her books How to contact you Spirit Guide, Life on the Other Side and her book of dreams. The first two were terrific, but the book of dreams is difficult to understand. However, I'm trying to understand. Sylvia is a great Author, who can keep you captivated. I would really like to meet her and learn more about her.M.G.Ebner"
negative,"I know it's a classic but...: I am a Dickens fan but 'A Christmas Carol' isn't my cup of tea...it's dark and sermonising, not what I really want at Christmas time :)"
positive,"A Great Tragedy: Othello is now one of my favorite Shakesperean plays, right behind Romeo and Juliet. The play contains many universal themes which could be applied to life today, such as jealousy and revenge. The book is sad at the end, but it is very well-written and is effective in evoking emotions in the reader. I recommend this book for anyone who has to read a Shakesperean play or for anyone who wants to read a good book."
negative,"Only half the head rotates: I was thrilled to see what a bargain these replacement heads were compared to the store. I ended up throwing them out and going to the store. Don't waste your money. The top part of the head rotates, but the bottom half does nothing. The ""real"" ones, both parts of the head rotate. I don't know why this even says CREST on it."
positive,"Life with Father (by Clarence Day): I loved this book as a preteen and I loved it, and the sequel ""Life with Mother"" too. Mr. Day paints an accurate picture of life in the early 1900's for a middle class family. Yes, his father is rude and a bit obnoxious, but watching him is very funny. He loved his wife and family and while he blustered and yelled, they loved him. I enjoyed this book and thought it was great."
negative,"Why are they doing a special edition?: Why in the world are they releasing a special edition of ""The Claws of Axos?"" This is one of the worst Jon Pertwee stories ever made! Terrible plot, appalling acting from most of the guest stars, oddly phallic monsters, and the last few minutes of the plot, including the last action scene, are ridiculous! I scratch my head at the wisdom of a special edition of this one. It's one that this die hard Doctor Who fan will skip."
negative,The Mail Ate It...: I know these razors work great but they just never came. Got my refund though nice and easy. Seller wasn't sure what happened either. Guess the mail ate it or something.
positive,"this story is interesting and good.: This story is very interesting and good.It talks about alot of different things, like sorrows, mishaps, love, etc.I especcially like Jo."
negative,"The title of it being ""Christian"" is a Misnomer: While there are many good entries, I was disappointed to see several pages relating to Malcolm X, obviously not a Christian and only name recognition for Pastor Tony Evans. The Winan Family was not mentioned although a comment made by CeCe regarding Andrea Crouch was included. Also absent in length are Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver and Ben Carson all Christians who have contributed greatly. I actually considered purchasing this as a resource for our home education. I borrowed it from the library first to review it. I think I will return it and leave it there and perhaps borrow it again if there are no other resource available."
negative,"Like Eating an Entire Box of Chocolates: ...too much of a good thing. As much as I loved each of the Mitford books, and as much as I wanted to love this one, I just couldn't. I think maybe Jan Karon overreached. Instead of sticking to Mitford as one might expect in the series closer, Father Tim and Cynthia go off to a new/old church that happens to be just close enough to Mitford for the old characters we've grown so familiar with to pop up regularly. She introduced a score of new characters to go with the new church, and it all became too much to keep straight and, quite frankly, too much to swallow. Too many country-isms, too many perfect endings, too many...you name it. It was just overstuffed. And for all that, there were too many things left unfinished! What happened to Miss Rose, for instance? Did Father Tim and Cynthia make it to Ireland? Did Dooley and Lace marry?I would much rather have ended in Mitford."
negative,"Ordered new, but received poorly refurbished.: The calipers I ordered were supposed to be new and unused. The item I received was nicked, scratched, and even slightly bent. The whole unit was dirty and did not slide smoothly. It appeared as though a used unit was refurbished (poorly) and repackaged before it was sold. I am very disappointed with this item and would not recommend it to other people."
positive,"Simply delivers: When buying K&N; filters, you cannot go wrong. Add the excellent Amazon's prices, fast delivery and you get an unbeatable deal.Very happy with the purchase."
positive,"Excellent Reading - a Unique and Fun Mystery: This book was recommended to me by an Amazon.com email. I took a chance, and I'm very glad I did. EXCELLENT READ! I had fun with this book, enjoyed the cast of characters, enjoyed the story. I like the writer's style - the author kept a lot of characters going in this book and didn't lose my interest. I liked the main character Ester. She got involved, and she helped solve the mystery and fight the good fight. The names of the characters might throw you - the names are ""theatrical"" (like Golly Gee, Darling Delilah), but since the characters are mostly actors or performers, this can be forgiven. I can usually figure out ""who done it"" in mystery books. However, I thought the author did an excellent job with the mystery elements in this book. Overall, a fun and entertaining read. I look forward to the next book in this new series."
positive,"Fun but feels like an outline: While I couldn't put it down - I feel like I just finished a LONG outline. Great concepts throughout, makes me want to get out the telescope and look at the moon again and say ""what if"".Weber's style reminds me of WEB Griffin or Beowulf - each chapter peeking in on an hour in the action, spread over months or years, villains or heros dispatched with alacrity and gore. This could have been a framework for a whole series of books in the hands of another author, perhaps delving deeper into the characters and the worlds. But I certainly appreciate the classic scifi visions."
positive,"New coffee table book!: I keep my copy next to my tv-guide, that way I can look for the nit picks! Actually it is a good book, but it does tend to distract you from the episode."
negative,"SONY Installs the most insideous TROJAN HORSE: I love Santana, but I am not buying this CD because it installs the most insideous form of virus/trojan-horse called a root kit onto your PC if you rip/play it there. The rootkit isn't even well written at that, so it is even more dangerous to your pc.Also, There is NO WAY TO REMOVE IT without completely reinstalling your Windows Operating system!Don't get me wrong. I use Yahoo/musicmatch/napster and am comfortable with their Digital Rights Management.Tell SONY you won't stand for this and do not buy this CD"
negative,"You get what you pay for: Be careful if you purchase this product. The price is decent, but you have to keep it moving or it could cause damage to flooring. I luckily read about this issue from a reviewer who damaged the floor when letting the vacuum sit on unprotecting flooring while using the accessories. I vacuumed new but inexpensive carpeting with it and the amount of carpet fibers in the container blew my mind. Even at the highest setting. It is pretty heavy, and if you leave it sit for more than 10-15 seconds on a single spot it could cause damage. Use the highest setting on carpeting and keep it moving."
negative,"Great while it lasted !!: We purchased this unit for Christmas of 2002. In July 2003 the player quit entirely...disc would spin but the screen was flat gray. No picture. Called Audiovox, they had no idea what the problem was and said to ship it back. Spent $10 to return via ups. They could not repair so sent a replacement. The 2nd one worked until January of 2004, then quit also. This time I was told that because the 1 year warranty had expired (from the date of purchase-not the date of replacement) I was out of luck. I could send it back for repairs at my expense. Fortunately I had the foresight to have purchased it on American Express which automatically doubles a warranty up to one year. Amex is going to refund my money so that I can purchase a new unit. The next one will definitely NOT BE AN AUDIOVOX!!"
positive,"The Descent.: A Bunch of Women who want to be Men well not all of them, go into a Cave(no pun intended) and meet some interesting Things on the way down(That's what she said), and so these ""Things"" Or Creatures apparently have it out for them, Short and Silly review but hey it is what is,I did like the Movie and I certainly Enjoyed it More than The Descent 2."
negative,"i am still in a hole: this game, sorry this item is not unfinished but it shouldn't even be in the market. Not only was it impossible to complete, it made me gag every time i hear the E.T. theme song. This game should be extreme punishment for kids to suffer if they misbehave or break something valuable. Please save your green dollars and go buy Call of Duty Black Ops II or Halo 4. Definetly the worst thing to be called a video game before Superman 64."
positive,Packed full of Info/pictures/stories: I bought this book as a gift to my brother who is heavy into comics and graphic arts. He started reading it right away and could not put it down. I Thought he knew most of the characters but I guess not. Any comic book fan should get this.
positive,"Dinah Washington's Hit Albums: Back in the 80s I owned the vinyl albums and the cassettes of Dinah's hits. Over time and many moves, I lost track of them. I am very happy to have them back in disk form!"
positive,Glad for e book: Glad to have had an on line dictionary available as there are plenty of archaic and/or rarely used words. A true classic...and the on line price was too good to pass on.
negative,"I wonder if Ayala could walk on water....: ....because she could do everything else.I have read all of Auel's Earth's Children series and I have to say that is book was a disappointment.First off, the characters are all one-dimensional, boring and predictable. We all know that Ayala can do, say or wear anything and it'll turn out to be ""right"". Jondalar is such a wuss, lol. I mean, does he ever disagree with Ayala or get over his insecurities of every man desiring ""Ms. Perfect""?Another thing are the explicit sex pages. Ok, how many times to we have to know when Jondalar is going down on her? Yes, yes...feels great; I love it too but there are so many times you can read about it before you start turning pages 3 at a time to skip over the taudry and tedious 3rd rate, quasi-porn.All and all this book was NOT her best. I'm really wondering if Ayala will ever see her son, Durc again. Maybe Jean should concentrate on giving the readers what they want! THat loose end needs to be tied!"
positive,Classic Batman adventure: Classic Batman adventure that delivers with style. Now we can watch the Dark Knight next. We enjoyed it even when we were home sick.Good Job!
positive,"Basement Jaxx - Red Alert: As the first single off the Remedy album, ""Red Alert"" is an enormously fun track -- the lyrics, the chorus, the funky bass, the vocal squeal of pleasure all come together quite nicely. The Jaxx Nitedub makes the track less happy-go-lucky by stripping out the vocals except for a few select screams, while Erick Morillo & Harry Romero Dub goes a slightly cheesier route. Steve Gurley adds some broken beats to the mix with interesting results. The B-side, ""Razocaine,"" is a darker piece of work, all distorted bass, filtered horns, and modulated vocals, a nice counterpoint to the upbeat ""Red Alert."""
negative,"This book needs to be edited for kindle: This book wasn't really what I was looking for. I thought I could use it as a reference book, there is a nice index in the back that I would have liked to use with page numbers. The problem is there are no page numbers so the index is completely useless. There are location numbers on the kindle but they don't line up with the index. I'll give the author a break and say I might have liked it as a reference book if it was edited so the index could be used but not as a book to read through and memorize. I feel I got ripped off because someone missed this problem."
positive,It's my favorite novel: I read its Korean version and I bought English version.The title was different(The outsider) but no problem with it.
positive,"Our family of 3 had to get 2!!: Santa gave this to our 8 yr old daughter in her stocking for Christmas. However, after I continually played with it all Christmas Day my husband had to get one for me! The new one is the large print version which is a rectangle - approx. 6 in. long. Additionally, the large print has other answer options - rarely, sometimes. Some very obscure items it has guessed are: angel, cruise missile (!!!! WOW), hand grenade, ant, devil, and dragon. I definitely recommend the game - for individual or group play. However, I agree that the sarcastic teasing from the game gets old fast!"
positive,"Super Sexy: Let's be honest here. You buy this product for one reason only; to see your baby in it for 5 minutes before you strip it from her and have some fun.This product worked, it looks fabulous on her body, it really frames her buns perfectly and her DDs look fantastic in it as well. She managed to keep it on her body for 30 minutes...I was tied up!You will love this body stocking."
negative,"Too broad and too liitle info: Not knowing Wind River the guide really did very little to help plan a trip excpet for forming a general idea of where to go and what to see and climb. On this level it fulfilled it's job, but I was hoping for much more."
positive,"Dramatic and mostly accurate: Gore Vidal's Lincoln is about as good as anything I've seen on ""Lincoln the Man."" And it almost captures Mary Todd Lincoln as well, almost but not quite. Highly recommended for those who wish to see a portrait of the domestic and political Lincoln."
positive,"Dixie Carters Yoga Tape, the unworkout: I find her style and humor very relaxing and easy to do. Highly recommned it to any of the more mature ladies just getting started and who don't want to spend a lot of time."
positive,"A must have for chess hobbyists and connoisseurs: Out of the 20+ chess titles in my library, My Chess Career, by Capablanca, remains my favorite.The first hand explanations from the eventual world champion are useful, but sometimes abrupt. Nonetheless, the value of any of his commentary, in combination with games showing his historical development and clean elegant playing style, is simply a joy to read.This book is more historical in intent than educational, yet my playing improved more through reading this chess book than any other, including those intended as educational.Not meant for the beginner, yet, not much skill is required to enjoy it. A great read."
positive,"rites of passion: I found this moive to be great and interesitng. Most of the time people don't realize how hard it is to be a gay man, living in a world where parents find it hard to accept reality. This movie is focused on how a man deals with his father's hatred toward gay men and to make him realize that it's O.K to be different. Top quality movie, a must see."
negative,"Not What I Expected: Finding out I was pregnant with twins was moving, exciting, shocking and scary. I wanted a book that would help me understand how my pregnancy would be different to a singleton pregnancy, what to expect and some guidelines on how to look after myself. Although the book was informative and I loved the little comments made my mothers of multiples in the borders I didn't feel satisfied. I was more worried than before as the book goes into so much detail about the loss of a twin (this was the majority of a book) and premature labor. It started out good explaining the types of multiples and how common they are (or not) was interesting but there were very few pictures and I found it to be quite long winded. I must say that although this book was informative I felt more worried and anxious for my twins after reading it than before and was left still not knowing what to expect during my pregnancy."
negative,"I didn't get it.: Ok, so he's a punk. He has a gang, and he's pretty... You know... Alpha male. They go around and raise hell. They apparently raised so much this one time some victims die. Well, he gets arrested and they do this association program where violence, sex, and unfortunately Beethoven will make him sick.So he gets out... And it happens. His friends become cops and they turn on him. He runs into a victim of his and he knows what happened to him, locks him into this room and plays Beethoven and completely tortures him. He jumps out of a window and finds himself in a hospital with a lawyer who can apparently litigate him out of this situation.End of story....Pointless. So was Full Metal Jacket... But... That's a popular one too"
negative,"bad quality, does not grow.: I sped the seed, even with rain the seed did not cover what the package indicated, not even close."
negative,How can I write a book ? I to can ask my neighbors!: It is not worth buying ! If this a must read for you go to our public library. You just might thank me!
negative,Doesn't work: This product will come up with the networks in the area. If you put in the network pass key it will connect then immediately disconnect. I bought it because I don't have alot of money and I wanted to get a wireless adapter cheap. Don't buy. Fork out the extra money on a better adapter.
negative,Baby WET: These are awful. I have to change these constantly because they do not pull moisture away from baby's bottom. So annoyed that I bought such a big box.
negative,"Junk: About 30% of the time this printer will actually recognize that it does, in fact, have paper in the feed tray; often paper needs to be fed by hand. It also jams about 50% of all paper that goes through it. You cannot simply tell the computer to print a document and walk away from it; you have to sit there the entire time, feeding individual pieces of paper into the printer and pulling out the jams one by one. Also don't even think about running it without both ink cartridges. When my color cartridge ran out, I let it go because I don't do a lot of color printing. HP apparently really wants me to go out and buy another fifty-dollar cartridge because in all honesty about every two seconds during a print job (between the constant paper jam and lack of paper in tray messages) I received a pop-up telling me that I needed a color cartridge.I think I'll go back to Canon."
positive,In the beginning: Listen to this album and you will here what all the San Francisco bands were doing a year after each release. Skip Spence was important and burnt out early but the best songs were penned by the other members. I hear riffs from the best songs from the late 60's and early 70's from this group.
positive,"This is a well written and carefully thought out book: I am a great fan of Science Fantasy. This book delivers in such a charming way that I passed it on to my two daughters, aged 13 and 20, who also have enjoyed the book. This author has a long career ahead of him. Any child who even thinks of writing should read Eragon. This book is getting a lot of Word of Mouth advertising in my area. Adults and children are finding it and passing it on to others. This is a must read."
negative,"Save your money: This book really [is bad]. I have done image streaming fora while now. I do it 30 minutes,twice a day and have gonethrough many a trigger and have seen NO IMAGES period.The only thing I do see is kaleidoscopic patterns of lightappear before me when I shut my eyes, and other wierd blobsof light patterns. But I didn't need Wenger to tell me this.He is getting two stars for the following reasons[1]showing me what I already have expereinced.[2]for being honest in stating that 30% of people who doimage streaming will fail !I am his waterloo !Despite this nasty review I will do image-streaming for a bitlonger-for a couple of weeks longer at max and if no improve-ment - [end] this method."
negative,"This edition SUCKS!: Full Screen Edition dvds suck (UNLESS IT WAS filmed that way). Full Screen crops the theatrical picture to 4:3 ratio which is the shape of a standard (non-widescreen) TV screen. There is no letterboxing, but up to a third of the original picture is lost. WIDESCREEN preserves the original theatrical picture ratio of the film which will appear in ""letterboxed"" format on a normal TV screen. If the movie is going to be modified from it's original version then It should not cost as much."
positive,"There lived a Hobbit!: I first read the Hobbit over 30 years ago. At that time it was probably my favorite book (I was 9.) Here it is all these years later and I still really enjoy this great book. Not to long ago I read it to my children and I was again amazed at how well Tolkien takes his readers and actually brings them to Middle Earth. This story of Bilbo, Gandalf and the Dwarves, and their journey There and back again, is an outstanding prequel to probably the best work of fantasy ever written."
positive,"If you like adventure and fantasy, you will love this book.: I first read this in the Eighth Grade. I loved it then, and it has only gotten better with age. It reads well, and keeps you interested from the very first chapter. The Characters are intriguing and develop well as the story progresses. The author's description of scenery and characters is outstanding, though sometimes it does get a little long, the story line will keep you hooked up until the very end. I cannot wait to re-read Eldest, and read for the first time the last two books."
positive,"Fair and Tender Ladies: I would give Fair and Tender Ladies by Lee Smith 100 stars!! Oh my word! I love this book!! It is beautifully written. I absolutely love Ivy! She is a strong, funny, fascinating character. This book is a new favorite for me!"
negative,"this is music?: no no. this ""flash-in-the-pan"" will fade from all our minds in a couple of months. this is not genuine stuff, it seems to be contrived or tries too hard. please dont make any more records and take that Medusa ""head full of snakes"" hair-do with you."
positive,"Not quite five stars...: Historically accurate and shot on location, this is an interesting film. Decidedly so. It even portrays some of Luther's very personal battles with Satan, which surprised me. But the movie suffers where most religious films suffer, it only gives a superficial treatment of Luther's beliefs. The movie is historical moments which hint at the underlying theology only. Having been so bold as to depict Luther striving against the devil during his early years and during his trial at Worms, the film leaves out his greatest fight with the prince of darkness which came as he was translating the Bible into common German. This is the famous fight that ended with Luther throwing an inkwell across the room into the apparition of Satan to dispel it. This omission of Luther's most overt battle with evil and the glossing over of Luther's ideas render this otherwise excellent film a less than perfect, four star effort. Still worth seeing though."
positive,"Very well researched and written.: Reading this book was an emotional experience. The author was able to describe scenes so accurate that I actually felt as if I were that little 5 year old girl, lost in the wilderness, hungry, cold, tired, delusional, and frightened. I was captivated with this series and reread all four books five times already. I've learned more about survival from this book than I have from 12 years in our public school systems. Great job. When's the wedding going to be written?"
negative,Junk: This wireless camera only works 5 ft away from the receiver. It is supposed to be 100m. What is the point of wireless if you have to be that close?
positive,"Dickies girl pinstripe: I absolutly LOVE these pants. They got here quick, they fit perfect, my boyfriend loves how they look on me. They are perfect for at work or to go to an interview, or even to go out in. The pinstripes are really slimming, they totally make you look skinnier, and I get compliments on them everywhere I go."
positive,The best!: I originally read this book in my bathroom around 1-3am every night til done back in the late 80s (pregant too!). What more can one say?
positive,"Blues-psych, somewhat like Cream: 1969 blues-psych. Reminds me of Cream though not as good. Singer is Scottish and really has the accent at times. Good if you like this type of music."
positive,Love my Total woman vitamins.: I love my Total Woman vitamins. I got my vitamins for a great price and fast delivery. I would definitely order from them again.
negative,"So disppointed: I was so shocked as I watched Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story, This is not Anne and Gilbert's Story.We had waited so long, and were over the moon when we hear that Part 3 was on its way.To be honesty, Mr Sullivan you should NOT have bothered and got our hopes up so. Rilla,s story yes, difference characters a whole new story great, but this was not Anne of Green Gables. It is so out of sync.Buying it was a waste of money, watching it a waste of time for LMM lovers and any one who loved and cherished the First two parts. If you just HAVE to watch it borrow it from the Library."
positive,Tivo Wireless G USB adapter works perfectly: Does exactly as advertised. Easy installation. Good price compared to the same item at other stores.
negative,"Wrong track in MP3 download album: Don't know how to report this to Amazon but track 17 is same as 16 on the MP3 download album............Byrds fan, Jim"
positive,"Raw honesty, very healing: This riveting, poetic account of childhood suffering reaches deep into early trauma and abuse. Reading this gripping account will help you access your own childhood memories and heal from abuse. Thank you for the courage to write this book!"
negative,"Veto and disregard: This book is not worth the time to read or even browse. Stick with his ""Five Day Course in Thinking"" if you can find a copy or his ""Thinking Course."""
positive,A Keeper: This movie ranks right up there with some of my most favorite comedies. Definitely one that I'll watch over and over again.
positive,"Over Mucho Grande?: No, I will never be over Mucho Grande...those wounds run awful deep.In a galaxy far, far,far,far,far,far,far,far,far away, the lovely Princess smiled as she saw the knight enter her room. The princess took off her dress, revealing her lovely round...Wait a minute! This is Airplane II, not star wars! This movie is just as good as the oringal, and has more one liners!""We all have our little blinking buttons""""Over Mucho Grande?""""Ted Striker got more guts in him than we got in our little finger, INCLUDING THE COLON!"""
negative,What a junk: What a junk. Every time NOMAD thinks the file is corrupt the OS freezes. The only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode. So if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen OS you can't use NOMAD until you get home. After OS froze twice on me in the subway I returned the jukebox.
positive,"The beginning of it all..: ""The Hobbit,"" the prequel to the legendary Lord of the Rings, is an excellent adventure story for readers of all ages. I particularly recommend it to younger readers, as it is not very hard to read and is easy to follow. It is a very wonderful gift to young ""Harry Potter"" fans, because it has the same wonder that captures the imagination. However, seasoned SF/fantasy readers (such as I) will probably see it as merely a stepping-stone for LoTR. While I enjoy this book very much, I feel it is not on the same level as the books that followed. Still, I recommend reading ""The Hobbit"" before you tackle ""The Lord of The Rings"" and ""The Silmarillion."""
negative,"Not what expected: As a Noni user for many years, when my preferred vendor had some delivery delays ordered this brand of Noni. When it arrived was disappointed to see not PURE Noni juice, but rather adulterated Noni with fruit juice. I use NONI not for the taste, but the health benefits, yes NONI tastes bad, but I want the benefit of the NONI not additives to make it taste better. Can't recommend this product."
positive,It's a Classic: I'm a fan of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings and decided to re-read the book. It was as exciting as I remembered and even better the second time around.
negative,"Save Your Money - Buy a Surefire or MagLite: I don't usually write reviews, but this product is so bad that I wanted to warn others. I own many fine flashlights, and I am afraid this is not one of them. First, the flashlight drains batteries even when it is off. I wrote to Smith and Wesson, and they referred me to the company that produces the flashlights for them, Powertech. Powertech will not respond to e-mails/voicemails. Even with new batteries, the light from the 3 white LED's is inadequate (I would say it is around 15 lumens or so at best), and the UV beam is even weaker. Would be good for detailed work (up close hobbies and the like) but completely inadequate outdoors for hunting and tracking purposes. For the same price, the new 3 watt LED mini-mag lite is a suprisingly good option. It has a powerful beam that can be focused. My advice would be to spend $10 bucks more and get a Surefire G2 Nitrolon. This is a horrible product, and I would strongly advise against purchasing it."
negative,One of the worst six sigma reference: This is one of the worst written six sigma book I have read. It has neither depth or clarityThere are also many mistakes in the book. The formatting is also badly done. It is a poor effort and I am shock that this book is associated with ASQ.
positive,The Isaiah Effect: Decoding the Lost Science of Prayer and Prophecy: Very insightful and interesting. Gregg Braden is offering the world a hope for peace. This book transends all religion and offers unity to all people.
negative,"Horrible: This product was a completely disappointing i hate it . it does nothing it says it does .It does nothing for my hair , it does not straighten it , it leaves it looking dull and wavy ."
positive,"Buying another one!: I bought the original 4 years ago, have loved it, and am buying the remanufactured one for our vacation home. I expect it (after reading all the other reviews) to perform exactly like my original, which is still performing beautifully. Looks great on the kitchen counter, too--very classy."
positive,Great item: I was told about this product by a friend. Wow I love it.Not sure how I lived with out it. Will tell my friends.
negative,"Skip It: The author fills up a great deal of space with musings about her own family and her own life. She makes huge, inaccurate assumptions about all redheads based upon herself, none of which apply to me, also a natural redhead. The author has a decidedly Christian perspective, which, as a Jewish redhead, I found distasteful. I thought this book would reveal some fascinating information about red hair, but it was sorely disappointing. A waste of time, really."
positive,In good condition: Always nervous about purchasing a VHS tape ...but wanted to see this version of the movie and it was the only format in which I found this version available. In exactly the condition as advertised. Played perfectly.
positive,"excellent!!: I feel no need to write a long drawn out review here. Pure and simple this is one of Enya's best albums. I have been a dedicated fan since Watermark came out many many years ago and this CD is just incredible, the best I think since Watermark. You must buy this!"
negative,"Died too soon: I purchased my Keurig 3 years ago as well as one for friends as a gift. Both machines broke within a month of each other with same problem. I am so incredibly disappointed. I loved this machine! It is great while it lasts. But beware, it is not built to last long term. Like other reviewers mentioned, Keurig offered to sell me another at $79. My friend I gave it to was much luckier; they actually replaced hers even though it was out of warranty."
positive,"My personal favorite Cachao recording...: This may be my favorite Cachao recording. This and part two, along with both Master Sessions and the ""Descargas en Miniature."" It's hard to choose a favorite, obviously. The personnel on this set is reduced from the other descarga sessions. It's a quartet. Piano, bass, drums (trap set), and percussion.Incidentally: Walfredo Reyes Sr., Master Drummer on this session, born in Havana, would no doubt recoil from the assertion that this stellar group lacks the power of some of Cachao's other groups. Or, for that matter, that this particular Cachao group does not contain Cubans...This set is dynamite.Song titles include:CalienteMe Esta GustandoLocoQuinto Con VibrafonWalpatacaLa LeccionWalfredoTodo El CorazonMusicians include:Francisco (Paquito) Hechavarria Acoustic piano, vibesIsrael Lopez (Cachao) Acoustic bassTany Gil Congas, percussionWalfredo De Los Reyes Drums and percussion"
positive,Useful: This tent was very useful and easy to put together. I used it at my home and even my 5 year old liked to hang out in it. We used it for my infant at the beach one afternoon and it was perfect for blocking the sun and having time in it.
negative,"Cheap corkscrew: It's awful. I bought it because I wanted a red corkscrew. However, the description does not state how cheaply it is made. Each time I use it I'm afraid it's going to break when I turn it. It's plastic. DO NOT BUY!"
positive,Outstanding Album!: This album gives a listener a better view of Bing Crosby talent and how he is so much more than White Christmas. These songs are mostly original and well produced. Bing sings very well and is very talented. Wonderful album and can't recommend it enough.
negative,"If you can't sleep read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Well I read this book with some great expectations and I shouldn't have. I figured that it was going to be a wonderful book because of the author (wrong) Ihad to strugle just to read 2 pages without getting sleepy. Altough I have great respect for Dickens and all of his accomplishments, I did NOT like this book !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
negative,"Couldnt get to the story: I thought the story line sounded interesting so i bought it...twice! Trying to get a version of the book that wasnt so diffucult to read, its ok off and on, half the time i dont know what the author is referring to cause it was written so long ago that the author uses that language and it just got in my way of the story, which is why i bought it again thinking the 2nd book looked easier to read but it wasnt...sadly i will be reduced to trying to find the movie to find out what happens and it bothers me because i hate to not finish a book!"
negative,"read the book again: the pictures and music are better: Awful. Shabby animation, horrid music (the other reviewers impugn hippies by alleging the music is somehow ""hippie-ish"").The story is cut to pieces and the ""acting"" is elementary school quality. It's obviously edited to be shown as a TV series (read: commercial schlock).It's a great story, totally trivialized by this crummy production. Avoid at all costs. The single star is the least I can give."
positive,spider-man 2 full screen specia edition: it was all great it was like new went i got it and more like he said about it i will buy from him again i give on this a great 100% and more ty cw
negative,"Makes Silver and Gold sound like Black Sabbath: Bummer.Am I the first one to point out that ""No Wonder"" mercilessly steals the melody from ""World on a String?""Anyway, I'm doing what I did with Broken Arrow, Are You Passionate, Landing on Water, and Mirror Ball - teaching myself to like this album. Beacuse it's Neil, you know. And he's the king. And part of being a fan of Neil's is getting burned. But this is some third degree stuff here. Tepid, lifeless, by the numbers. Neil has never sounded so 'phoned in.' Auto-pilot. Take your pick from any of the rock crit cliches - this is grim.That said, aside from the production, some songs are quite nice the seventh time through.I guess it's working."
negative,"quite good: this is a very critical album. the songs like forest ""why can't you see that you are my child?"" yeah that's quite a good question... chop suey! is one of the greatest songs ever!"
positive,"Not bad.: I would like to have this CD, but where the hell is the song ""In Your Eyes""? That song is one of the best Peter Gabriel songs that I ever heard and this CD is not complete to me w/o this song on it."
positive,Great film-unimpressive DVD: For such a great film the DVD to it was disappointing. NO extras. The movie is only 13 years old. There could have been such extras to put on the disc. Disney needs to go to extras school.
negative,"Not memorable for many adult readers: Christopher Paolini did an amazing job to write this book at the age of 17. However, the imagination and originality of Eragon is lacking. It seems as if the plot is derived from a mixture of a number of past fantasy novels. Overall, the plot contains trite ideas and themes. Character development, and especially emotional development, are areas that are weak. It is a fairly good book, especially for younger readers, but there is not much substance and originality to make it memorable for older readers."
positive,"Just another great movie...: Ashley Judd does it again in this movie. I loved the emotional roller coaster she goes through. I felt every emotion right with her. Also, Hugh Jackman is sexy as hell. Greg Kinear is cute as a weasle. The story line is predictable but it kept my interest. Guess who is also cast in this movie...Marisa Tomei. Where the hell has she been? Her character was okay, but Ashley was terrific. You Better Act Girl!"
positive,"Money can't buy cds like this.....: As I write this review I am listening to the title track, First Circle. I became infatuated with Pat Metheny within the last couple of months and stumbled upon this cd through research of this wonderful musician. I bought the cd used for a less than average price. The title track alone actually makes me feel guilty that I didn't pay hundreds of dollars for the cd. Just as others have said, you cannot put into words what this song DOES to you. It Inspires you, which I believe is the best compliment you could possibly give to a piece of music. Please purchase this cd and play the title track as loud as feesibly possible, and if it doesn't truly change your outlook on life then you must not be living, and you surely don't know what music MEANS.I know these must seem like strong words, but do yourself a favor and see for yourself."
positive,CBW: I feel so great after this workout. It is a real challange but fun. I like the way he switches body parts. It keeps it interesting and it keeps me motivated. I know when I just think I can't go on he will switch to a different muscle group and I can continue. My kids have tried to do it with me but they haven't been able to keep up as yet. When the going gets rough I wish I could jump in the wonderful ocean behind Gilad. It is the best video of its kind that I have ever used. Thanks!
negative,"BORING, BORING, BORING: This is so boring I dont even want to review it , HA HA, P>S - new one coming out 2006 of october"
positive,"The Beginning...: I know it sounds a little cheesy now, but for the time, it was way kewl. Depeche Mode are pioneers of synth-pop, and have evolved into an underground sensation and beyond. My favorites are: ""New life""-Bouncy and jivey. ""Puppets""-Dark and juicy. ""Photographic""-Awesome. Perverted? ""Tora, tora, tora""-Slammin and energetic. ""Voices""-Martin sings this one. Vintage Mode. This is a campy joyride! Put it on and get all sappy, remembering how cool the 80's actually were..."
negative,"it was very slow.: Hawthorne was a excellent writer for the 19th century, however, this book is very slow and often has no dialog for over a chapter. The descriptions get very long, boring and tedious. As you read this book your mind starts to wander and you can't remember what happened for chapters at a time. The only was I was able to get through it was by reading Cliffs Notes then the book."
positive,"Good Book: This is the autobiography of a school teacher in Northern Kentucky, he comes across different obstacles some of those 2 churchs that have divided the county almost like opposing armies, violent students and many other problems. Be he still runs a successful country school.""The Needles Eye That Does Supply'""The Thread That Runs So True!"""
positive,"Very effective cleaning: This mop is easy to use and very effective. My floor has never looked this clean, and with no harsh chemicals (I used a mixture of borax, castille soap, and hot water). I also love that I'm not creating waste every time I mop my floor. I have two reservations, though, although one may be silly: 1) The microfiber pads shrink considerably with the first use and don't seem to cover the whole mop head anymore. Perhaps I washed them incorrectly, but there were no laundry instructions included. 2) The mop is very light and the swivel head makes it easy to get at tight spots, but I'm concerned the mop handle might not be very durable because it's so thin and light. So far, so good, so I might be worrying over nothing, and I have no reservations about how effectively it cleans my floors."
positive,"Wiccan imagry, but not unfamiliar to anyone...: the Tarot of the Old Path is certainly pagan in tone. the illustrations are subtle, incorporating traditional tarot symbols (like the two pillars in the high priestess card)without being any less origional. i found that the cards had enough similarity to standard rider-waite decks to be familiar, but were much more attuned to Wiccan philosophy than to ceremonial magick. I would recomend this deck to Wiccans and Pagans primarily, but also to anyone who collects or likes a variety of artwork."
negative,"What the hell?: I'm a big fan of zombie movies, but I thought that this movie is not that good. I didn't care at all for the idea of slug parasites causing a zombie outbreak."
positive,"Still Relevent: Is the book outdated? Have people finally learned that they are closing their minds? Unfortunately people still need the message of Fahrenheit 451. Most people are still convinced that God becomes angry and, what is worse, far worse, they are still burning books today when they ignore new ideas."
negative,"Poor, lackluster: I bought this video after reading so many great reviews of it. Even coming from an office environment I found almost no really funny parts -- for me the movie just dragged on and on - I kept watching waiting for it to pick up - up to the end..."
positive,"Absolute genious.: This album is fantastic. Beautifully crafted and skillfully mixed, this album is an often-overlooked masterpiece. David Thrussel says all he needs to say without the use of vocals/lyrics, something that is difficult to accomplish. Dark and brooding, while at times being confusing, TCDA evokes every emotion from fear to anger to ecstacy.I don't really need to bother highlighting the best tracks... every song is amazing. The album would be considered experimental and strange to most electronic music fans, but Thrussel has been doing this for years and no longer needs to experiment; he's got it down to a science."
negative,"Why are there soooo many ladders here???: While my wife and I are fans of this genre of film, we were at first appalled, and then disgusted by this poorly executed version. Some people have praised the fight sequences, but I found them lacking for the most part, and laughable in others--esp. the men on ropes on the castle's turret, and in the room full of ladders. Why were there so many ladders there anyway? Most disturbing were the inconsistencies in the plot. Why doesn't the hero make it back to the queen BEFORE the bad guys whom he beats up at the river scene? Why does he ride to Paris rather than to the ferry, where he could have saved Lord Buckingham and foiled the cardinal's plot? Why was this movie even made?? Save your money...we were disappointed even though we only rented it."
positive,"Right on the Money: Perfect for the hot dog bar at my son's Mickey Mouse Carnival themed birthday party. The dogs were thoroughly cooked, and the machine itself was precious. Break down of the item allowed for easy cleaning and storing after the event. The machine is covered by a thin plastic (not fantastic quality), but it was sturdy enough to get the job done and to be expected for the price."
negative,"not worth the money: I generally expect to get what I pay for...I think I paid $15 for this thing so I really wasn't expecting much from it. Well that's exactly what I got. Even from as little as 7 feet away, my signal strength was under 50% and sometimes would totally go away. I wish I wouldn't have wasted that money - don't waste yours. This is one product Airlink shouldn't have put out."
positive,Outrageous: I bought this dvd for my personal use and to share with friends because there is a lot of cases regarding the transmission of HIV in my country (Belize) and I believe that this dvd really opened a lot of eyes that were closed. It's very useful when trying to speak to individuals in a suttle way.Spink
positive,"A positive influence in my life....: Ashanti may not be Aaliyah, but I believe Ashanti has found her own new sound in the song 'Happy'. It's very upbeat and in typical R&b Style has a catchy hook that you cant get out of your head. Happy is the kind of song that gets you just there, Happy. Even if you don't like this immediately it will grow on you."
negative,"The Worst risk management book: It is the worst risk management book I have ever read. Poor organization and explanation, make the matter difficult to be understood. It is a very disappointing book suggested by GARP. I am a CFA charter, I have good knowledge in most of the subjects, I still think difficult in reading this book because of its poor explanation."
negative,"not happy: when we recieved this product it looked ok, but when it was played, it skipped, we were not happy at all, cost too much to return so take it for its worth ,ty and no, i didnt try to contact the dealer, maybe they would have maDE IT GOOD TY MUCH"
positive,yummy: Clay is sooooooooooooo delicious. Everytime I listen to this masterpiece I like it even more! For the first time in my life I have been brought to tears by a VOICE.
positive,"Very informative!: My husband and I didn't have time to attend an 8 hour birthing class at the hospital, so we opted for this video. It was very informative and helped us understand what was happening when we went to the hospital. It was a little cheesy, but definitely worth getting."
positive,Good: I have not really had a chance to use these but my daughter states that it works for her very well.
negative,"alright, what the heck is this: After I was done chugging through this crap, I felt naseous, delirious, and wondering why I just wasted 5 days of my life. Stephen King apparently wrote this while he was recovering from a car accident, and you can definitely tell from the 500 pages of incessant rambling that is a pathetic excuse for character development. The other 200 pages are actually used for good scary plot development, which is not much, but it prevented me from burning this damn thing. In this 700 page monster chalk full of gore and utterly repulsive images, I could sense a trace of good ideas smothered under meaningless words which is why i give this 2 stars instead of 1. To anyone interested in literature: I do not recommend this. To anyone who likes to read about gross things and is good at skimming: do as you wish."
negative,"A lovely book, but short on specifics.: This is a beautiful book and terrific fun for a woodworker to read for enjoyment, but it's short on specific solutions. Attempting to be all things to all woodworkers, it is of little value to anyone--except to spark the imagination. The best part of the book are the beautiful photos that peek inside the workshops of great artisans around the country. But if you seek step-by-step advice, look elsewhere."
negative,"Not Really Accurate: I had thought that this book and the sample Exam on the CD would be a realy close reflection of the exam content. But whan I took the exam, it didn't seem like that was the case. The book and sample exam seemed to focus on Admin. stuff while the exam seemed to emphasize SQL, TSQL and database design a lot more. I also don't think the book prepares you for security-related questions very well. But it might still be worthwhile for someone who feels ready to take the exam and just wants some practice."
positive,"very entertaining but a little stagy: This is a film version of a Philip Barry play, and like ""The Philadelphia Story"" (which he also wrote, and the film version of which also stars Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn) this movie has sparkling dialogue, memorable supporting characters, and occasional heavy-handed commentary. But it's very entertaining, and the leads and most of the supporting cast are great. Grant, in particular, manages to give a very effective and human performance in a role that could easily be a plot device, and Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon are a total hoot as the very unconventional friends of Grant."
positive,"Good ole Rocker and soft in places: Back To The Egg is Back To The Roots!, March 4, 2001I rate ""Back To The Egg"" as one of McCartney & Wings best (in my opinion). I rate it with ""Ram"", ""Wildlife"" & McCartney. It's production is raw and gives it a live take feel. If you like some good ole rock, this is a good'n! ..."
negative,"Don't waste your money: This watchtower was never used by the manufacturer because the unit itself comes with 3 legs that could likely hold one pound of weight and this weighs several. The ""legs"" don't even lock in place, they just sit in groves so the minute you place the weight on it they collapse over and over. If you manage to get it to stand the minute your child touches it it will fall over. Otherwise it would have been a wonderful toy. It looks like the show and the body is sturdy and well put together. Too well put together to be supported by the legs provided. Don't buy it, if your child is younger talk them into the Spiderman playset, much more sturdy."
positive,really cute: I bought this book because I own Bad Cat. I think this book is witty and funny but not quite as good as the cat one. Most of the pictures did make me crack up laughing but I laughed harder and at more pictures in the cat book. I would still recommend it to anyone as it is really funny but they should definitely buy Bad Cat as well.
negative,"Defective?: Within 6 months of installation, over half of the lights illuminating the buttons went out leaving me to search for the buttons at night time. Why go for the buttons when I have a remote, you ask? This is because apparently the remote cannot hold up to frequent use. The most frequently used buttons (which are like little bubbles) cracked and the covering came off. It's almost impossible to use the buttons without the covering over the remote board because it doesn't recognize when just your fingers are pushing on the bare board. Also, after going on the official Pyle website, the ""Contact Us"" link is apparently the only link that didn't, and still doesn't (4 months later) work so I emailed them through one of their other links (regarding some other question, but inquired about my issues) yet still have not received a response."
positive,"BATTERY CHARGER: WE HAVE ONLY HAD THIS BATTERY CHARGER FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS NOW, BUT IT HAS PERFORMED VERY WELL. IT IS USED FIVE DAYS A WEEK, AND AT LEAST 2 OR THREE TIMES A DAY AT OUR SHOP. HANDS DOWN IT IS ONE OF THE BEST BATTERY CHARGEERS WE HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME."
positive,"A good cd but this isn't the KLF/MuMu ""2K"": While an interesting cd be forewarned it's not the 2K that sprang up out of the ashes of The Timelords, KLF and related projects...it's some guys in Chicago with no relation to the aforementioned Cauty and Drummond."
negative,"Don't waste your money.....: I purchased this Hugger Mugger mat based on the reviews above....big mistake. I attend yoga classes 2-3 times a week, so I have had a chance to so through a number of mat's in 4+ years. I gave this mat about 2 months before I decided to submit a review. I don't see ANY redeeming quality about this mat...NONE. Not only is it not durable, but if you get even a slight amount of moisture on the palms of your hand, and you will slip all over this mat. Remember the 'slip and slide' mats when you were a kid?? I think this yoga mat is made of the same material. Stay away at all cost....."
positive,Stitch 'N Bitch: Came in good condition inspite of being well loved before and I have already made something from the book and refered to it on other projects. Written in a very vampy and cute style.
negative,"Pathetic: The first time I listened to this album I was thoroughly disgusted. Repeated listens did nothing to endear me to it.This album basically sounds like it was written by a band that listened to ""System of a Down"" and thrashed out a really bad rip-off of it. Get the band's self-titled album and avoid this piece of garbage."
negative,"Built like a 1980's American car!: The machine was great while it worked. Just after the warranty expired my ""Ionic Breeze"" completely stopped working. For [the price] I expected quality!"
negative,"Unreliable product: This product broke down after one month of regular use. This is not what I would have expected from a ""premium"" product. The manufacturing quality of this product is clearly far below where it should be."
positive,GOOD PURCHASE!: I love this purchase and I would recommend it to any one to purchase this item for their fun and excitement!
negative,"Not a film for Asimov fans: Ugh.Asimov fans will cringe at this crude adaptation of his works. I found it to be bland, action-packed tripe, which failed to underlie the basic principles of Asimov story-telling; cerebral, mystery, detective - all of these styles are to be found in his books. Alas, not in this film.For someone who has never read an Asimov book, then this film as a complete standalone is mildly sufficient, that is if you like your action films set to a prediciatble formula; good cool guy, love interest, simmering tension building up to a grand finale. You get that here.Myself, I prefer something a little more thought-provoking.Like one of Issac Asimov's books, for instance."
positive,Works great: It lifts the front tire up keeping the pressure off my arms and wrist.Glad it stacks that makes it so much more valuable to me.
positive,"Jesse: The book, Jesse, by Gary Soto is about a Mexican boy and his brother Abel who are tryinng to go to college and pass. This a completey believable book. It has real life situations that would really happen to mostly Mexican families. They have an abusive stepdad who just drinks and thinks less of his kids, Jesse and Abel. They are trying to get to college and when they do it seem like the whole world is against Jesse, in love,work and college. In fact he notices that society is against the Mexicans in general for work and education. And during these hardships he has to get through somehow.This book relates to me because of the hardships Mexicans and all immigrants are going through now because of prop HR4437.In general the prop represents the people in the book Jesse.just like the prop the people are against Mexicans. Somehow he will get through and so will we against prop HR4437."
positive,"See this movie!: See this movie! If you're anything like me(a hopeless romantic)you'll never be the same again!I've had it on video for ten years and watch it as often as I can. I used to dance all throughout my childhood (tap, ballet, jazz, etc), but as soon as I saw this movie when I was 15, I switched to Latin-American dancing and it's been my profession ever since.The music and the love displayed in this movie really makes you want to get up and express yourself through dance. Patrick Swayze is a joy to watch. Throughout my entire career I have never seen a man dance as well as him. Any woman or girl who hasn't seen this movie will fall in love with it instantly, but I also believe it is good for men to see this movie to get a taste of what women really want -not just a hunky guy, but a man who can show his true feelings."
positive,"Santa Cruz: Got this to replace the Creative Value Live! card on an XP system to see if strings would stop sounding like finger nails scraping a black board and it worked! The software interface is intellegent compared to Creatives kiddy junk and it's very easy to use. The Santa Cruz also doesn't distort piano notes or voice. The bundled software is kind of deceptive, most of it being demos, and the lite editions are truly ""light"" making them fairly useless if you want to use Midi. Overall I would still chose Turtle Beach over Creative being lower cost, better performance, easy to use and setup, and designed for people who are older than 12."
negative,"Shaming Beowulf...: This movie was, in short, terrible. The storyline was filled with holes and didn't even come close to following the original epic written so long ago.The actors almost seemed to be ashamed of themselves for taking part in this F-movie production. Simply because Christopher Lambert can wield a sword doesn't make him right for the part of a warrior as great as Beowulf was meant to be. Rhona Mitra was a waste of a character. As was Gotz Otto. Out of all the characters that were written in the epic poem only two of the original names were used. The rest were changed or omited unnecessarily.The creature they came up with for Grendel was cheap and even silly to say the least. The rest of the special effects were second rate as were the actors.The end scene with Grendel's mother was drawn out and sad.If you want to see a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the great epic of Beowulf then buy otherwise save your money for something better."
negative,"Very disappointed, no cover: Its very strange that the comfort-u pillow did not go with a cover. This is the 3rd comfort-u support pillow I have, and for the first 2 plain white cover was always included in the box at the same price$99.5."
negative,"50 Fast and Bad Techniques: This book doesn't give much explanations and for a reason: it looks like the author is not profficient in what he tries to teach. Some of his advices are dead wrong, for example converting color to b&w: his method gives far inferior results to proper techniques (there are more than one). The method he suggests is definitely the fastest - probably for this very reason almost every book or Web Tutorial (there are dozens of them) will tell you why you should avoid this method. I returned the book and won't recomend it to anyone, beginner or intermidiate. Check other books, like Scott Kelby's ""Photoshop 6 Photo-Retouching Secrets"" or Martin Evening's ""Adobe Photoshop 6.0 for Photographers"" (this one is for more advanced readers) and see for yourself."
negative,"Rashel: Ugh, I don't get it how all these people can like Rashel. To me she was an extremely annoying person because it always seemed like she was bragging about her ""amazing fighting abilities"". Also, she would always make these ""quips"" that were supposed to make her seem tough, impressive, and heroic but just made me feel like once again she was being annoying. The bad thing is that she is like this the entire book. The book has a nice plot and everything but if I can't stand the main character then that just ruins everything. Sorry."
negative,"Crappy Coffee Maker: This coffee pot stopped working with a minimum of use. We had only had it a few months, but were gone for over a month of that time and it was getting no use at all. Plus, my husband is the only drinker of coffee, so it was barely broken in. Of course it stopped working a week after it was possible to make a return. Disgusting waste of money! Do not buy!!"
negative,"Awful, just awful: Armand Assante is one of the worst actors I have ever had the misfortune to watch. He could not act dead if you put a bullet in his brain. The odyssey is a great story and it deserves a great actor. I would rate this movie zero stars if I had the option."
negative,"good cd, won't play on my laptop anymore!: while certainly not Santana's best cd, the copywrite protection thing is a nightmare. I ""installed"" (not by my choice) this on my laptop to listen to it and it worked the first day, but never again. what a nightmare. I don't have any interest in watching anything on a music cd (they should really offer different versions so people can choose) so the software included was not only worthless but a serious problem. I was going to buy 2 more copies for people for christmas presents but I wouldn't do this to them. Maybe they can just download the songs from applemusic. geez, i won't ever buy another cd like this and frankly, i'd like my money back or to get one that doesn't do this garbage!"
positive,"Overall a very good cd: Although it doesn't come out of the corner swinging like ""R"" and ""Songs For The Deaf"" it's a long round fighter so to speak, the longer you listen to it the more it knocks you out. Queens of the Stone age are one of those bands that has staying power, even after losing one of the founding members, Joshua Homme shows that he still has the touch. I recommend this cd to anyone who likes this style of music."
positive,"Great, but needs more music: The DVD starts out with footage from a vintage Pink Floyd concert fronted by (of course) Syd Barrett. That only lasts a few seconds, like most of the concert footage.This DVD is a documentary of the Syd Barrett years and a very entertaining one at that. It's well worth adding to your collection if you're a Floyd fan.The bonus features are interesting, but could have been much better. Concert footage (featuring entire songs, not snippets) from the early days of Floyd would have been perfect to add, and would make this DVD a 5-star masterpiece. I know there's footage of Syd & Floyd in concert performing Astronomy Domine - why not add that instead of cover versions of Barrett & Floyd songs?Oh well, it gets four stars anyhow. Very well done, despite the flaws."
negative,"VERY Old Fashioned Views of Men and Women and Homosexuality: While this book contains many helpful explanations of what to expect as your children grow it also contains WILDLY outdated depictions of men and women. Women are only described as working in the home - cleaning and baking. Men are described as working ceaselessly outside the home and having no time for children. The book was originally written in the 70s and it shows!In today's world where 70% of women work outside the home I found these depictions off-putting. I mean, wow, when I was a kid (and i'm 45) my mom worked outside the home.The greatest ding against the book though, is it's offensive depiction of homosexuality as a condition worthy of 'immediate psychological attention'. I am not gay, am married and have two children but if either of my sons are gay, I will support them and their choices with all my heart - not send them to a psychiatrist!"
negative,"I got it to work and still hated it.: I have a Nokia 5190 from Cingular and eagerly ordered this unit. Cingular charged me a flat rate of $... a month just for datalink service, and then minutes on top of that, but that's not too expensive for wireless internet access.I got it installed and running in about 45 minutes and proceeded to try it out. I got so annoyed with the speed, the bulky cable, the connect time (~30 to 40 seconds) and the intermittent service, that I gave up and returned it.Don't bother."
negative,"Awful: Video was a complete waste of time, absolutely zero substance, speaker talked about all of his winners, promoted web service. Save your money!"
positive,"Amazing: Although I am only 16, I spend much of my time reading and for the most part, I read only fantasy. This book has to be one of the best I've ever read - in my mind, although not as good as Tolkien, it has become one of my favorite books. I can hardly wait for the rest of the series to be released."
positive,"Jungle antics in two languages: Mischievous mice, crazy cats, and other audacious animals traipse through the Happy Jungle and fill it with laughter and wisdom. Bilingual adventures in Spanish and English you won't soon forget. Great for children of all ages!"
positive,"IZO- TCM BBBBBBUUUUUUUUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!: If you want to see a film that can scare you wihtout using gore this is the one.Tobe Hooper's low-budget horror is brill at the art of suprise with the weird but wonderful music with shocking close ups which believe me make you cringe in disgust.""Leatherface played by Gunner Hanson shows the darkness of the character showing that he is simple minded, almost a child trapped in a mans body.Which makes him an even bigger threat! The strong and realistic story is what really makes this movie a classic.The simple techniques of scare and lack of gore en-force this fact of a ""classic"".The showdown is eye-popping and keeps you glued the screen with in the final moments.(The 4 star is just simply for lack of blood.)P.S. Read my review for TCM 2."
positive,"A romantic comedy gem: Spunky with cheeky humour and wits, Trish Jensen's under-rated gem of a romantic comedy tells of two antagonizing attorneys, Paige Hart and Ross Bennett, who after a court session suffers a bomb blast and are hospitalized, diagnosed with Tibetan Concupiscence Virus that heightened sexual awareness. Their closed proximity forces them to deepen their understanding. Paige's large and comically larcenous extended family as well as a side romance between the doctor and Paige's brother provides first-rate entertainment while we are stuck with the oddball couple in their tension-filled and delightfully emotional romance. Trish Jensen delivers dimensional chracterization through punchy dialogues that are fresh, witty and funny."
positive,"I may not need new glasses!: I'm back here to order another Ott desk/task lamp. Baby Boomers of a certain age may need a more natural light to see and read - at least this Boomer does! It's sturdy but lightweight, is smartly designed, and I like all the ways the lamp light can be directed. It can light up a large area or a small space. I don't know if I'll hang one on a wall, but it can easily be done. I'm obviously sold on the product."
positive,"A good read: I think that this book is a very interesting book because it has some very interesting characters. For instance Mildred, I think that she is a very brainwashed characte. My favorite part in this book would have to be when Montag is outrunning society. I like it because it shows in great detail what Guy is feeling, and seeing."
negative,"no effect: after taking the product for 2 months, I can report absolutely no effect, either good or bad. Waste of my money."
negative,"Measure of a BOY!: What a disappointment. I love Clay's voice and was really excited about this CD release. His latest single, ""Invisable"" will disappear fast!... what a bad song. This CD certainly doesn't live up to the quality of material he is capable of singing. Sorry... I listened to this CD 8 or 9 times and it just didn't get any better. I sold it on E-bay."
positive,i already reviewed this when i got it but ok: same thing as i stated with Tsubasa 12 i already reviewed it when i got these two together so i don't really know why they are asking me to review it again.
positive,"Good ending: While the film got me wet, it could have used improvement. The plot could have been expressed in two lines of text and only functioned to serve up sex scenes. Which there were an endless string of. Starting with in minutes of the start when Femalien looks out her window and watches the neibors get it on in the backyard. The kink scene left me cold. Maybe the scene will seem kinky to a really Vanilla person, but hardly anyone else. The actors were so-so. They didn't look bored, but didn't seem to put much into their roles. Most of the acress were agmented and in one case had the profile that comes from a bad job of surgury. The main star had a wonderful face which reminded me of Jennifer Tilly. As a polyfiditous person I was pleased to see an ending that clearly indicated a ongoing triad."
negative,No Support: Ordered despite seeing reviews cautioning about poor documentation and situations where product does not work. Attempts to contact Apricorn via phone (800# on product for example) or email were waste of time.One review found via Google suggested a situation similar to my experience and possible solution/workaround. Cannot find the article again. Have to wonder why Apricorn cannot provide same info.The reviews noting poor support were correct.
negative,"Stop while you're ahead!: Save your money or purchase a hammer when you buy this cd because all you'll want to do is hit yourself in the head for buying it in the first place. If not for that then you'll be hitting yourself just so you don't have to hear this woman's whinney voice, trust me. I bought this album just a few days ago and all I can say is..Well, you get the point.."
positive,"Eragon; A Book For The Masses: I originally checked out this book from the local library for my 10 year old book worm. After we sat down to read the book we decided it was a must have and purchased it for our own library. Not only is it an enjoyable read, but we are both looking forward to reading the second book in the series."
negative,"So, so very bad: I had just finished reading ""The Autobiography of Henry VIII: With Notes By His Fool, Will Somers"" by Margaret George and was interested in learning more about about that time. A group of acquaintances heartily & gushingly recommended ""The Other Boleyn Girl"".Fortunately, my copy came from a thrift store, because I cannot finish it. I'm not even at page 75 yet and I'm seriously hating it. The most eye-rolling passage for me was Mary's description of her stay at her family's country estate all by herself (with the exception of the servants), and her discussions with local farmers, plus the story about how she secured seed for a crop for some of them. Please.If Ms. Gregory is the feminist she claims to be, she would do well to write more accurately about history and and less sensationally. The truth is usually much more interesting anyway.I'll be combing these 1 and 2 star reviews for recommendations of better accounts of the time and of Anne Boleyn."
negative,"Sucks: Well, I haven't seen it, but my beloved wife has got me hooked on the whole Avonlea etc and after buying the first two, I was ready to buy the third and last installment for her(me) for Valentines' Day.However, after reading all the reviews, I have NEVER seen such a broad consensus of the quality of a movie as 'The Continuing Story'. Perhaps that's because the first two are so moving, funny, and charming. As many reviewers have mentioned, they've been poisoned by a regrettably poor final installment to the series and would have rather ended it at Sequel 2. And that is how I plan to live the rest of my life. Without Sequel 3."
positive,Router Books: The Router Book has material and projects to make the experience of using the router satisfying and productive.
negative,"what a complete waste of time and money: I have no idea how it did in the theater, and further, I don't much care.Even with the acting potential of Terry Farrell (Star Trek, Deep Space Nine) and Parker Stevenson (Hardy Boys, Baywatch), this just plods along. A group of military criminals are given one last chance--go on a mission to occupy a space-outpost, held by enemy forces. Unfortunately, something is loose, and killing everyone nearby.The acting was wooden, everyone seems capable of two emotions--fear and anger. There are no light points, no comedic moments, no gentleness in the movie. There are no low moments that are necessary to the increase in tension. As a result, the tension never really gets going, and the entire movie falls flat.It's not really even worth one star, but Amazon.com has that as a minimum. I'm glad I rented it. I'd probably try to return it if I'd actually bought it."
negative,"Poor quality control: The first X-Acto pencil sharpener I purchased from Amazon was ""dead"" within 3 months of once-a-week use, sharpening about 25 pencils, 10 pencils at a time. The motor was dead. Sent it back to Amazon for replacement; no problem with being replaced. The replacement was defective on arrival (it had a loud metal-on-metal screech on the first use). It would still sharpen, despite the screech, and within a day the screech stopped. Now, six weeks later, it has bitten the dust. Can't send it back to Amazon for a replacement, according to their return policies, so I have to deal with the manufacturer. It does sharpen well when working, so I thought I would try one more time. This pencil sharpener has a two-year warranty."
positive,"okay for the price: I used it for a week and half and it seem to work as described. I don't know how well its going to work for over a long period of time, but it is cheap so it probably wouldn't last that long. No leakage of air or anything yet. It was the right size for me and I am 5'2, it might be small if your over 6' I'd imagine. Anyways, I recommend it to people who are looking for a temporary place to sleep."
negative,"Mindless exploitation: The people who made and starred in this film must have been slumming for a paycheck. How original- a nieve city girl decides to get away for a while in what looks like the inbred capital of the world, and is followed and eventually attacked by some real ugly rednecks. Don't be fooled into thinking this is something shocking or controversial like the cover would have you beleieve (banned everywhere, blah blah)it is just plain crap. If you want GOOD low-budget horror, go get Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dead Alive, etc. This is for people with no lives to fulfill their rape fantasies."
positive,"Tremors 2: Aftershocks: Okay, my wife thinks I am crazy but I really like the Tremors movies (I-IV) and the TV series as well. I purchased the DVD for Tremors II to upgrade from the VCR tape that I had watched numerous times. This is probably the best of the sequels to the original movie. Fred Ward does an excellent job recreating his character, but the actor in the role of the sidekick is a little lame (the only real downside to the entire movie). Of course, it would be hard to top Kevin Bacon who starred with Fred Ward in the first movie. If you like Tremors I, then this should be your next purchase."
negative,Chain saw: Bad movie.Dont spend your money on this one. The acting is real bad. Not written well and produce.Only a few good scary moments in this one.
positive,"Great Toy!: My son got this toy for a Christmas present and it kept him busy on the 16 hour drive home. Now that it is in his crib, he loves to kick it on and off a million times. He loves the buttons and it keeps him busy. It makes him feel powerful to be able to control it. If he wakes at night, he just plays a bit and goes back to sleep."
positive,"One of the greatest novels!: Maybe G.G. Marquez's style is a little bit confusing. Nonetheless, this novel is a lot less confusing in style than, let's say The Autumn of the Patriarch by the same writer or ""Christ versus Arizona"" by Camilo Jose Cela. Indeed, it's easy to get tangled in so many Jose Arcadios and Aurelianos, but this is really a great story. His finesse, the metaphors and symbols he uses, the images the paints, all those lonely souls that inhabit this book, even the absurd that is to be found in this book, all of them combine together and form something really great. Something that is worth your time."
positive,"The Greatest!: The Thompson Chain bible was recommended to me by a minister at my church. I purchased my first bonded leather one in 1999. Since then I have purchased many other study bibles and was not satisfied. I have concluded that this is the best study bible created. It is so nice to have the option of reading the bible text without a load of commentary being stuffed in your face. If you want a commentary, go buy one! The more I study the Bible, the less of man's opinion I want. This bible allows you to read and research any topic on your own using scripture only. I LOVE MY THOMPSON-CHAIN!Get the Genuine leather or a Calfskin because as a new Christian, you may not get the full use of the bible right away, however, as your thirst for God's precepts increases, this Bible will not disappoint. Kirkbride bibles are built very sturdy and the genuine leather will ensure that the bible lasts longer outside of a cover. This is the best Bible I own."
positive,"Better than expected: This tree was much sturdier than I expected...no tipping over easily! Too bad you require more words, I'm not a wordy person."
negative,Horrible narration: The narrator should have a European (french) accent. Instead he has a gravely American accent. It just does not fit the story at all. I was not happy with this purchase.
positive,"Missing 2.....: Love Billy. And this is probably the quintessential collection. Every song is a gem. Great sound. One thing. I owned the LP and cassette version of this and they omitted 2 songs on the cds. ""Fool That I Am"" and ""I'm Falling For You"". Strange. They're great songs. Granted there were more songs on the 2 cd set that weren't on the LP or cassette but.... would definitely recommend this. And if you can find the LP or cassette version buy that also so you can have those 2 songs. So far I have only found one of the songs on a cd and the sound wasn't as good."
negative,I wouldn't know if it's a good product: I ordered this back in June and as of November 13th I still haven't received it.
negative,"Mediocre - and that's being kind: As an avid fantasy reader, I was deeply disappointed by this book. I agree with others, that there was nothing new here, everything was borrowed (stolen?) from other writers. As far as the sequel, I'll skip it. There are too many good books out there for me to waste my time reading more of this."
positive,"This feature is ESPECTACULAR!!!....: You don't have to talk too much about this movie, everybody knows that it was one of the greatest superproduction of all times, the actors, the sites, the pictures, all this things makes it unic...The feature of the DVD is great!, 3 dvds to enjoy a lot of extras...You can't have an epic collection without this dvd..."
positive,"climbing block: the climbing block is the one accessory I would recommend to anyone buying an indoor trainer. It stabilizes your front wheel for those really intense workouts and the height of one is just enough to add a little something to your workout. My only dislike is that I wish the three grooves were differing heights, but then this is also a stackable item so I should stop being cheap and buy another one if I want more height."
negative,"Not very happy with product: I really wouldn't recommend this product. They say the bottoms are plastic coated, but I didn't find that. I ended up having to use a liner with it which didn't work at all. The cats used it, but missed more often than not, and it ended up being much more difficult to use than just a small plastic litter box would have been for about the same price."
positive,"Couldn't ax for more: Hi. My name is Steve. I come from a rough area. I used to be additted to creck.Office Space is a veritable classic. The commentary and interviews in the special features are hilarious and informative.If you know what's good for you, check this out. It will not make you want to throw your TV in the middle of a field and smash it with a baseball bat."
positive,"A bit uncomfortable...: I had to exchange the size but the small is still _really small_. It gives me a nice shape but I should probably be wearing a medium. I am a size 6 with a belly left over from a 25 pound weight loss. It's tedious to put on and I'm exhausted when I finally get that last hook hooked! There has to be an easier way! The back support you get is awesome but sitting in it can get uncomfortable after a while. I recommend wearing it over a light weight tank of some kind. The material used irritated my skin a little bit and it made me sweat a little. Should you buy it? If you are tolerant of the ins and outs, then go for it. It was inexpensive."
positive,pete seegar's greatest hits: Pete Seegar's Greatest hits.Very good. Brings back many memories of earlier days. If you have joan baez and pete seegar you have the best
positive,"Sturdy Bench: I am 6'1"". This bench is a very good fit. It feels sturdy and stable when lifting. There is a good span between the uprights to ensure your hands don't hit when replacing the bar. It was easy to assemble. I have decided to remove the leg lift, but it was not in the way. The padding is comfortable and seems durable. I would definitely recommend this bench for a daily workout."
positive,"Excellent how-to book on training your retriever: After reading this book, I felt like I was an expert on the how-to's of training retrievers. I have tried out many of these training techniques with my dog and have had fabulous success. And I could swear that my dog has spoken a word or two after several training sessions! I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in having a well-disciplined dog. A brilliant piece of work!"
negative,No sure if satisfied yet: Wrote to ask if movie was in italian or english...opened to see after no reply..will not play in our DVD so going to try a brand new one my daughter has. If works and is in English we will keep it. If it in Italian or it does not work in their dvd we will be sending it back.Stewart Schofield
positive,"WOW! A MUST HAVE!: This album is incredible! It has been too, too long since an album has been made that is packed with all #1 hits. Clay Aiken's Measure of a Man will revolutionize the music industry. His pure, amazing voice is brethtaking. This album is a definite MUST for all Music Lovers of all ages."
negative,"Misleading Description on DVD & Disney Site: Don't be misled by the DVD description or the description on the Disney website.This is NOT a movie!This is 3 separate episodes that have been shown on TV over and over:The Treasure Behind The Little Red Door, Super Fast, and The Great Sky Race RematchThe descriptions do not tell you this, they lead you to believe it's one long episode/movie...my kids were sooo excited! BIG disappointment because they'd seen all the episodes so many times on TV...nothing new at all.These DVD ""movies"" are actually episode collections - don't be misled!"
negative,"Great--until it died: I purchased this item with a hi-res camera, and it was a lifesaver on long shoots. The ability to back up my images immediately gave me real peace of mind, and the thing really worked as advertised. Although it would freeze every now and then, I never lost any images--the only drawback was that you had to remove the battery to restart it, as it stopped responding to all button inputs.This morining, as I was preparing for a 5-day shoot, I turned it on to delete any old images and recharge it, and the screen was completely dead. Plugged into my PC via USB, it all still shows up, but I was totally depending on it for this upcoming weekend, and I have been totally let down. I have no choice but to try to navigate it in the dark, unless they want to overnight one to my hotel."
negative,"Doesn't fit!: The bolt holes don't line up. They are skewed. The paint on it was not complete, there were bare metal spots on it."
negative,David Caruso films: I am a huge fan of David Caruso and looked forward to seeing this film - it seemed to offer something different and enjoyable - What a disappointment!Almost 90% of the film seems to have been shot in the dark or half light making it very difficult to really see what is happening - I suppose it would be alright for a young person with 20/20 vision but it didn't suit me. I have put it in my pile of DVD's to go to the charity shop!
positive,"Enjoyable novel: This was the first Xanth novel I ever read, but it was easy enough to get into. I wasn't too confused by reference to other Xanth novels as they were minimal and were not much focused on. Some of the jokes were rather funny, and the plot had enough humorous twists in it (and a couple of cool surprises!) to keep me well-entertained. It was a rather enjoyable book, though I definitely like Incarnations of Immortality better. overall 3.5/5 stars."
positive,"MADE FOR THIS: This is a brilliant Cd,it is as if this music was made just for Marty Robbins,great tracks,if you like songs from Cowboy films,easy to listen to or sing along with this"
negative,"Made me sorry to have the gift of sight.: I had to read this for a book club, and a fifth of the way into it, I began to wish I were blind, so I wouldn't have to continue. I considered gouging my eyes out with a grapefruit spoon. And if someone tried to read aloud it to me, I was prepared to pour hot parrafin into my ears. And if Anne Sullivan tried to sign ""Moll Flanders"" into my hand, I would dig into my wrists and sever the nerves to my hand with a carpet knife. Then if someone tried to tap the text of this book onto my back using Morse Code, I would be left with no course of action other than suicide. As it was, I completed my book club obligation, and as soon as we're done discussing this, I'm going to bandsaw open my cranium, locate the part of the brain that remembers I read this book, and scoop it out with a melonballer. Wish me luck!"
negative,"Awful: Wow, how bad does it get.It was a chore to read this book. It contains the most unlikely and implausible plot. The characters seemed to be conjured up and very unreal. Not interesting, not funny, not entertaining and it was really hard work to get through it.I droppped my copy in the trash bin when I finished reading it. There is no way I could ever read it again and I wouldn't want to inflict it on anyone else.I've never felt this way about any other book. It was awful."
positive,"How It All Started: It had to be God's Providence. Bill Gaither and the members of the Vocal Band at that time invited a few friends and mentors to join them in the Gaither's studio to record ""Where Could I Go."" But ""it just so happened"" that the cameras kept rolling when the song was finished. What we see after that are the testimonies and prayers that these Christian friends share and the spontaneous songs and harmonies that flowed from their stories. This video deserves much more than the tag ""collector's item."" Rather, it captures the spirit of Southern Gospel music. When I saw this for the first time almost 20 years ago I smiled and cried as I sang along. I grew up with these voices in my head, their songs part of my spiritual heritage. It was like...coming home."
negative,"Shoddy piece of work, notable only for the presence of Gwynne: Anne Gwynne was one of those Hollywood supporting players who appeared in a lot of movies, but was seldom recognized. She normally ended up playing romantic leads in B-movies - often a weak person, but with a feisty streak in her that made her too hot to handle for her insipid male co-stars. Made later on in her career, TEENAGE MONSTER has very little to recommend it, except as a poor imitation of I WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN. Gwynne tries her best as a parent, but has little to work with."
negative,Boo Hoo: I bought this cd because I Am fan of fifteen even though some of the lyrics are kind of whinny hippy crap.However this one just goes to far the song white pride almost made me puke.I threw my copy in the garbage so no one would have to here it.
negative,"""O Brother"" Fans Beware!: Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack. If you're looking for the genuine article, this is it.However, as is common with recordings this old, many of the originals were made by semi-professionals with primitive recording technology. As a result, these ""originals"" do not have the clarity, the warmth, or the production values of the masterful performances on ""O Brother"" and the companion live album ""Down from the Mountain."" If you're looking for music that sounds like those two albums, try Gillian Welch's ""Revival"" instead."
positive,"A page-turner with ALOT of details on human putrefaction: I got hooked on the storyline despite the repellant descriptions of decaying bodies and maggots. Kept wondering what the main character, Tempe Brennan, looked like. No description ever given. All the loose ends were tied up at the end, except how Ryan knew about Brennan's mugging. A recommended alternative to Patricia Cromwell's Kay Scarpetta, whose plots and charaterizations are getting weaker and weaker."
negative,"Dull As Dishwater: This album has got to be the most boring, unimaginative CD of the year. All of these five-star reviews are very misleading. I feel that most of them have been written by obsessed Clay fans who feel the need to heap praise on Measure Of A Man simply because ""It's Clay!!!"" Don't be misled! I wouldn't recommend buying this record for anyone as Christmas gift, unless you are trying to make an enemy. A better gift idea would be Speakerboxxx/The Love Below by Outkast, or Elephant by The White Stripes. Merry Un-Clay Christmas!"
negative,"7th Day Adventist Proselytizing: I bought this for a friend fighting breast cancer, and hesitated to even give it to her after flipping through it. This book is almost written stream of consciousness style, and is basically propaganda. The recipes are full of Worthington meat substitutes, which I doubt are very healthy."
negative,"Useful 50 years ago: But few of the ideas are practical in today's world. I suppose if you lived on a homestead with few amenities you might be able to glean some usefulness from this book. But as a modern dweller, I was disappointed."
positive,"THIS HAS IT ALL- GREAT PIECE OF WORK!: Action, suspense, politics, social commentary, great writing, great characters, great acting- there's nothing to dislike here.Any recounting of the plot would spoil the pleasures of watching it all unfold for the first time. And the pleasures hold up on repeated viweings- I've watched this 4 times in the last year.I highly recommend this DVD- and though I've not seen the truncated and Americanized remake, I know it can't compare to the original. So watch this one!"
negative,"A little plastic with your coffee?: This is my third Keurig and I've always been a big fan. But there seems to be a problem with these new ones. The water that comes through this machine smells and tastes like burnt plastic, therefore the coffee is AWFUL and undrinkable.Search the web and you'll see all of the discussions on how to get rid of the plastic taste. But in the end, why should I have to de-scale a new the machine, and where is the smell/taste coming from? My other concern is that even if I run enough water through this thing to get rid of the taste, will there be residual plastic coming through in every cup, and is this healthy?I think this thing is going back."
negative,"This book was dull, boring had a slow: This book was dull, boring, had a slow start but had a thrilling ending"
positive,ilovelucy: First off i love rosie she is the best...i have all her cookbooks and they truely are my bibles for cooking and baking...I use the Pie and Pastry cookbook all the time ..And everyone loves my pies and the butter pie crust is to dye for...I have maded alot of the pies and they all have come out great .....so if you are looking for the prefect pies and crust this is your book...
positive,SUPER EASY TO SET UP!: I was live within about 5 minutes after I plugged it in. Super easy setup with my Tivo Series 2.
negative,"Cheap replacement but not really a replacement: I bought these to replace my 2-way fuel valves in my 1966-1977 Early Ford Bronco.First, these valves are cheap Chinese versions of an old American design that you can still buy through Parker Hanfin. I only learned this after I bought them.Second - these valves DO NOT replace the old style American valves because the common port should come out the bottom - not on the side as these are.Third - On the old American version the handle turns 180 deg to switch tank feeds. These DO NOT - they only turn 90 deg.Fourth - the Chinese design took some short cuts and the parts ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE so that means what I bought is useless to me.NOT RECOMMENDED if you want a quality replacement for an old American Design that you can still buy from an American manufacturer."
positive,"Important and timeless: In short: An amazing and timeless book, still as wonderful today as it was when first published. Everyone should read this book."
negative,"Will not be purchasing another one of these: It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed."
positive,"great buy!: Yes the clip is firm and needs a little effort to open, but not enough to give it a bad review in my opinion. No, not for weak hands. Nice quality. Holds coins well. More compact than I thought. Can be used for keys, earbuds or what ever. Made well. sturdy. I bought 2 more!"
negative,"A Career Minor Leaguer?: Being partial to the Red Sox, and catchers, I thought this might be the one. The book has a promising start as Casey Fox and his Boswell Russ first cross paths at a college baseball game, and it continues to fulfill the potential for quite some time but ultimately sputters out, like a minor leaguer who gets hung up at the AA level. There is much to like, including the exploration of the Red Sox conundrum and the state of the Game, but it unfortunately veers into the pedantic. Two of the main characters are drawn well enough to hold the reader's interest, but the female lead is flat, a disappointment."
negative,Broke after the first ride.: These rollers broke on the first ride. The rear roller would continue to slip against the frame after the initial break. I'm 170 lbs cyclist and did not these hard. I could not recommend them.
positive,"Best Tuner on the Market next to Peterson: This tuner is phenomenal. With its varying degrees of sensitivity, its historical temperaments and its sound production, this is hands down the best tuner I've ever used as an orchestral musician."
negative,Only so I could see the movie: I bought the book when the movie first came out. I always promise myself that I will try to read a book before I see the movie if I think it will be worth the effort. The book did make me want to take a cooking class and definitely made me laugh a few times but I think it was a little long. I was getting tired of the author at the end with her bitching. I would love to read her newspaper articles since those would be short and sweet and perfectly suited for her writing. Do NOT bother seeing the movie!
negative,"Masterpiece spoiled by awful subtitles: The cast and production are splendid. The subtitles are an abomination. They often make no sense whatsoever. How the director could have allowed his excellent work to be marred in this way is beyond me. With proper subtitles, this should be a best seller."
positive,"I ain't never heard nuthin like this before.: When I first heard the Shaggs about 10 years ago, I couldn't stop laughing, especially to the instrumental beginning of ""My Pal Foot-Foot."" Beyond hearing Mrs. Miller, this is the funniest stuff I've ever heard. But this stuff is on a different level, I am just not sure what level. I have discovered there is real talent as there is its own structure, but for the life of me I don't know what kind of talent. Does this have something to do with living in New Hampshire? Believe me, you'll never hear anything like this again in your life-but the truth is I wouldn't want to be without this album. I like what was quoted on the back side of the CD, ""They bring my mind to a complete halt."" Here's to the Wiggin Sisters!"
negative,Waste of time: Did not like this movie at all. I didnot finish watching it because it did not have the usual characters that we had grown accustomed to. The movie was boring and did not have any merit whatsoever. This was a total waste of movie time.
positive,"truly unbelievable: I'd give this 10 stars if I could. What a beautiful CD, especially the title track."
negative,"Pure junk: My office received four units. All units failed at the first power outage. The APC units worked fine, as usual.The Tripp Lite battery back up is a complete waste of money. You are better off connecting directly to the outlet and saving your money. If that is not an option (likely the case) buy an APC. If the price is 2x or 3x that of the Tripp Lite, there is a reason why."
negative,"A piece of classic [junk]: This book [stunk] beyond all belief! It was already bad enough that the March sister were extreamly good (too good)and how they complained about stupid stuff, like noses and how they were poor (which doesn't even make sense if you have a servant and a manor!)but she killed of Beth so early in the series and Jo didn't even marry Laurie!! But instead married her sister IT'S NOT SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN LIKE THAT!!! It makes me wonder what could possibly fill the pages of the other two books. So I DO NOT recommend this book to ANYONE! Instead, try Harry Potter :)"
negative,"Sound Clips Will Do: The hipsters can praise this all they want, but they KNOW it's crap and praising it just helps in their desperate desire to feel so smug and superior to mere mortals. I can guarantee you that few of them actually own a Shaggs album and of those that do few ever listen to it. This applied to Zappa too.Sure, it has a sincerity missing in so much of today's music, but sincerity alone does not make music (and I use the term loosely) listenable. Intrigued by this band's story? That's understanding, it is a fascinating one. But if you still feel a need to hear this stuff save yourself a lot of dough and go with the sound clips. They'll tell you everything you need to know."
negative,?: I have been taking other brands of Magnesium and they work pretty good. This one stinks. Doesnt do a thing for me. Would request a refund but takes to long.
positive,"The best of Paul's under-rated albums: BACK TO THE EGG may not be one of melody master Paul McCartney's best albums but it is his most under-rated. If ""Who Are You"" was Pete Townsend's response to late-70s punk rockers who thought they were taking over, then high-energy BACK TO THE EGG songs like ""To You,"" ""Old Siam Sir,"" ""Spin It On,"" ""So Glad To See You Here"" and ""Getting Closer"" comprised Paul McCartney's answer. Right on, Paul! BACK TO THE EGG's CD bonus tracks include the great flip-side ""Daytime Nighttime Suffering"" and the now-holiday standard, ""Wonderful Christmas Time,"" adding value. Get BACK TO THE EGG, get BACK TO THE EGG, get BACK TO THE EGG to where it should belong - your stereo."
negative,"Don't be cheated: I bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews. Dont mean to be rude, but people who gave these shirts probably haven't wore a decent dress shirt. You can frequently get 'good' $45 shirt for $10 in malls when on sale. I thought this was a better deal. But boy oh boy, I can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store. I had ordered these as a gift, but now will give them to Red Cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion, or even for daily use (except maybe when you are working at Septic tanks or something). These are from Bangladesh, and I can assure you, they are not much better than what would be sold for $0.50 in BGD. If you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere, DO NOT BUY THESE SHIRTS."
positive,"Nice one - primarily white floral: I don't find Pure to be very green but it is floral. It opens with a white floral POW!, likely the lily & freesia combination, but it quickly mellows into a soft, soapy floral. JB78 review is spot-on with his review of Pure as a sheer floral that's marine fresh. Pure was launched about the time as Happy & Pleasures, but I find Pure to be more likable nearly 15 years after launch.Pure is one of those fragrances that is easy to put on & easy to wear. Clean & feminine. Something to wear when you don't know what to wear. Everyone should have a perfume like that in their wardrobe - this is mine."
negative,"Shipping no longer a problem: Great Diapers.As of December 2004--Shipping is no longer a problem. Ships out within a couple of days, and received with in ten. Free shipping. Gotta love that.Give 5 stars, but unable to edit the stars--only the review."
positive,"Entertaining: Phillippa Gregory is one of my favourite authors when it comes to historical fiction, and she lived up to my expectations in this book too, I didnt know much about Henry VIII and the tudor period before I read this book, and I feel like I got a bigger knowledge now about that time. I like when books can make me feel something like happiness, anger, sadness etc. and this book managed to do that."
negative,"oil??: even though is not oil, it feels like it. that might be good to an extent, but if you can't wash it off with water, i don't think you want it inside you."
negative,"Terrible product, I regret spending my money on this: I bought this air mattress two months ago. I used a couple of days and it worked fine. Now a friend is planning to visit so I decided to use it again but something went wrong, instead of a flat surface, there is a huge bump in the middle that would make sleeping on it uncomfortable if not impossible.Since this is a product you will use only a couple of days before putting it away until you need it again, the amazon returning period will be over by the time you actually try it and find something wrong with it. And the company that makes this mattress says ""this product does not have any warranty or service program"". I hope I can put this in the recyclables bin!I wish I would've spend a little bit money on a real mattress that won`t fail after a while."
negative,Don't Buy it!: This product has a major default. It is badly designed and breaks very easily at the plastic arms holding the adjustable metal railings above the phones due to a design flaw. This is the second pair that bose replaced for me and they are broke again!!!
negative,"Great Book. Bad copy of the book.: I hate to rate a Burroughs book so low. I've been a fan of his works for a very long time. However, this version of the book is incomplete. The previous reviewer stated the book jumped right into the action with no back story. That is because this version is missing the first several pages. I happened to have two versions on my Droid Kindle app. and accidentally switched to this version after starting the other. The other version is the complete Mucker trillogy for $0.99. Well worth the price for three very good books.If you want free, this version of the book will stand on it's own minus the back story, but if the back story is important to you, get the full version."
positive,"The Perfect Suitcase: This is the highest quality and best-looking suitcase I've ever owned! It's sturdy and thoughtfully designed. In my opinion, it's also beautiful (we got the green color). I know that another reviewer said she uses it for 3-day trips, but I find it works well for trips up to 2 weeks. And I'm not that light of a packer! It is carry-on size, but only domestically (in the U.S.). Also, I've been hassled by hypervigilant U.S. airline staff who have insisted that I prove it actually is carry-on size by placing it in that metal-box-tester-thingy. I do have to admit that it looks too big to fit, but it always does!"
positive,"Yes: This was my intro to Caetano beyond David Byrne's Brazilian music compilations.This is beautiful, mellow, progressive music in Spanish."
negative,"Warning - missleading title: Even this CD is called ""New year's concert 2000 in Vienna"" it is NOT the popular ""New year's concert"" which can be seen all over the world. The real thing is the ""Vienna Philharmonic: New year's concert 2000"" under Riccardo Muti (conductor).I felt upset getting the wrong CD and had to replace it. This just extended to period of waiting for the pleasure of the real ""Neujahrskonzert""."
positive,"Great as a travel Bible: The quality of this handy bible is actually pretty good, although I only use it for travel. I would not recommend it as your everyday reader or research Bilbe. The pages are very thin, and not as bright as a quality Bible such as that produced by Oxford Press. The font is very readable and it's turning out to be a fantastic travel companion."
positive,"This book changed the way I look at all books.: Guy Montag is a fireman who job it is to start fires instead of stoping the. In this backwards world of his he burns books and the houses that they are hidden in. In this future world reading a book is against the law because it gives peoples ideas. Guy never qustioned his job until he actually thinks what it would be like to read a book.....I never never really thought what our world would be like with no books, but now that I think about it I can't believe how monotonous and boring it would be. Now that I think about it I am glad I dont live in a world like Guy Montag's.This book has become on of my favorites and I highly recomend you read it!"
positive,"Billie at her very best: ""Solitude"" is a stunningly good album - warm, intimate singing from one of the premier jazz stylists, accompanied by steller jazzmen. It was Billie Holiday's first Verve album, and she is in fine voice - her slightly tangy timbre is well-captured by the Verve engineers, and she improvises with all her usual taste and subtlety. The songs, too, are great: many of them are poignant and a little melancholy, which creates a sustained mood of intimacy and worldliness. You simply will not hear a more convincing reading of Cole Porter's ""Easy to Love"" than here: it's a very hard song to get right, with its demanding intervals and sophisticated lyrics, but Holiday somehow manages to reshape the melody in her own style which mining a deep vein of understated passion. It's a wonderful example of her art."
positive,"My Favorite, Of All Time: I think that this book is wonderful. The mixture of fansasy and a little truth made this book irresistable to me. I think that it is imaginative, and made me almost believe this wonderful story. I have read many books, but I love this one above the others and can't wait for the second!"
positive,"Just as good as any diaper: After 5 kids, we used all kinds of diapers. While some store brands were less than expected, Pampers, Huggies, and Luvs were the ones that performed the best. As long as it holds in what it's supposed to hold in, I could care less what they looked like!"
negative,"Quality control is an issue: The first one of these sharpeners that I bought worked wonderfully. The only complaint I could make about it was that the shavings tray is very small, and if it got overfilled it was very difficult to pull out and could break.But when it came time to replace it, my second one's blades were clearly off center, because no pencil would sharpen evenly. The whole unit would shake and rattle too. So I returned it. The third one also had a similar off-center problem, and to make matters worse, as soon as I inserted a pencil it would never shut off again until I unplugged it.After that, I gave up and went with another brand."
positive,Brilliant: All I can say is that Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward should be very proud. THIS IS A MUST HAVE MOVIE It has been my favourite movie for 3 years!
negative,"NO: THIS IS CRAP!: DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT ANYBODY SAYS! This album is such a letdown after the first. Even their b-sides are better than this! Ugh! This is the perfect example of a band that reahces their haitus, and figures no matter what they do people will buy into it any way, so they make a horrible album. This album is like Nonpoints Development letdown after their groundbreaking Statement. Bad stuff. Keep away from this cliche trendy little cop-out band."
positive,"C'est excellent: I picked this book up at random and immediately it appealed to me, cosidering I like reading about the wives of kings in Europe, and Henry VIII's wives are no exceptions. I have read many novels dealing with his wives, and this one, The Other Boleyn Girl is one of the best. It was, for me, a quick read and intriguing. I find it well-written for the most part. Though primarily fiction, much of it is truth and conincides with the facts that I know.I highly reccomend this to anyone who is a fan of the author, Philippa Gregory, with this being one of her better novels and of historical fiction as well. Highly reccomended to anyone else who has an intrest in the wives of the kings of Europe and Henry VIII especially."
positive,"WONDERFUL!!!: These are absolutely the BEST pair of binoculars we've ever had! We love the fact that you can adjust both eyes for clarity, not just one eye as with most others. We can't say enough about this great product. We shopped locally to find what we wanted, then went on Amazon to find a much better price. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."
positive,"Luther was Anti-Catholic: First off - anyone who has stuidied church history (no, I'm not referring to the revisionist garbage being promulgated) knows that Martin Luther, was Anti-catholic. He started out as Catholic monk, who discovered for himself, that salvation is NOT through the Roman Catholic Church, Mary, the Pope, good deeds, etc...rather, through placing one's faith in what Jesus Christ did for us on the cross. This is what marked Luther as a ""heretic"" to the Roman church. Sadly and ironically, our society sees and ""lumps"" all of Christianity into a ""Catholic"" wrapping. Catholocism never has, and never will be Christianity."
positive,I love the special effects!: The special effects in this one are just as good as the first! I think the story line is even a little better. Looking forward to Spiderman 3.
negative,Really Stupid DVD: This was really bad. I had to turn it off before getting to the end. It is a home video quality production showing many stupid business decisions. I can't believe that myself or anyone else would be willing to pay to watch this.
negative,"This book stinks: All Paolini did was take characters, events and ideas from Tolkien, McCaffery and many other major fantasy writers (thank goodness he didn't get his hands on Cooper), throw them in the blender and spit them out through his own playdo mold. The story smells like he's sprayed the whole thing with Tolkien perfume. All that would be acceptable if the kid could write. Being 18 years old myself, i am in a position to criticize. He doesn't go deeper than the surface on any of his characters or invesitgate their motives from more than one angle. His entire writing style is flat and childish. The words themselves are not intersting to read. As Stephen King said, they call is prose for a reason. People need to stop praising him just becuase he is a nineteen year old. Get real. This book stinks!"
positive,"Great Printer!!: Great deal, great delivery, great packaging, great printer! Reviews were all correct - this is truly a fast printer. I have been using an older, much larger HP laser printer but needed a smaller one. This printer is even faster. This is one of my better buys - it truly is worth the money - and more!"
positive,Pacific Fun Tube: My grandchildren love this tunnel and played with it all evening when we exchanged gifts. It appears to be durable. It's easy to store since it folds flat.
negative,THE WORST CD EVER: I CANT BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HATE THIS CD.USHER NEED TO PUT THE MIC DOWN AND NOW.THE SONGS HAVE NO MEANING.AND YOU CANT UNDERSTAND A WORD HE SAYS.HERES ALLITTLE ADVICE TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BUY THIS ALBUM: DONT BUY IT!SAVE YOUR MONEY!
negative,"This Is Without A Doubt The Worst Band I've EVER Heard!!: I can only imagine two things: either this singer is mocking retarded people (because he sounds like one), or this is Kermit The Frog singing with his nads being squeezed so tight he's a soprano! I think the kids in Hanson sang better than this-didn't they???? lol. Anyone who takes this band seriously should be locked in a room with Michael Jackson for a month: showers not included. On the other hand, this band is so funny to listen to, you might want a copy to keep around for when your friends are over and you're partying: this could have EVRERYONE on the floor rolling in laughter by midnight! Big Zero waste of time and money ... A 10 ZERO RATING."
negative,"Nauseating: In a phrase: as nauseating as the ""artwork"" which besmirches its cover. This book is definitely not worth the price. Donate the money instead to your city's homeless instead! You will learn as much about AI by doing so and will actually contribute something to the world. Of course, the cover makes a great prank at cocktail parties. Place it under someone's drink and it will look like the beverage has been spilled.Winston's book is not only disorganized, but pretentious. He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer. Winston and his books will go down in history with the works of others, such as Doug Lenat, who made their fame primarily by doing something very easy before anyone else got around to doing it.Real AI is yet to come."
positive,"A romantic zen baseball comedy: When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about ""BY THE SEA"". This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner. As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players. With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!"
positive,Useful Material: This is a very good book with useful tips. I tried baking my pie on the floor of the oven like she suggests. The first time it turned out amazing. Every time since it has burned. Anyone have ideas why this happened? I have tried reducing the temperature and the crust comes out nice and golden but seems a little tougher to me.
positive,"Has its moments.: Prime is a cute movie but not the best movie I've seen. Uma Thurman is great as newly-divorced Rafi who meets and quickly falls for a 23-year old artist named David. Rafi sees a psychriatrist who turns out to be David's mother. Meryl Streep plays the psychriatrist, I like Meryl but I did not care for her in this particular role (see Kramer vs. Kramer and Bridges of Madison County instead), she is not at her best in comedy, she is brilliant in dramas, that's what makes her special and unique. The ending through me for a loop but I think as a whole this film works and it's worth a viewing or two. This movie is sweet and romantic but not much laughs for this one, you be the judge."
negative,Better use a map: We took the GPS to Germany and Italy and we ended up buying a map. the GPS had NO reception 90% of the time and one of the roads it suggested taking (after we set it on fastest way) once it did work ended up taking 1 hour longer than the rout we found on the map. Over all it was a very BAD experience especially since this is one of the most expensive ones on the market. Maybe it works better in the US.
positive,"Whoever doesn't like this movie; something is wrong with you.: The title says it all. This is one great movie, if you're thinking of purchasing it, I HIGHLY recommend it."
negative,burned up after touching it with my hand: purchased two of these. one unit worked good for about an hour the static electricity made it go up in flames. the second unit will only produce sound from the left or right channel at different levels. it will not balance out even with the balance nob.
positive,"Enya Amarantine CD: I'm very pleased, not only with the price for the ""slightly used/not new"" CD but for the voice quality and sound of this Enya CD."
positive,"Incredible - but it isn't Farscape: If by fast-paced you mean a Star Trek novel you can read in a couple of hours, no this isn't fast-paced. This is rich, challenging stuff, but you'll remember it for a long long time (and you'll be able to watch the David Lynch movie and know what the hell is going on)."
negative,"Bad Movie: This was the worst Harry Potter movie out of the five. It was also my second favorite Potter book (the seventh was the best) and that made the movie more disappointing. They left out so many good parts from the book, and the parts they left in where messed with. I would not buy this if I where you, if you want to buy a Potter movie, buy the third, that was the best one!"
positive,"I love this Book: I really enjoyed this book, she risked everything to help someone she barely knew, and whom she was supposed to hate! It was beautiful what she did, and deserves to be called a classic. I have it on tape too and thats really good also. Read it!"
negative,"there is no way i am paying $17 for the kindle edition of this book: are the publishers crazy? i was hoping to pick up the kindle editions of at least the first 3 in this series to reread on a long train trip later this year, but i am not understanding what makes this '40th anniversary edition' so special that it should cost 3x as much as any other book on my kindle. pass."
negative,"Cinematic satire is dead: Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se, it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best, but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps, like the American Presidency, lobby money can buy anything."
positive,Amazing!: If you enjoy Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey you need to read this fabulous book!
negative,"Meh.: If you've read any fantasy at all, this book will put you to sleep. Imagine all the big stories in the genre combined into one book without a bit of the craft or individual voice that sets a good, if average, fantasy novel apart."
negative,"NOT THAT GREAT: This book came highly recommended and...I don't understand why. Maybe because people like really lame crap? Well, this was that. Really lame story. Really dumb ending.The story is a ripoff of the Watchmen. It's Watchmen-Lite featuring Superman. If anyone were to say it wasn't, well they're deluding themselves. The Dr. Light rape scene was just really juvenile and stupid. I get it. Watchmen had a rape. Therefore if you're ripping off Watchmen you need some guy in a stupid white hat to rape somebody. Make's so much sense!Meltzer is good at writing narration. He makes the characters almost believable. If only this story wasn't so awful.And the huge anime eyes were just too much.Overrated crap. Hype to sell comics. Garbage. There, I said it. It's not one-star bad, but it's definitely two-star bad.And puh-lease, spare me Joss Whedon telling me how great this is. One complete hack congratulating another complete hack. BOOOOOO."
positive,"Benchmark book on a relatively young discipline of CI/BI: This is the most professional collection of articles on competitive intelligence I know of, with a good mix of both technical intelligence and foreign intelligence information. The Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP)has grown from 2,000 members in 1992 to 6,000 in 1999, and it's journal as well as its conferences, set the industry standard. A relatively low standard, but the standard never-the-less."
negative,"Dont Give them your credit card: I bought a 1 yr subscription to Hot Rod Magazine last year and they just charged it again for this year without my consent or permission. I don't know about you but when I pay for a yr with my credit card its not meant to be an annuity. Maybe they have some hidden fine print that makes this ""legal"" and maybe they don't. Totally unethical behavior in my opinion. Like the mag but I will not be doing business with these people in the future."
positive,"Irony and wisdom at its finest way: The story is an ode to optimism, in spite of all. Is everything that happens in this world for the best? This is the main philosophical question addressed in this book, and Candide will try to prove you that."
negative,huge: for no apparent reason these are humongous. my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous!
positive,"love this movie: love this movie glad i got the dvd and blu-ray not everybody has blu-ray so if they want to borrow it, we are good to go"
negative,Neither good or scary: An-ill prepared amateur pilot flys with a bunch of wackos. The result is predictable except for the supernatural twist (a hairy octopus flying in the air and supposedly causing trouble with the weather!?). Boring.
positive,"Handy, or better yet heady flashlight.: If you want your hands to be free, use your head. When I crawl under a desk to connect a computer, now I can see what I am doing and use the glowing screen on my cell phone to make calls and not cast a blue haze on the cables. Works well when I am in the wiring closet (by myself) now I have light were I need it and two hands free."
positive,"Top 10 Country Album of All Time: I primarily listen to Metal and Punk rock, but have a vested, deep love affair with older country legends (Cash, Jennings, Horton, Williams, Parton, Rogers, etc.) and if I could only have 1 album of my country collection, this would probably be it. If you don't like this as a country fan, you're absolutely nuts. The stories told, the voice that's singing, the no flash/frills honest musicianship is, in my mind as a musician, what all artists of all genres aspire to. My only very minimal gripe is the inclusion of ""El Paso"" which is just one of those songs EVERYBODY covers and I'm kinda worn out on, but his version is good regardless. If you like ballads, whether sung by Johnny Cash, Bon Jovi, or Dimmu Borgir, the song ""Big Iron"" is something you should own this album for on it's own merit. Buy now. You arent cool if you don't own this album."
negative,"handle breaks off: The handle broke off the top within the first three weeks of light usage. Otherwise, it's an ok basket. Nothing special."
negative,"Waste Of Money: Followed the instructions just like it said. My pictured all came out in a pinkish-red, had tothrow the cartdridge away. A big waste of time and money. I wont buy it again."
positive,"Why only one recording?s: I was first introduced to this by an arobics instructor that knew I liked diverse music. She was right on target. I have a community radio show, in Lincoln, NE, that allows me play a pretty full range of material. This was a good fit since I don't normally stray in this direction. It has met with keen interest from my listening audience. Jazz/funk adds balance to my show. My only question is ""Will there be a next offering?""This CD is well worth adding to your collection."
negative,DOESNT WORK: Tried to watch it on both my xbox360 and dvd player to find that its some cheap copy that wont even work. Very disappointed.
negative,"An Ever expanding story followed by same ol same ol: Very disappointing read. Starts with her tale of what she saw in 1963 then devolves into another ""MASSIVE GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY"" work. Offering no documentation to support statements made. Unsupported statements about what her boyfriend said, claimed or saw. Lauds Garrison and his persecution of an innocent man in New Orleans. Originally I thought &#65533;The Assassination tapes&#65533; By George O&#65533;Toole was the worst effort in Conspiracy volumes but no more."
positive,"It warmed my heart...: I really enjoyed this movie. It truly warmed my heart to see the values and struggles of the black family brought to the big-screen in such an endearing way. In fact, I think you'll see how much the actors and actresses enjoyed their roles. What marvellous performances! What an excellent story line! I really wish that they had put more money into this film though. The cinematography seems a little low-budget, some close-up scenes are blurred. Nevertheless, the story line still shines true. I will definitely add this to my DVD collection... somewhere between ""Gladiator"" and ""The Best Man."" Well done!"
negative,bad review: It was so low that I could not hear it.I turned my volume up as loud as I could get it but still had toreally listen to get what was going on. also very dark . I loveSmallville & had watched it last night on t.v. but still did notenjoy this cause I could not hear it.
positive,"As CLASSIC as they get....: THE TRANSFORMERS were a cornerstone of many childhood fantasies (even my own). The movie goes above and beyond the series and deals with many issues which are hidden to the children in the audience but seem all too real watching it as an adult. As a long time runner of the comic convention circuit I can tell you that this movie can always be found in the ""hack-mall"" of any good convention but they are usually poor-to-fair only copies. Buy this one before it becomes unavailable again."
negative,"Horrific forced reading: I will never understand why they force this book on school children, I'm sure there are many other ""classic"" stories that could be included in the curriculum."
negative,This book is bad!: This book has typos in critical places. It fails to fully explain arrays. The auther's classes don't always work. You don't learn standard libraries.
positive,"Priced Right: We bought this to fill a duvet cover for summer. It's light weight, as we needed, and serves its purpose, considering the price and quality. Other similar light weight comforters in the marketplace cost 4+ times this one. No sales tax & no shipping (Amazon Prime) help make this a good deal."
positive,"BUY THIS... NOW!: Once upon a time, there were lounge acts and main room acts. The lounge acts are all but gone now. Louis Prima and Keely Smith were the consummate lounge act. They came to Vegas practically starving and became the toast of the Strip. Main room luminaries, such as Sinatra, whiled their after hours with Prima and Smith.Backed by the Witnesses,led by the greatly overlooked and under appreciated Sam Butera, Prima and Smith simply wailed. Butera plays the most lascivious sax around. Listen to him solo or support and be amazed. Don't forget that Prima was a first rate trumpet player in the New Orleans style. As hard as they swing, that style informs their sound.Contrasted to Prima's heat is Smith's cool. She can cut loose, too. If only for Tenderly/Can't Help Loving That Man, buy this record! If you don't come away from this recording happier than before you listened to it, there's something amiss."
positive,"I like em...: I personally like these wipes, I use the fragrance free ones and my 7 month old son who has sensitive skin has not had diaper rash yet. So, in my opinion they do a great job. They leave baby buns with a layer of 'lotion' that I think helps prevent diaper rash. They are a little bit more money, but I think they are worth it. With coupons and sales I get them for around .02 per wipe and will keep buying them."
positive,Awesome Kids Drum Set!!!: We bought this drum set for our 4yr old son & he loves it! It was easy to assemble & it is very stable. It produces great sound & it will last for years!
negative,I just cant do it.: I read the foundation books and was reminded why I don't like asimov. The man has Phd's in chemistry and a gazillion other physical sciences and he likes to show it off. And that makes it very hard for us lay scifi geeks.
positive,THIS CD TOXICITY IS THE BEST: THIS CD IS PURE MEDAL GENIOUS THE WAY THEY USE THIER VOICES AND SO ON. THE SONG DEER DANCE IS THE BEST SONG ON THE ABLM TOXICITYTHIS SONG DIDNT TURN ME ON TILL THE 09/11/01 HAPPEND IT WAS THE PERFICT SONG FOR A MACRAMEDIA VIDEO THAT I DID IT REALLY SPONSERD THE EMOTION THAT WAS FELT WHILE THE ATTACKS WERE HAPPENING. THIS IS THE BEST CD AND SO IS THE FIRST. BEST OF THE BEST
positive,"Quietly surreal: It might not be like 'Earthling', but it is certainly unique. The lyrics are wonderful. This cd doesn't demand much, but it certainly deserves the same attention as the rest of his work. I find it has more heart to it than most music, and has helped make David Bowie one of my favorite artists (among queen, orgy, and korn). It is relfective of the times, and I would hope that the meaning and sound communicated in this masterpiece is what 1999 can be remembered for, not the backstreet boys."
positive,"yes. fire your psychiatrist and listen to airdrawndagger.: i agree with everything J. File wrote below. my favorite sasha album of all time. if you're looking for trance to dance, this isn't it. if you're looking for quality ambient music that will leave you contemplating and in awe, you've found it."
positive,"Usually works better than floss: These brush picks really work. If you want to clean between teeth and massage gums, this is certainly an effective way."
negative,"A disappointment: the only redeeming factor about the whole ""inheritance"" saga is that it was written by a 15 year old! original ideas of various literary greats have been plagirised without a thought. i am surprised that no legal action has been taken by such writers or their representatives against mr. paolini.ps. gets 1 star because amazon wont let me write the review without rating the book and this is the least number of stars."
positive,"Close to Parallels: If you like the Parallels cd, then you will probably like this one too. Inside Out contains songs that, I think, could have easily been included on the Parallels disc, released three years previous. The production on this disc is kind of lacking in bass and depth, but the songs are just as beautiful as those on Parallels."
positive,"coooooooooooooooooool: this toy looks really cool, but i think they should make it have better graphics and a better screen."
positive,"TWO CAROLINES, ONE SUCCESS STORY: I remember my 6th grade teacher reading this book about a hundred times to the entire class. We used to always find it funny and make jokes about the story. As I got older, I realized that this book, although fiction, was very real...how children tend to be on their best behavior in one situation, then the worst in others. Now that my son is almost nine, and going through that ""I can do whatever I want whenever I want"" phase, I have him read this book frequently. He finds this book amusing, but understands where I'm coming from when he's done reading. I cannot claim this book will change your kids forever, but it has made him more aware of his bahavior."
negative,"Maybe ok for warts, not for skin tags.: Received this and rubbed it on a few skin-tags twice a day for 8 days - no change to the skin tag. No change to color, texture or size. It did absolutely nothing for my skin tags.I will try it again if I ever get a wart."
positive,"Just what I needed, holds ALL of my out of season shoes: Other than my boots for which I have a standing-tiered shoe rack, this shoe tree is perfect with enough room to let my 9.5 women's size shoes hang without hitting one another. It has a weighted bottom so that it doesn't fall over and I can easily use the handle on top to pull it out of my closet if I am thoroughly confused as to what pair to wear on a particular day. Definitely a must especially if you have a walk-in closet."
negative,This book has a dire need to be shortened: This book in the beginning was so slow that I finished a book twice it's length before I finished the first chapter of Tess of the D'Urdubervilles.
positive,Worth it: I thought it was an amazing very well put together book. I really enjoyed it the whole way through not one problem
positive,"The last hurrah of the classic lineup: This album represents a crossroads of sorts for Kiss. For the first time in 20 years or so, both Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were back in the lineup. Kiss was back in makeup, and with the lineup restored, things seemed ripe for a great reunion album. Unfortunately, most of the songs come across as slightly weak, and while there are classics throughout, this is no debut album, Hotter than Hell, or Destroyer revisited. My personal favorite on the album is Into the Void, Ace's major contribution to the album. All in all, it beats a lot of the 'unmasked' period works, but only those who really want everything the original lineup made need apply. (The most unfortunate part of the album is that, for the subsequent tour, Peter Criss was again kicked out of the lineup, replaced with former bandmate Eric Singer, who wore Peter's Catman makeup.)"
positive,"Be forewarned... this is NOT the movie!... THANK GOD: A love story infinitely more readable than the Sleeping Beauty set, it delves deep into the human psyche, and attempts to explain how and why someone would choose BSDM as a lifestyle. Plenty of erotica, and a plot too! A great read!"
positive,"""Hard to Kill"" is hard not to like: Just after ""Above The Law"" and before his girth expanded, Seagal made this dandy little action thriller. Set seven years ago on oscar night( and that is as close as he would ever get to one) Seagal gets bad guy Sadler(always fun as the bad man) on video ordering a hit on someone. Well before you can say ""kung fu"" Seagal is shot and left for dead , his wife is killed and his son gets away. But as we all know, if you don't cut him into pieces, just like Jason, Seagal isn't dead, but he is REALLY, REALLY MAD. Never once is this believable but as it moves so fast you never really have much time to think about it."
negative,"if your THAT naive, read this book: I was in real need of some guidance and this book was rated high in a local parenting mag so I picked it up looking forward to reading someone's expert advice. But instead I felt like I was listening to a cheerleader give me advice. Enough already with the exclamation points. I get the basic premise. What I was hoping for was something more substantial backed up with facts and studies. If you have little emotional intelligence you will probably get something out of this book... i have an iota more than a little and found this book ridiculously simplistic."
positive,Romeo & Juliet: Experienced no problems with the order. The book came within the estimated delivery date. The book matched the description given.
negative,"Not as good as I hoped.: Unfortunately, not as good as I hoped and not what it promised to be.Plus, he was arrested for burning an American flag at a college campus - after all that he's done and what has been done for him.Very unfortunate."
negative,"Rewind only good quality: I'm actually glad to see that this vacuum is unavailable--they should stop selling it. The only good feature is the automatic rewinding cord, which works flawlessly. Otherwise it's clunky to use, difficult to replace the cannister and hard to find the button to turn it on when you are standing over it. Ours finally died today after two years and I'm thrilled to be able to replace it with something more functional. I've truly hated this vacuum."
positive,Great: So glad I found this series.. Makes the Old Testament come alive..... I'm now in book 4....looking forward to reading more of Lynn Austin
negative,"Not a good item for semi autos: I just purchased one of these for my 1911 Semi Auto and Model 29 .44 magnum. The foam is too light to hold my semi auto or magazines in place. As soon as I picked up the case, my 1911 and magazines fell to the bottom. Since the Model 29 has a rather large cylinder, that does not seem to be a problem with my big revolver, but who has 4 hanguns without one of them being a semi auto? I do not recommend this case except maybe for large caliber revolvers. They decided to skimp on the foam and the result is a product that fails its most important task: protecting your handguns."
negative,"Interesting Idea-Terrible Execution: When I first heard of this movie I thought it was a remake of the great Argentinian movie ""Man Facing Southeast"". The plot is almost the same but that's where the similarities end. ""Man Facing Southeast"" was an intelligent movie while this was a slow moving, dissapointing mess.From the first scene I knew it was not a very good script. Why was Kevin Spacey's character arrested and taken to a mental hospital, just for saying he was from another planet? Come on, this is Grand Central in New York. Do you think New York police arrest every nut on the street without any valid reason? It just seemed that much of the action in this film was forced, just to move the plot along with no regard for some semblance of reality.Some great actors were totally wasted in this film. Better luck next time!"
negative,yuk!: one of the few books that i just couldn't make myself finish. so bored after reading a third book i just couldnt make myself read any more.'
positive,Extedning Tivo accross the house: Having a Tivo Network Adapter allows me to transfer shows from one Tivo box into a box in another room. the product is solid and since it is made by the manufacturer of the Tivo box it works immediately with no fuss.
positive,etiderm: This product is excellent... Especially if your dog suffers from dry skin and itching during the summer months. The delivery and order process was extremely reliable through this vendor.
positive,Great book!: This is a great book. I had a mortgage broker look at it and he thought it was a good program--the only drawback he saw to it was that it would take discipline. By the way don't pay $80 for this book from 3rd parties. Go to the author website[..]
positive,Beautiful books.: Books arrived in good time and in excellent condition. The cover designs are wonderful.
negative,"Horrible Movie!!!: I absolutely HATED this movie. It was SUCH a waste of my time. The first ten minutes made the movie seem worth watching, but then the storyline, along with my desire to watch it, fell dramatically after that. It was not worth my time! I couldn't wait for the credits to come. I found myself fast forwarding through parts, just to get through it quicker. The main character, Diane Lane, annoyed me. Plus, the storyline was depressing. Nothing ever went right in her life. I don't see what other people see in it. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you actually like being bored senseless."
positive,"An underated masterpiece: Personally i feel this album has not got its just deserves. I am a huge Oasis fan and although not quite as good as Whats the Story morning glory, it certianly comesa close. Nearly all the tracks are superb with stand by me, i hope i think i know, dont go away and all around the world taking the front line. This album is great to listen to and was unfailry snubbed by all those set-in-their-way alternative music fans who think its cool to hate Oasis. A legend of an album by a legend of a band. Peace out."
negative,"horrid e-text: This kindle version is not worth the money, even if very cheap. It is a poor uncorrected ocr scan. It is unreadable and unusable. Find a cleaner edition. This is a rip-off."
negative,"Where was the editor???????: I kept doggedly reading, hoping to return to the storyteller I had found in the first 4 books. Never happened. Was there an editor? Ayla's story deserves to be told without endless repetition of descriptions of scenery, introductions to characters that are never developed, and story lines that are started and then dropped without any explanation. I couldn't recommend this book to anyone."
negative,"Great movie...horrible bootleg: This is terrific Paul Naschy film, but my comments address the presentation of this DVD only.This is a bootleg. They ripped off Sinister Cinema's transfer and matted the opening minutes of the movie to cover up the Sinister watermark that is present for the opening sequences.Don't buy this rip off version, get a copy from Sinister themselves on VHS or DVD-R."
positive,"Damn Lies and Statistics: This truly excellent small book gives a thorough and non-mathematical overview of the dangers and usefulness of statistics. Giving real-life examples of statistical manipulation (without beating one over the head with mathematical formulae). A marvelous way to look at Social Statistics with an inquisitive and educated eye - without having to know the mathematical basis for statistical analysis.AS an undergrad I actually did graduate level work in statistics but enough years have passed that I would be hard pressed to use the knowledge. This book gave me an excellent way to look at statistics in such a way that they are now much more useful to me, not just in my clinical practice but in reading the newspaper.Emilio J. Vazquez, MD"
positive,"Nina shines: I highly recommend this recording, especially for her fans, as one of two last studio recordings. This hip, disco style(sometimes)set with R&B; leanings showcases Nina's ability to tear your insides up with melodic and dramatic skills incomparable in her day. Of special note: ""Saratoga"" ""Touching and Caring"".Ken DelleCave, Miami"
negative,Looks nice but...: Had high hopes for this product but it looks and actually feels rather sharp to the touch. So much so that I removed it from the tank becuase I was afraid my Clown Loach and Cory's would hurt themselves on it. Would probably look good in a tant without a lot of bottom feeders.
positive,"The 2nd best Graphic Novel I've ever read: I think the Watchmen will always be the best graphic novel ever, but this one is a close second for me. I have always chosen Marvel comics over DC, but this book alone, has caused me to become fascinated by the Justice League.This is a drop dead serious story that is not appropriate for kids, but a masterpiece that adults and older teens can enjoy. It will make you think and it might even make you give a family member a longer hug the next time you see them. It's that good. And if you ever wanted to try and get a person who doesn't like comics to try one, I would start with this one, even more so than The Watchmen. Worth every penny."
positive,"sad songs about romance and funny songs about...: ...random things (like suicide, drinking, etc). Some of the sad songs are a little humorous and others are serious and moving. All are entertaining. I find this to be one of the LWIII albums I can listen to the most (I'm the sort of person who listends to a lot of music but has trouble listening to an album more than twice a week even if it's great and I just got it).Go on, give it a try."
positive,"Anastacia does Evanescence!: Anastacia returns after beating cancer, and with a rockier edge that sounds like a soulful version of Evanescence. It's certainly a different style for Anastacia, who had specialized in 80's influenced dance music and ballads. Nevertheless, the chorus is catchy as hell, the entire ""All my life I've been waiting..."" verse is powerful enough to make you ignore any flaws the song may have. I hope the album will be released in North & South America, Anastacia is a force of nature and her success here is long overdue.check out her previous efforts Not my kind and Freak of nature as well. The first album is better than the rushed sophomore release, which shines briefly with ""Paid my dues"", ""Freak of nature"", Overdue goodbye"" and ""You'll never be alone""."
positive,kewl cd: this cd is awesome!Usher is sooo hot. His voice and lyrics rhyme and match perfectly. This is truly a turning point in his career.I think everyone should get this alubum.
negative,Product Quality - Poor: Ordered for a 2012 Toyota Tacoma. Product has failed after ~ 5 months. Product is almost exclusively made of plastic which is unfortunate. Mechanism actuated by the key which is supposed to enable freewheeling of the top of the cap no longer disengages.Would not recommend
positive,"Of Mice and Men: I liked the book, but it was kind of sad in a good way though because no matter what George knew that Lennie was going to die so he killed him in a less painfull way.Steinbeck created really good characthers because they were so believable that it could of most likely been a non-fiction story. It's a good novel for young adults because it talks about stuff that could happen in real life and little kids might not understand the story or the words in the story. The social issue that it relates to is probably racism."
positive,Psychological thriller!: This movie really scared me when it came out in theaters years ago. It is still pretty exciting and leaves you wondering if the guy is really crazy or his dummy is alive!
negative,Edited for Television: Very disappointed in this tape. This tape contains a copy of the movie that was apparently edited for television. I say that becuase I noticed that there were several scenes cut from the movie. The movie on this tape doesn't flow correctly and there are references in the movie to scenes that the viewer never sees.I wouldn't recommend the purchase of this tape.
negative,"great movie massacred by tape quality: One of my all time favorite movies has been edited for television recorded extended long play, and packaged as though nothing was done to it. don't buy this tape wait for the dvd version that should be coming out soon."
negative,"VERY disappointed!!!: I thought I would like this book as the subject manner and descriptions sounded interesting. But the author would start a train of thought and then abort the idea and move on to another - I seemed like I was listening to an crudely abridged version! I will NOT read another of hers if this is the way she writes. I was very disappointed...this book could have been great!!!! The characters I felt were shallow and so much more could have been done to deepen their personalities, thoughts and feelings."
positive,Chasing Darkness: Another winner by Danielle Girard!!!!!!!!Very suspenseful and good character development.It is a great read and the time will go really fast withso much suspense in the story.
positive,"Real Life Horror Story: This book is not for everyone. It is extremely scary and disturbing. At the same time, it is a fascinating look at the police work and prosecution that brought the murderous Manson Family to justice. The book is hard to put down; the in depth discussion on presenting a criminal case in court and developing evidence to support the case is outstanding. The main complaint is that the book is a few hundred pages too long. The author seems a little too self-promoting, but then again he did get a prosecution on one of the biggest murders in history."
negative,Not as described: What I recieved from Geroy's was 26 gauge and was labled as such. This was useless to me. There is a big differance betwee 26 gauge and 12 gauge thickness.
negative,"Wish I could retrun: The speakers sounded great upon opening the box. Within a week, the sub wolfer quit working. Since I know longer have the original box, I can not return the item."
positive,"Loved it: A lot of information in this book that I never knew about Ben. It is short, and was not complete, but still a lot about his younger years."
negative,"Terrible: Does not fit the window in our 2008 Prius at all. In fact the left side of the shade is considerable taller than the right. Not sure who was in charge of quality control the day they made ours, but they must have been drunk.It does seem to be made of quality materials, but what does that matter when it can't be used due to the incorrect size?The shade is also far too bulky when rolled up. Not a problem if you don't ever plan on having people ride in your back seat or if you don't mind storing it in the hatch and getting it out of there whenever you park or don't mind taking it down and storing it back there when you leave.All in all this thing gets an F from me. I honestly can't get over how poorly it fits."
negative,"Slllloooowwwwwww and slower: I made it through about an hour of this horrible picture, I kept hoping something would happen. When a monster? finally appeared, it was like watching a silly kiddie horror film, after this I said I've had enough, everyone else watching it with me felt the same way. This was the british version, uncut."
positive,"A bit pricey, but effective: These work great to keep babies soothed and comforted to help them fall asleep; babies who would otherwise flail their arms and keep themselves awake. You decide! My twins just outgrew the small size, so I'm upgrading to medium.4 stars only because of the price."
negative,"no signal: Both me adn my mom bought this phone about 6 months ago. She's had her's replaced once already because the screen woulnd't come on. Neither of the phones ever get good reception, with an average of 2 bars, which quickly disapear if the phone is lifted to the ear."
positive,"ok: Cable works fine. First time into HD connection. Saw other cables on other sites which were way too high. Bought this, works fine!Payed more for shipping than for the cable itself. Don't know what the expensive cables do but I'm sure not much more than this."
negative,"Dream Girls: I was very disappointed. Everyone has compared this story to the Supremes, but the music was not even close to the Supremes. It was more like from the 40's. It didn't sound anything like the 60's music or even the music from the 50's. It reminded me more of Westside Story. It was a mis-representation. I am a big Beyonce Knowles fan, but the music provided for her was a big disappointment."
negative,"Pass on this, go directly to Julia Child: I was very glad once I finished this book, it was the only book I have ever wanted to throw directly into the trash (which I did). Julie Powell is a lazy, whiney, high-maintenance, self-centered, self-absorbed, unappealing person. If her year of cooking was a year of self discovery, then it appears there was nothing there to discover. But then Julia was all about you and Julie is all about herself and I can find nothing in the book to provide a good reason for her self-absorption."
positive,"A Nice Start: An early work of Gordon, it reflects on his fascination with the world of Medicine. Unlike his best work in The Physician and Shaman, Death Committee searches out modern cutting edge medicine. At times he seems in awe of the mortals who struggle to solve the puzzle of transplantation. He does an accurate job for 1969 when the book was published.I expected more incite to the characters. Having read his wonderful later works first, my expectations were high. Trying to put this in perspective as a second novel, it showcases Gordon's development as a character writer.It is a clever quick read and highly recommended for those who like Gordon's later works, but I would read the later works first."
negative,"Do not buy this product.: I have a number of Xantrex products and have found them to be good quality. I cannot say the same for thier product support. I have a Powersource 1800 that shorted out. It is less than 2 years old (20 months). It is out of warranty. I am willing to pay to have it repaired. They will NOT repair it or sell parts for it. The best they will do is sell me another unit at 30% off list. I was informed by customer suppoer that they do not repair products that are out of warranty. So beware buying Xantrex(aka Scnieider Electric), Durucell branded Xantrex products, and APC(a Schneider Electric company). Once they are out of warranty, if something happens to the you can throw them in the trash heap."
positive,Loved it!: I have never taken it upon myself to read this wonderful classic. I very much enjoyed it and highly recommend it to all.
positive,"Exit Wounds: This was my first J A Jance book and my first one in the Joanna Brady series. This mystery is packed with twists and turns that keep you reading to see what is going to happen next. I also enjoyed how the author addressed the town and family dynamics in the book with out being ""wordy"". This book was a fast and exciting read with a suprise ending. I look forward to reading all the books by this author."
positive,"Clan of the Cave Bear: This is a truly touching book, in which you follow the life of Ayla, a girl born to the ""Others"", who is found by Iza, the top medicine woman of the Clan( aka cave people). You explore the feelings of the characters. Auel has created a wormhole into the past. Each character is distinct in itself, and you have a story outline both dramatic and explicit. When Creb\ Mog-ur performs his ceremonies, you feel as if you are there. It's like watching a movie, only deeper. You explore the humiliation of Creb's deformaty, the stubborness of Broud, and the kindness and caring of Iza. When Ayla is discovered to be hunting against the Clan laws, you plead along with her against the death curse. This is a truly wonderfull book. There are some mature parts, so if you don't feel you can handle them, don't try. Once again, I strongly reccomend this book!"
positive,A real tear jerker: Great true story. I remember this movie from when i was a kid. I watched it with my children. A bit graffic in spots but with animals in the wild i guess that it is hard to avoid.
positive,"Excellent: This is one of the more entertaining books I have ever read. The characters are well-developed, the story is exciting, unexpected and largely believable, and the events and setting took me to a strange land north of where I live, but had never really considered before.Apparently this was part of Michener's book on Alaska, and would have made a nice addition to that book. This rivals the chapter in Alaska dealing with the Chilcott Pass."
negative,"Good idea, poor execution: Tom Brokaw is not a gifted writer. He wrote this book in the same dry and simple style as he uses with his TV audience. The book is completely stripped of romance and soul for the sake of the lowest common denominator. I have met many WW2 veterans who tell stories woven with romance and heartbreak that bring tears to your eyes. This is not represented in any of the 4 page biographies of these common place heroes. Pure non-fiction at its most uninspiring."
positive,"A good libertarian primer: This book is a little outdated, and a little heavy on the libertarianism, but otherwise it's a very easy read, and I particularly like some of the stories it uses to present basic economic ideas."
positive,"Exciting!: This novel grabbed by interest from the very beginning and held it to the last word. Gods and Kings is a beautifully written action packed story. I recommend it to anyone interested in history, religion, action.... its a great read!"
negative,"Dull Wombat: I was dragged against my will to the local suburban theater to watch this tepidly dull and overtly violent film. Suffice it to say I left the theater about half way through this tedious exercise in patience. This is plainly J-U-N-K. It concerns the wildly popular video game and brings the characters to 'life' or should I say, 'to death'? The fighting scenes are horrible, and there are too many of them and they are so violent that one becomes sickened by it all. There is also excessively loud techno music to add to the disaster. I would prefer watching the old Shaw brothers Kung-Fu movies better than this banal viewing."
positive,"A great cot toy - but can it really send babies to sleep?: This is sold partly as a toy and partly as a device to aid sleep. My 9 month old has not yet got to sleep using it, as it distracts him, but this may be different for other babies. He does love playing with it, watching the fish, listening to the music and batting the lever to make the little starfish spin.The water leaked slightly during our transaltantic 'plane flight (not the manufacturer's fault but it's worth knowing). It would benefit from having a few more controls - perhaps they couldput Spongebob Squarepants in to make it perfect!"
positive,Another great one for Blair: This was the first book I read by Blair and I loved it. She is very creative and keeps the story interesting. I loved the personalities of both Lady Eleanor and John Caldwell. I always like it when a child is involved too. This was another one I could not put down and handed around to a lot of friends to read. They loved it too!
positive,"REDy Steady Clean: HEPA filter and auto chord rewind features are nice. Not too heavy, and wide clean paths ensure clean strokes. Bagless feature is a plus...so far so good."
negative,One good song: Zoot Suit Riot is great. The rest almost put me to sleep. I liked Setzer's CD a lot more.
negative,"EXCELLENT but.......: Absolutely excellent!a mixture of pace, adventure, humor, add some originality to it!very good cocktail for young and old!BUT there is no audio French, not even subtitles !!!!! what a shame for the editor so I put only ONE STAR because of that !!!I got it in VHS and I transform it by myself, and I saw it in TV in FRENCH, so it exists !!"
negative,"Really... get rid of Bradley...: The ONLY reason I am giving this book a MARGINAL 2 stars is because it is entertaining in how bad it is. The plot is contrived, the characters are one sided and annoying and the writing is wretched. And no... it's not even funny. I didn't even crack a grin.But probably the biggest annoyance with the book is how annoying the characters itself are. Lucy tries so desperately to assert her ""independence"" it's irritating... and the bad boy sexy mytery cop? The whole mid-life crisis thing made him not so mysterious... and defiantly not sexy...Honestly there were times when I had to stop reading in the middle of a chapter and just walk away because it just raditated with... stupidity.If you want to read about a smart, funny airhead, with not one but TWO sexy men than please check out Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum series.Trust me, you're wasting your time by reading the title."
negative,DISAPPOINTED: I had high hopes for this very worthwhile topic. Reads like Mr. Brokaw is presenting a report on the late news. I expected a more developed presentation.
negative,"zero customer service: I bought the system with the amplifier to run from one building to another (250 feet). It worked fine in the building the transmitter was located, but the quality completely fell apart once I crossed into the second building. I saw a forum where someone recommended a different high-gain antenna and tried contacting the company for suggestions for over a week with zero response. The tech support voice mailbox was full, the operator never answered the phone and I left repeated messages there. I tried e-mailing and calling every department I could locate. Half the phone numbers were disconnected and no response on the e-mails either.The product might have worked fine if I had a little tech support from the company. But as it stands I'm going on the assumption that RF-Link has gone out of business and so I'm returning my purchase."
negative,signature collection handkerchiefs are polyester: I wanted cotton handkerchiefs. These are a polyester blend and have more of a polyester than a cotton feel.
negative,"overpriced: I bought this poncho for my little girl. She broke her arm so she needed something to keep her warm. It came on time. When I opened the package the price on the poncho had been ripped off. It had several ""sale"" stickers on were the price had also been ripped off. My daughter wore it once and two of the little flowers fell off. I wouldn't purchase anything from this vendor. They overprice their items online and the quality of the item is poor."
positive,"Excellent Documentary of one of the Greatest Albums in History: This is one of those movies that I didn't want to end. It is that good. Seeing Robbie, Levon, Rick, and Garth look back at this album, and talk in depth about the making of it, was pure heaven. Seeing the joy on Levon's face when talking about Garth's playing put a smile on my face. I'm not waxing poetic here, folks. If you love the Band, do yourself a favor and get this DVD."
positive,"The past, future and present: This is the best Watch book yet. I would give it more stars if I could. It isn't a good place to start reading either the Disc World books or the City Watch series. While this book does contain the expected funny satire and puns they are for the most part found at the beginning of the book. This book is a darker, more serious look at the characters and the city. The book introduces the younger selves of many of the older watch members and Vetinari. It explains how Vimes went from an idealistic newbie to a disallusioned drunk. This transformation isn't spelled out but can be discerned from what the older Vimes sees in his younger self and what we know of him from the previous books. It is a book about heroes, redemption, evil and the price of freedom."
negative,"Great Book, Inumerable Glaring Errors: I love this book, it was a great read.However, there are simply too many mistakes, misspellings, etc in this version. This is the very worst edition of any book I have ever read. I started highlighting the mistakes on my kindle, but there were just too many and I gave up.Add to that that the chapters are not marked, and there is no proper index.If you do buy this horrible edition, be prepared to read around an obvious error every other page or so.Some examples include:""There were four others oil the committee""""And they would sit round die table""Bottom Line: I want my money back."
positive,"Works Great: Cheap, made in China, but it gets the job done. I use to connect my PS3 to my TV and it works with no problems."
positive,"One of the best electro records: My type of electro! Keith Tenniswood of Two Lone Swordsmen fame demonstrates his solo credibility here with his superb debut album.Combining breaks and beats with smooth, simple melodies, Tenniswood brings all that is good about electro music together.What made the songs on here even better are the beautiful electronic, ambient, pulsating and shimmering walls of sound Tenniswood creates behind his songs. Fans of Two Lone Swordsmen will know what I'm talking about, and Tenniswood uses this skill to great effect on this album.An excellent, consistent electro, breakbeat album, with strong hints of electronica and IDM. One of the best electronic albums of the past few years."
negative,"Do Not Buy: When you buy a public domain book, all you really want is a well-formatted edition. This isn't it. The left margin is wider than the right margin. Kindle formatting isn't hard; why can't public domain publishers get it right!"
negative,"Goofy!: This film marked the singularly unspectacular acting(?) debut of champion gymnast Kurt Thomas, and attempted to cash in on his Olympic fame. However, good athletes don't necessarily make good actors, and Kurt's performance proves it. The rest of the cast isn't much better, and the script is dreadful. However, there are some fun moments in this film. The scene in the village of the lunatics is pretty bizarre, some of the extras are truly creepy-looking, and the sheer lunacy of the plot provides some good laughs. If you have ever wondered what Ed Wood could have done with a martial-arts film, watch this one."
negative,"Slowstarter even for King: I'm not too excited about this, actually. I thought this one felt a lot in tone and mood as The Tommyknockers, easily the weakest King novel of them all. The punch isn't really packed here, I'd expected more. The first 250 pages were the hardest to get through.I wouldn't compare this to IT. In a sense of scope, it is, but on the whole... I dunno.That multi-angled thingee could have been done sharper. This is just too blunt."
positive,"I am typing this with my antennae: Since buying this product from Amazon I am now invincible at croquet and can sing all of Andy Williams' songs (since 1974) at the same time. What's more, I'm able to change night into day with a small shake of my mandibles, and have just worked out how to make cheese on toast levitate. I would write more, but I'm needed in the ionosphere."
negative,"Very Slow Read... A far departure from his first books: I used to be an avid John Grisham fan. I would anxiously wait for his books to come out and be one of the first to purchase a book. Lately, his books have strayed and have not caught my interest. This book sounded like it could be in line with his first books, so I was anxious to read it. I can usually finish a Grisham book in less than a day... this one dragged for about a week. I forced myself to finish it so I could start a new book. The main character is not very interesting and it makes it hard to feel any involvement in the choices he makes in his life. If John Grisham continue the same trend, I will have to find a new author to enjoy."
negative,"Torture: Too tight,wanted to help me get back in shape after my baby, couldn't even close the whole thing!Returned it ASAP"
positive,"Something for Everyone: This is one of the best books I have ever read. I think it would appeal to anyone, male or female, people who like to be kept on their toes by a story and people who like to be able to understand the characters in the story and their actions. This is a story that will stay with you. Whenever I see the names of the characters in this story- Burden, Stanton, I think of this book. It is that memorable. Definitely a book to re-read every few years, as you get older, you will relate to or understand different parts of the book."
positive,"Enthralling: I read it to my 9 & 11 year old grand children. Actualy we took turns reading. We were all enthralled with the story. I plan to buy the series as it gives us fantastic quility time together, not playing video games and such. They want to come over just read with me and see what is going to happen next. My grand daughter the 9 year old is now trying to write her own book. She loves the idea that there is nothing stopping her from becoming an Author. She has seen that I wrote a book about selling photography and have it avaiblie on amazon for the Kindel, This has inspired her to wright and thats a great thing.Turn Your Camera into a Cash Machine"
positive,"Wow!!! Another hit!: It's rare that an author can keep writing one series, churning them out at speed, and still keep the novels fresh! Pratchett's secret seems to be that he doesn't spit out novels about the same characters over and over: he has essentially split the Discworld into many almost completely separated series, connected only by cameo appearances of some favorite characters.Night Watch focuses, not surprisingly, on Captain Vimes the Night Watch. This particular story reads much more like a science fiction novel than many of his works, with a pretty common sci-fi theme, but made fresh by Pratchett's perspective.The reuse of such a common theme was why I only rated this a 4, not a 5. However, this book is a great read, totally worth the money, and the time!!!"
negative,"Disappointing: Weak structure, underdeveloped and even annoying characters, silly dialog, and a few hard-to-swallow action scenes (even for cartoons) make this far worse than the first. The animation is kind of nice but doesn't make up for the basic shortcomings in story, plot, and characters."
negative,"HORRIBLE!: This is unbelievably horrible! This movie dosen't even have anything to do with Michael Myers. Why would anyone keep the name ""Halloween"" and make it about some man making mask??? If you like boring, and disappointing movies this is the movie to see. It has an ok story but they could have used a different title."
positive,"You can't do it in one line.....: Ok so this book, has got me boggled, anyone with any insights or anything E-mail me Danita1982@aol.com... I think this is a good book but it lacks imagery.. It can be slow at times but its a clssic all the same.. To put the book breifly Moll screws all the men and women for that matter she is a crafty as they come, she always has a motive... always... And she abandons all of her kids... I havent seen the movie but I hear its bad Danielle"
negative,"Not what I expected: I had really been looking forward to this book, expecting (and hoping for) a return to the great legal thrillers that made me a John Grisham fan. Unfortunately, this book wasn't what I expected at all. The book centers around a young newspaper editor in Clanton, Mississippi during the 1970's. Rather than a murder mystery or a legal suspense book, it is a story about a small southern town dealing with the issues of the day, including Vietnam and desegregation. The murder and trial are only a very small part of the actual plot. They help to explain the town and the people living there and it provides some action to keep the plot moving, but don't expect to be surpised at the ending.All in all, it wasn't a bad book if you're looking for a story about a small southern town, but if you're looking for a good legal thriller, this isn't it."
positive,"An amusing morality tale of business and a teaching tool.: Looking for a teaching tool for undergraduates who would not have cultural contacts with the corporate environment, this film has been a useful introduction to the current corporate crazes. As Tom Wolfe depicted the markets in ""Barnfire of the Vanities"", this little comedy has a useful correlate in alerting us to some of the paradoxes of the business world. It is not always true that the capitalist using the 'bottom-line mentality' is the enemy of anyone but those who misuse the power and authority of managing a business. As ""Wallstreet"" depicts aspects of ""insider-trading"", OPM weaves its own morality play about the nature of ""nice"" when the issue is ""performing"" when you have borrowed other people's money. It is a good screenplay, a tight drama, and a useful experience for a college level audience. END"
positive,"Reading can seldom be this much fun!: Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said, there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters, but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics', etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling, and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation."
negative,"Inconsistent: The company that employees me purchased 5 of these monitors a few years ago. 1 was blurry and we never could get it sharp. 1 was blurry and the guns never wanted to work right (so the color was never very good). They are VERY susceptible to magnetic fields, and will shake severely when near a power conduit. We had to move our desks when we moved into a new office to keep the monitors from driving us crazy.We have had Sony Trinitron monitors before, and in general we have liked them. These, however, do not seem to come up to the standards that one expects from Sony."
negative,"Sorry Jim: As a former realtor, Mr. Cole owes the natural world a large debt, and believes he is doing good work. My opinion, based upon a life lived in the northern rockies, is that bears NEVER benefit from interactions with humans. The natural world is not there for us to enjoy, or understand, or study - it is simply there. If you are looking for a better understanding of bears, read Steve Herreros book and if you like pretty pictures, check out any of the other authors online who do not routinely place bears at risk by forcing encounters."
negative,"LEAKS !!!: I AM SO DISSAPOINTED WITH THE NEW BABY DRY DIAPERS .I have been using Pampers cruisers for my son and have rarely had any leakage ..Maybe an occassional leak which is not bad.I was happy with Pampers.I decided to give ""Baby Dry"" a try bcos it claimed to have a more absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I am sooo disappointed. The core seems to be WAAAAAYYY inferior to the Cruisers core and leaks !! I started using them a few days back and my son has woken up atleast 5 nights crying bcos he was soaking wet !! :(This morning I was holding him and my shirt felt wet. The diaper was leaking and it went thru his clothes onto mine !! So its not just about night time leaks. So much for absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I was better off with my tried and trusted Cruisers.NEVER HAD SUCH A BAD CASE OF LEAKS WITH CRUISERS .......WILL NEVER USE BABY DRY DIAPERS AGAIN.I hope Pampers is not dropping its quality :("
positive,"angelina: Most of the album is o.k...but what stands out is Angelina's voice on ""Alepheva"". Angelina is a new vocalist, born and raised in Okinawa Japan. It's good to see how far she has come, especially from a tiny island in the Pacific. Her voice has matured wonderfully. Great job!"
negative,lord of the flies: I think that the book was boring till the last two chapters then it started to pick up a little and get interesting.I think the book was slow moving and drawn out in alot of the chapters and the kids needed to get a difffrent method of talking and leader ship because the book was getting drawn out with all of the fighting and complanig kids would do it started to hurt your head.The worst part of the book was the ending because it ended with the kids getting rescued and they started to cry like wimps after they all ready killed two kids. The best part was when the kids were getting killed then the story started to pick up a little but then it got dumb after the rampage stoped. Thats why this gets a rating of two.
positive,HDMI Cable: Does what a HDMI cable is suppose to do. Connected it from my xbox 360 to my HD tv and works perfectly.
negative,CASH MONEY AND NO LIMIT ARE THA SAME THANG!: THERE BEATS ARE DIFFERENT THAN NO LIMITS BUT THERE FROM THA SAME PLACE AND THERE GHETTO HOOD IS VERY CLOSE.THEY RAP JUST LIKE NO LIMIT.BUT NO LIMIT WAS FIRST AND IT WILL BE THA LAST.NO LIMIT IS STILL NUMBER1 IN EVERY WAY.
negative,"Spend a little more and get quality instead: Purchased this to replace an old Panasonic Auto stop. Loved it initially, but with two kids sharpening pencils for school--not unreasonable, it lasted less than 6 months. The old Panasonic lasted 10 years. For the cost, I wish I has spent more and purchased something of better lasting quality.We sharpen 24 pencils each at the beginning of the year and colored pencils--sets of 12, then it's just as needed. This will last if rarely used."
positive,"I remember watching this movie when I was little: I enjoyed this book, it opened my eyes on how hard the Times were back then. Francis was a strong person."
positive,"How thin the veneer of civilization ..: I first read this book as a young teenager and I've revisited it twice since then. There many messages in this novel for those who seek them but for me the key message was how a group of children organise themselves in order to survive.Resourceful, ruthless and inventive are some of the adjectives that first came to mind. The boys demonstrate the best and then, increasingly, the worst of human behaviour. Jack and Ralph each have strengths and weaknesses: there is no single leadership model which best addresses the situation the boys find themselves in.Whether you read this as an allegory or as a black and bleak adventure story, 'Lord of the Flies' invites you to think about what you might do in similar circumstances.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
negative,"Coffee Never Hot Enough: My coffee cup just barely fit on the plate. I thought I would try a different manufacturer of mug warmers. I already had one that worked. Both products worked the same. I realize that the voltage has a limit on it, but it just doesn't keep the coffee hot enough unless you can drink your cup of coffee in 30 minutes. I sip on mine for 2 hours and get very tired of continually having to zap the coffee in the microwave just to heat it up while still using the coffee warmer.Can the manufacturer's come up with a better idea that actually works?"
negative,"Don't buy into the HYPE!!!!!!: Okay, this story has been told at least a hundred times and the writing is downright flat and unimaginative. Do not confuse this with what real fantasy should be. Try George R. R. Martin, Tad Williams or Robin Hobbs to name a few of the fantasy masters that can tell a story with originality and readability. This book had nothing to motivate me to finish it or even care how it ends. A good fantasy book should be a treat to read and should draw you into the story wishing it would never end. This book does not. My advice to Mr. Paolini: Get some fresh material and than maybe you'll earn the respect of hardcore fantasy readers."
negative,Too wordy....: I got this book cuz I enjoyed the Philisopical strangler book. I found this book entirely too wordy. I enjoyed certain parts of the book. I burst out in laughter in a couple of places but it was too little. I could see what the authors were trying to do but it was not enuf.. I liked the strangler book.
negative,"Not as I had hoped for: Living on the Gulf Coast of Texas, our winters are seldom cold - it rarely gets to 30 degrees. The description did not mention that these were heavy and designed for really cold weather. I now have useless sleepwear."
positive,"Fun in a small package!: I bought Moon Patrol and Spy Hunter for the GameBoy Color from this vendor and it arrived fast and in excellent condition. I am very pleased with my purchase. These games are great classics and fun to play for all ages. The smaller format of the GameBoy make them a bit harder to play than the original arcade versions, but you can't beat the charm of a classic and the portability of GameBoy. Nice for me to slip back to the past, and fun to share with my 10 year old."
negative,"As low quality as you can get: Literally broke the first time I used them. I bought two, thinking that they were cheap and probably more prone to breaking. But I certainly didn't expect each of them to fail after ONE use. Pathetic. Don't waste your time and money on these incredibly low-quality items."
negative,"Toilet Music: Any album that is strictly ALL COVER TUNES of great songs already gone platinum is just asking for a big big can of whoop-arse! Mandy Moore needs to just go away. She's fluff and her fifteen minutes of fame is long overdue. The ride is over Mandy, get off the horse and quit showin off! You're nothing special!"
positive,Wonderful Bible Study Resource: HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE teaches you how to do the inductive Bible study method found in Precept upon Precept courses. It served as a handy guide when I used it along with my Precept Bible study. Its hands on approach helped me to receive the most from my Precept lessons.Precept studies will train you to go deeper into God's Word; you wll learn how to feed yourself from Scripture.I recommend HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE to those of you who want to begin in depth Bible study. Precept upon Precept gets you into the Word so that the Word gets into you.
positive,"A great book on Texas Hold'Em: This is so far the best book of its type that I have read. The book starts off slow and basic, but it really gets going after 30 pages or so. Wenzel's writing style is concise, easy to follow, and entertaining. He gives great analogies, and specific examples of card play. All the odds, and intricacies of the game are covered, including how to spot ""tells"" on your opponents. But most importantly it reads so smoothly, you will look up and notice that you've already read 40 pages and substantially added to your poker knowledge. I wouldn't miss this book if you want to improve your game."
negative,"Reaaally sucks!!!: The only song that's worth listening to on this album is ""Break in"" and it can be found on Superstar DJ Keoki's ""Transatlantic move"". Go for his album instead..."
positive,"Simply Amazing!: Clay is simply amazing! His powerful, crystal clear voice is shown on all cuts; I have never listened to a CD where I have liked every single track on it. My favorite song keeps changing daily. This CD is every bit worth the money to buy it and more. No wonder it sold double platinum."
positive,Great book....lots of local information: A great read for any Minnesota sports fan. Extremely interesting approach with a number of authors giving a lot of local information about small town teams and how black baseball players were accepted...or not accepted...in rural Minnesota. I found the articles dealing with the small towns much more interesting than the big city articles. I remember watching one of the games many years ago and found some new information that I did not know.
negative,"Erm...Sucked: This movie had NOTHING to do w/ the story line of ""Halloween"". I'm sorry but if your going to make a sequel to a film, atleast stick w/ the STORYLINE.No Michael Myers and if my memory serves me right, I think Michael Myers was the main character in the series. I personally think the sequels should of died off after Halloween 2, but that's just me.I suppose the storyline was ""OK"" but a bit too predictable when you start getting torwards the middle, atleast too me it was. The only thing I liked about the film was the annoying adverisement for the masks.. I think they spent too much time on that and not enough time on the storyline... It got boring after a while...Not worth buying or renting, I may add. If you want to see it, wait until it comes on telly and watch it then, that's just my opinion of course..."
positive,"Fast transaction: I was expecting for the product to arrive after 30days but viola! in just 5 days, it was already with me.It was a fast transaction indeed."
negative,Out of date before it even hit the presses!: HTML 4 has gone through MAJOR revisions since this book was published. Not much here makes sense or even works! Why buy an obviously out of date book? I took the book back. Will NEVER ever buy another book written by Rick Darnel! The problem is made worse by the fact you have to suffer through 300 pages of background material before you ever get to the HTML. This MUST be the authors way of hiding what they knew as major problems. No sugar coating here. JUNK is JUNK!
positive,"Dorman 38437 Door Hinge Repair Kit: This Kit did work , but if I was to do it again i would go for the kit with threaded studs"
positive,"THIS CD IS EXCELLENT!: I gave this CD five stars because of Clays incredible voice. I will concede the fact that the production and the song choices could have been better. Nevertheless, Clays voice is so AMAZING that any shortfalls in the production and material is easily offset with Clays musical prowess. There are however, some excellent songs on this CD, such as The Way, Perfect Day, Measure of a Man and Shine.DONT LISTEN TO THE CLAY HATERS THAT COME HERE ON AMAZON AND GIVE THIS CD ONLY ONE STAR! Those people are just haters of good music and they are trying to persuade you not to buy this CD. Also, granted some of the five star reviews may be from ""Claymates"" but that does not negate the fact that this CD is really good.BUY THIS CD! It is entertaining and fun. Isn't that why we all buy CD's, to be entertained?"
positive,Excellent!: This is a great addition to the Stargate universe. You see all the favorite characters and get an actual end to an on-going storyline. I enjoy it a lot.
positive,"Could Really Happen: A lot of people have compared this to Hostel, but this is a much better movie than Hostel. First of all, this movie has more of a plausible plot. Young people on vacation in Brazil are lured away from their hotel to become unwilling organ donors. Josh Dumal, Fergie's hubby and former Vegas star, is one of the actors. I think organ stealing is possible and maybe even probable when certain groups of people (can you say drug cartels?) have unlimited money. I have definitely seen some weird situations in Brazil and in other places in South America. Thank God that none of the things I have seen compare to this movie. Very scary. The acting is good, the tension and thriller elements are good and even the scenery is good. It is very gory though, so if you cannot stand the blood, get out of the jungle operating room."
negative,"Disappointing!: Teresa Medieros is one of my favorite authors--I usually pick up her books just on the basis of her name, knowing I'll find a well-written story laced with humor and romance. But this book was completely disappointing! Compared to her other novels, this one was sorely lacking, in terms of underdeveloped characters and ridiculous plot twists. It just didn't pull me in; the novel is definitely not up to par. Sorry, Teresa, this one just doesn't cut it. Here's to hoping your next novel maintains your usual excellent standard!"
negative,"Some of the *worst* acting I've seen: Don't waste your money. Thankfully I borrowed this from the library. This is some of the worst acting I've ever seen, and a complete insult to a great book and a great author.If the intention was to find a cast who is completely incompitent, than the goal was accomplished. Since it was made in 1990, the poor special affects can be forgiven, but not the acting.There's not much more to say. This was disgusting."
positive,"Pretty good: I like this movie, i think it shows a lot more about Spider-man then the first movie did, the strength was done well, him stopping the train was amazingly done, and anyone who watched the first movie will get a kick out of the scene in the train, when people try to defend Spider-man, much like in the first one, but get taken out by Doctor Octopus, it's filled with a lot more jokes, that add their own flare, the love story is a little cheesy but it's sci-fi, if there is nothing cheesy in the movie, it's not sci fi, i love this movie."
positive,Nice idea: Purchase several of these flashlight for the family cars. you have to shake quite a bit and they do work. Not the brightest light by will do what batteries fail.I will give this idea an A+
positive,I love DM: I am 26 years old and I have been a fan of Depeche Mode since I was about 10 years old. I remember listening to this tape with my sister in her room and thinking how great this band is. I still love their music. I listen to them every day. I have all their CDs and I got to see them in concert during there Exciter tour. I guarantee that you will fall in love with Depeche Mode and appreciate their talents and Martin Gore's song writing skills.
negative,"Something went wrong...: Music is what happens between the notes, someone said. I read Communion, I listened to the audio book reading by Roddy McDowell. As skeptical as I am inclined, both versions got me and gave me vibes of high weirdness. While I listened and read, I bought it. So when I got hold of the video, I was hopeful. But FILMING it and making it a visual treatment hit a brick wall. I watched, found myself saying every few minutes, 'oh give me a Break!', or 'You can't be serious..' I believed Strieber's account LESS after watching. A reading, either on paper or listening to a story teller, reaches inside the mind. Film is for the eyes, visuals first.If you want to test plausibility, take the mystery out of the shady corners inside the mind and put it out front, under lights and cameras. If you can translate it, you might have credibility left."
positive,"What if......: I'm sure if we lived during the Cold War era and read this book, we would all be truly scared to death. Clancy's scenario of how the the whole world is sucked into war is so scary because of how plausible and realistic it is (all because a couple of Islamo-fascists decide to blow up an oil factory). This is THE best Clancy book, by far."
positive,"A must read if you want to save your money from the "" SHARKS: Written in a conversational style with plenty of humor, this book gives you the questions and answers you need to keep and increase monies that are being put away for investing and retirement. This book lays out a program for getting the best bang for your bucks, and gives an eye opening education on how the "" Market "" really works. I have purchased three books already and am purchasing five more to give to friends and relatives who want to salvage their portfolios from the ""SHARKS"" on Wall Street."
negative,Not worth it: The lyrics are the lamest I have heard in a while. It is way to repetitive. This is not worth the money. You would be better spending it on another cd. It only has one good song.
positive,"excellente dvd concert: amazing wonderfull any people around my edge will be happy to enjoy this eantactic collection ,thanks amazon for the oportunity"
negative,"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin: The reader needs to be prepared for the minute information included in this autobiography - most of which is boring. However, for it to have been written by Benjamin Franklin himself makes it a little more interesting."
negative,"FOR LOVE OF GOD AND COUNTRY: Please I read this book to give chance to opposition but found no credibility in the writers themselves. No Footnotes come on. Please go to [...]or even better go to their wallbuilders live podcast and find out about what the forefathers intended. They talk of the true definition of seperation of church and state. While at the same time hold ownership of articles that are displayed at the Smithsonian. They own thousands of articles including forefather letters and journals. In their own words letting you know from fact that this was to be a God Fearing Nation. David Barton offers books with insight into this subject for real minimal prices. I have seen his books and cd's on amazon. Doesnt it make sense to trust the words directly from our forefathers hand written words, or atleast from some one that owns the actual articles. See for yourselves please. May God Bless America."
positive,"Great Movie: I had heard about this movie from my grandaughter. Amazon gives a very explicit description of what the movie is about. The movie I received was in great shape, plays very well, and I love the movie! Please check out Amazon.com new or used stuff before you purchase in a store!"
positive,"REVIEW: It was very heartwarming at times and tragic at other times. It was sad and happy ,and very funny I think that it was a well written book"
positive,"A great CD full of terrific tunes and amazing lyrics.: This CD is the best CD I've ever heard! How did it go unoticed? It's full of terrific lyrics and fast-paced, exciting tunes. This is a must for all music lovers!"
positive,Good but litle expensive: It is very good but it is becoming little expoensive at amazon as compared to other brands available at stores like costco.
negative,"Like Warm Decaf...: I'll tell you what I like;Time of the Season 3Your Move (live version on VH-1 smokes the version on cd)3I Am A Rock 3Sound of Silence 3California Dreamin' (until distracting, loud, out of place guitar solo makes me fast forward or turn off)2.75I might put the songs above in my ipod but I most probably will never listen to the rest of this cd again. BUT...I still rock out to Cyclorama."
negative,"for teen-age girls only: this is one of those books picked by people who still wish they were young. it is a good book for prepubescent or teen-age girls and not for anyone else. there are lots of these floating around, after all this one is over 60. they should normally quietly fade away, till someone unearths the moldy carcass for it to rise again, and quickly sink into the oblivion from which it came"
negative,"Duff, duff, duff.: After the appalling ""Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency"", (mostly recycled from an unfinished Dr. Who script Adams wrote), we have the Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul. Possibly the worst novel Adams has written, (although the last two HitchHikers books are pretty bad), it has no redeemming features whatsoever. Duff, duff, duff."
negative,"Sharp Looking Engine: This is the only train we have encountered with a ""reset"" button underneath which my son finds more interesting than the train itself. Now the bells and whistles go but the train does not. Why in the world did they put that button there when there are already 4 buttons on top? And yes, it does drain those batteries quick!"
negative,"TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME: I bought the book even after I read all the negative reviews, but guess what? They were all right!!! This book is a complete waste of time, it's just a blog, it should have been just a short story, because it's not entertaining, it's not special, the writer is just an egocentric woman with no direction and worst of all, with no writing skills.Please, go buy something else, and don't waste your time with this book.If you want really entertaining books about cooking, chefs, etc., buy something by Anthony Bourdain! He does rock!"
positive,Takayuki Kubota: Functional Karate is a very good source of useful techniques that are used by law enforcement from around the world on a daily basis. Takayuki Kubota presents everything in a clear fashion so viewers are able to see techniques in detail as they are broken down and demonstrated. He shows step by step how to joint lock and use pain compliance to subdue an attacker along with many other things. He shows how to deal with the untrained street fighter's hooking punches in a safe and effective manner and he speaks of his philosophy of neverending karate which means to strike and strike again until you've won which I'm sure all martial artist's would agree is the proper approach. This is a very good production that any martial artist would love to add to his or her personal collection. Kubota's techniques are used worldwide so the effectiveness of them speaks for itself.Jeff MillerShohei-ryu karatedo
negative,"wow, what a mess: If you read the Beats and about the Beats, you're eventually going to come to William S. Burroughs. He's very much a voice of the 1950s, post World War II. He was into the drugs, longer and harder and deeper than anyone else. He was into shocking the squares and living off the pathetic working class zombies. And it's all there on the page, man. A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars. It's convoluted, drug paranoia with a created mythology about time and space travel that's all about shocking images of sex and death. It's not a story."
negative,"I waited 6 years for this!!??: I would like to begin by saying I have read and thoroughly enjoyed the entire ""Clan"" series. That was up until ""Shelters of Stone"". I was almost entirely let down by this book due to the fact that I waited almost 6 years to read the next saga in Ayla's life. The book seemed to lacked the heart and soul of the other books, especially ""Valley of Horses"". I felt like she almost didn't know what to write about and all the characters and description, including Jondalar,Wolf, the horses, and even the food that had been such a big part of the previous 3 books, were forgotten about and she was trying to build and/or change Ayla into almost another character. I did enjoy the ending and I was starting to get into it. Maybe the next book will be better; here's to hoping for the next 6 years!!"
positive,"Sublime: This book serves as a sublime introduction to the mystical side of Christianity - the Christian way originating in the centuries following Christ and surviving to this day, having been preserved in the remote and secluded monasteries of Eastern Orthodox Greece. The author, having been educated in the United States, had followed the path of many of his contemporaries and participated in zen meditation and other new-age spiritual movements in the West. On a whim he decides to re-examine Christianity, traveling to a remote corner of Greece and discovering an ancient Christian tradition unknown to the western Christians of today. Within this tradition, guided by enlightended spiritual elders, he discovers the practices required to achieve 'Theosis', or union with God. Containing a wealth of miraculous and inspiring stories, Kyriacos Markides investigates this Way of the Saints, what he calls - The threefold way."
negative,"used package almost empty: Unfortunately, I have bought an used box (on Amazon it was written that all pieces were there), but when I opened the box I realized that it was almost empty, so it was not usable."
negative,"Like wet sand in my underwear.: This movie was good: good like catching a soup-plate in the throat at high velocity. Beyond the cheesy special effects (and if you thought they were good I have a lovely ""pong"" game I could sell you), all the viewer is left with is an empty feeling where good acting should have been. I also have to equate its script content with an adult-form Barney movie in its diluted attempt at entertainment. It was scary alright. Scary inasmuch as the masses opinion that ""the mummy"" was more fun than self-mutilation. I just wonder exactly how much the entertainment business will have to eat before it explodes from overconsumption. Heaven help us if this movie was intended to be ""good""."
positive,"Born with the blues: The blues is more than a musical genre; it is (was) for many people, what they were born into. As much as I enjoy modern artists, with modern instruments, using modern techniques; I know that they, at best, are trying to copy a raw emotion. This CD is that raw emotion; this is the blues as performed by someone born into the blues. As quoted (on a CD title also) Fred will tell you ""I don't play no rock & roll"". What Fred plays comes from the depths of his being and he sings and plays what he feels; not what he thinks you might like to hear. So if you want to hear the blues, sung and played as it is felt; listen to this man."
positive,dad!! davids got the code!: okk soo. i just wanna know if anyone knows what gary says when they are at school like after i think its after he has alreayd been beaten up by marky? but he goes... something like.. 'talk to travis pickle yet?' but thats tottally not what he says!!! anyone know!?
negative,"a bundle of irritation: This, more even than its predecessors, is a lazy game that swaps challenge for mere irritation. Players will run off in all directions without reason, and stop, pause, and turn the wrong way to miss key passes or interceptions; will take ten yards (no joke) to stop from a run; will simply ignore a clear pass to an open player, and substitute a silly pass to a distant player on the opposite side of the pitch; and a through-ball, if too good, will magically speed up halfway through (no joke), in order to get to the keeper before an onrushing forward. In other words, EA couldn't be bothered to develop a clever game - instead, in order to make it competitive, they made it arbitrary, disingenuous, and utterly stupid."
negative,"Classic movie: Movie was good but the delivery was poor. Movie feed continuously stopped & started, So far not a fan of the service"
positive,"Buy It!: The first movie in the series is good, but, Road Warrior is better. but does that mean it`s bad? Heck no! This is actually one of the best of the sci-fi genre.It`s about this guy named Max, (duh!) who gets pissed at this motorcycle gang for killing his friend and family and seeks his hellish revenge."
positive,"Heartwarming: Louisa May Alcott's 'Little Women' is one of the most captivating and heartfelt stories I have ever read. This is the story of four sisters, living at an unstable time in American history, who learn to overcome poverty and selfish wants to become mature and accomplished women. Their triumphs will bring a smile to your face, while their trials will bring you tears. The March sisters will win their way into your mind and heart, and their story is one you will not soon forget."
negative,"I dissent. I thought it was tedious.: It just didn't hit the spot for me. I found the whole religious thing to be irrelevant. The exoctic mystical eastern religious fascination came across as being dated to me, a bit of a hippy/60s thing. And because of that, I was not really motivated to suspend my disbelief. It all seemed like magic rather than science, and therefore just a bit silly. If the story and the characters had resonated with me, maybe I would have liked all the battles and action at the end, but it all came across as a bit Bruce Willis-esque.I did like the line ""the fit hit the Shan"", though."
positive,Not the best but good enough.: These are not the best condoms I ever had but they do the job. Good enough for a fair price.
positive,A Christmas Carol: A very good read and a good opportunity to reflect upon the true meaning of the Christmas season. Recommended for readers of all ages.
positive,"sibling rivalry killer: A great movie to help kids learn the importance of supporting their siblings, especially those involved in competitive activities. And great source for historical fiction."
negative,"Leaky!!: These leak about every other time my baby poops. I purchased them accidentally thinking I was getting the Swaddlers. Will NEVER buy these again, just terrible!!"
positive,Solid popcorn flick: Ignore all the haters. It's still giant robots from space fighting each other. Enough said. On par with the first movie and better than the second one.
positive,"better than you might think: Okay, I'll admit straight off that this is my ""guilty pleasure"" CD; I don't usually go for Top 40 groups. However, I was able to get past the extreme popularity of ""Absolutely"", because this CD, while not startling original in any way, is a cheerful, aurally pleasing piece of work. Don't look to Nine Days for intellectual lyrics or anything, but realize that every song on this album is really catchy, musically well-written, and fun to listen to when you're in the mood for something light. I think that these guys still have a long way to go in terms of being legendary, creative musicians (for instance, ditching the boy-band-esque pictures plastered all over the CD might be a good idea), but they've managed to produce a really nice collection here."
positive,"Loving Ocean Wonders!: This has been so much help in getting my baby to go to sleep on her own. We play it every night. Now that she is 14 months old, she will play it herself when she wakes up in the middle of the night and it sooths her back to sleep. I LOVE IT!"
negative,Did not work in my Lumix: The battery I was sent did not work in my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K digital camera.
negative,"Buy CRUISERS instead; these leak too easily.: I bought a pack of the Baby Dry diapers for what I thought would be for night-time use and use our Cruiser subscription for day use. We have a 20-mos boy and we do not like the Baby Dry at all; my son has woken up a few times with urine soaked shirts and shorts so aside from being unhygenic, these diapers just lack the quality or thickness that the Cruisers are so we'll be cancelling our subscription for them. LOVE CRUISERS for day and overnight use though."
negative,"Very Very........: Very, very violent.Violence for the sake of violence.Very, very bloody.They really have a good time with the obviously fake blood squirting everywhere like mini-geysers.Very, very Low-Budget.You can actually make a better movie with 3 friends and 20 bux.Very, very not-so-special effects.Water pressure, paper machie, & red-dye.Very, very riduculous plot.1 gang of unkillabe goons, vs. 1 gang involved in zombie experiments.Everything about this movie is very.And I mean very.Ver, veryMORAL OF THE STORY:More is less......alot less."
negative,"Can't believe the publisher had nerve to issue this book: A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to ""speak Irish"" but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing."
positive,"Finally, A Good Book!: I'm not much on writing long reviews, but I thought this little book was worth it because it helped me. Finally, of the few books out there regarding what to expect during basic training, this book is the best and most current. I've read the other two (including Mr. Thompson's first edition) and can say with certainty this book (2nd edition) is highly informative and insightful. You can even e-mail the author for more info. The best advice, don't trust just one book or just one source for your information.I ended up not enlisting for full time service, but still considering the Reserves. I'm glad I had this book to make an informed decision.Good luck if you are going in!"
negative,"Haunting.....sort of: The newly updated film version of Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is somewhat acceptable. If your looking for some good effects and a strong character lead, ""The Haunting"" is your cup of tea. For the rest of us who want something scary, ""The Haunting"" was definitely not it. For the first hour of the movie, it's creepy and fun as we explore the house along with the actors. But as the second half begins to roll, ""The Haunting"" loses steam. If your a person who enjoys the sights and sounds of a high budget film, buy ""The Haunting"". But for those who want class in their horror flicks, definitely leave this one out of the collection."
positive,"Don't let this band sneak by: This band rocks, smooth vocals by Greg Giuferia and production by Gene Simmons...a solid combination that merits your attention if you're a serious rock fan."
negative,"Not his best: 4 boyhood friends meet each year to go hunting at Beav's cabin, Hole in the Wall. Each is having difficulties in their lives and look forward to the hunting trip. But this year, a man stumbles into their lives and the cabin, missing teeth and time and carrying a frightening parasite that not even he knows about.This is not King at his best, but as he wrote this book while recovering from his near-fatal car accident, it is wonderful that he has written again, period. The book is frightening and, at time, gross. There are flashes of King brilliance in this book, but a lot of the 700+ pages are taken up with sub-plots and routine stuff that could have been left out of the book. I rejoice that Mr. King is still around and still writing - and recommend this book only half-heartedly."
negative,"Old information. Need new edition!!: I had thought that my 5 years old loves this book as the pictures are big and great along with the information..... Yes, information is very important for those ages since they observe very quickly. First, we need updated information on it. This book was published 2001. During the course of this past decade, there have been so many changes happened. I take my boy to Smithonian Air and Space museum and he naturally learned the updated information. In matter fact, my boy pointed out some of it. For example, 'Black Hawk' has been retired long time ago. (but this book says that the plane is active so as Space Shuttle.) If you are looking for the kids who loves airplanes, but not looking for the aculate information beside the great photos, this will be a wonderful book. If DK makes updated edition, it would be GREAT."
positive,"Great gift: I bought this particular zen garden for my younger sister because she enjoyed the one I had so much. I love the tools that come with it. The only problem I had with mine was one of the small feet came off from the bottom. My younger sister was very happy to receive this, but hasn't said anything beyond that."
negative,"Nirvana is awesome; but home demos of great songs played with terrible quality and instruments isn't: Although it does not mention it that the songs on the CD are demos in track listing, almost single song on this CD is cheap home made demos with terrible sound quality, with the exception of a few acoustic and live performances. If you want to buy Nirvana's greatest hits and enjoy the studio quality sounds and recordings of the ones of the best bands in alt rock history, this is not your album and do not be tricked like I was."
positive,Neil Sedaka always good.: The CD is clear and crisp.The only reason I gave it 4 stars was I did not care for some of the songs. I did buy it for certain songs so I shouldn't complain. The price is right so you really can't go wrong.
positive,Peggy Sue got Married: I have another friend who wanted this movie and could not find it and asked me to look to see if I could get it. She explained the movie to me so I knew what to look for and the details of the movie and the listing that was given when I ordered it was great. and I received it very quickly.
positive,"Good strings for a good price.: The First Act guitar strings is a good product for the money, I hate spending 15, 20 or even 25 buckson guitar strings when the sound quality isint that much different than 25$ strings and as a musiciani change my strings frequently so spending less is always smarter in my opinion unless your a die-hardfan of some other brand. For the price and sound quality First Act Acoustic/Electric guitar stringsis the best bang for your buck!"
negative,"Unimpressed: I purchased these at Baby's R Us because of the good reviews, but I have not had any luck with them. They didn't pull the nipple out far enough to make any difference, and the pressure on the nipple made me leak constantly. I would soak through a cloth pad in a couple of hours. They are suppose to have a reservoir to catch the milk, but your nipple must protrude a certain distance in order for the shell to work. My nipples were too flat, so I just ended up with wet, smelly breasts.They are also very large and extremely noticeable - there is no way I would wear them in public.I also think a previous reviewer got the medela shell types mixed up. This shell does not have a foam insert, and is hard plastic."
negative,"Very Christian!: I wish had thought to check out the reviews on a site such as this BEFORE I bought the book. Considering this is a work which is supposedly meant to help people overcome toxic anger, I imagine many people feel even more angry upon discovering the very heavy Christian slant of the book."
positive,very informative: I found this book very informative on the subject of Cairn Terriers. Probably the only one needed. It's detail makes it ideal for use as a handbook and the many colored pictures a pleasure to read and see. It includes product suggestions as well. I found I still needed more information concerning training than what was covered in this book.
negative,"Numerous transcription errors in Kindle edition: While Ross is an excellent writer and I hate to leave a review that nit-picks the format rather than the content, I think it's useful for those considering buying the Kindle edition to be warned that the digital text has numerous obvious copy errors, seemingly created when scanning the book: ""candles"" become ""candies"", ""corn"" becomes ""com"", etc., over and over throughout the book. It's usually easy to work out what the word should have been, but it's very distracting and breaks the flow of the text."
negative,"DVD was not playable.: Apparently, different countries have different codes in a DVD player. I thought all DVDs were the same. I was so excited to get the movie, but so disappointed I could not play it. It would've cost the price of the movie just to ship it back, so I just had to throw it out. That was a waste of money."
positive,"Great read!: Somehow I've never managed to read this book, even in school. I'd seen it for years in the library, but was always turned off by the title/cover. To be honest, I didn't even know what it was about. However, the minute I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! With interesting themes and characters, this is definitely a must-read classic!"
positive,"Provides excellent knowledge about Tibetan Medicine: ITem was shipped new and arrived in excellent condition. DVD provides a beginning knowledge about the almost lost art regarding Tibetan Medicine. As indicated in the DVD, there are very few doctors that still retain this knowledge and practice. Excellent overview but it is all in subtitles and obtaining any of the medicines/herbs seems as though it would be difficult. They take a wholistic approach and specialize the medicines for the person. You would need to go to India to get a diagnosis regarding your condition. Too bad it is not closer."
negative,"iWhat's the big idea!: I've heard all the albums, seen them live, and all I can say is ""Phish-Lite"". I'm glad that they are doing what they are doing, but they wear their influences on their sleeve."
positive,"The Sacketts/ Crossfire Trail: As always we received the DVD's in record time from USA. Both DVD's were excellent and as they were from Louis L'Amour's books which my husband has all of his books, we did enjoy the films.We like buying off Amazon as we know we will get a good product.Thank You"
positive,"an exciting classic that keeps up suspence: It was a great book but really confusing. I started with the 'wishbone' version so when I read the unabridged version I understood it much better. This is a MUST READ classic if you like pirate adventure, excitement, and suspence."
negative,"Poor writing and research, very weak.: As I was reading this book I felt the author's premise was downright silly. She uses biological research to make incomplete and overly simplistic arguments to support her view that women are superior to men. I think she misjudged the reading public in taking what she - or the publishers- thought would be a popular political/social position that would sell books, especially to women. Honestly, I felt this book was so poor that I was too embarrassed to put it on my bookshelf."
negative,"A Little Lemon In Your Coffee: This coffeemaker quit working less than 6 month after I recieved it. While they were quick to send a replacement,it also quit working in about 4 months. Stupid me never sent the cupholder back with the first one. How could I possibly get 2 bad units in a year? My first single cup Keurig worked for a year and a half and still works for my daughter.Live and learn. Back to my dependable Bunn. Coffee isn't as good by far,but it beats no coffee at all."
positive,The cold war: Well written book I ever read. Highly recommended for people interested in modern 20th century.
negative,"visual irritation: I bought this video grouped with ""The Call"" (another awful video). I am not impressed. These are the worst animation videos I have ever seen and am baffled as to how they made it on dvd.This one is better than ""The Call"" but I still wish I had not bought it. I feel fooled by the cover art and the other customer reviews."
negative,"A Perfect Edition for the Pre-Schooler or Developmentally Challenged Adult: The Elements of Style is, hands down, my favorite book of English usage. It is as pure and simple and perfect as a reference book can be. That is, simple, not simple-minded.This much lauded illustrated edition, with its simple-minded illustrations, is yet another sad example of the dumbing down of western culture. In Will Strunk's time this sort of treatment, if it existed at all, would have been intended for children below the age of six or seven. It's current target reader is apparently the developmentally challenged adult. While we all sympathize with those struggling with learning disabilities, it is pathetic that such a degradation of a classic work is received with respect. My four year old grandson finds the illustrations to be as he says, ""pretty stupid"". Of course, he is a child of normal intelligence, and is thus at a critical disadvantage in a world designed for the lowest common denominator."
positive,"Insightful. Accurate. Every Christian needs to read this book!: In trying to reach out to our modern culture, we've become so concerned with tailoring worship services to attract the worshiper and suit his schedule and tastes that we've neglected to focus on Almighty God - the proper object of our worship. John MacArthur reminds us that the reason for worship is NOT that we should RECEIVE a blessing, but that we should GIVE honor, glory, blessing and devotion to our Lord. Not only do I keep a copy of this book on my shelf, but I have given copies of it to my children!"
positive,"Clay's CD: I honestly didn't think the CD would be as good as it is. I did expect great, but this is awesome. First time I have listened to a CD all the way through. Even if he didn't write the songs, he sounds like he means every word. Excellent Album!!! KEEP IT UP CLAY!"
positive,as advertised: It was the product my daughter needed for school. I find the book binding rather flimsy but it doesn't need to survive longer than her course and it wasn't expensive so I can't complain.
negative,"Nice rack, but: Make sure your bike will fit the rack. They have a chart to make sure rack fits car but not that your bike will fit rack. I have two Treck Pures. They won't work on this rack."
negative,"Effects can't help this disaster: I thought the effects and the extra footage in this movie would redeem it. They didn't. It's a disaster, and I now hate Brendan Fraser even more than I did before. This one's going straight to Ebay."
positive,very useful book: Bought for school. It was a little rough being used and all. But it still works good and has a lot of really good information.
positive,"Informative and entertaining to read: For the fact that the book was written just a few years after Li's death, information was fresh and probably quite accurate. I just wish that the book has a lot more photos. I enjoyed reading it."
positive,"Why this cd doesn't have more songs?: The mayority of the people assume that IKON took only influences from Joy Division, I think this band worships Dead in June's work. Two examples ""Fall Apart"" and ""Distant Memory"".I'd love to listen this songs with a real drummer."
negative,"Ridiculously biased: This purports to be an objective examination of the principles of economics. Instead, it's a load of conservatively biased economics propaganda - without even a mention of opposing views. Dangerously influential, considering that it is used as a text for Introductory Economics at places like Harvard and University of Chicago."
negative,"If you have already watched trasformer 1, don't spend your time to watch this, even it is free.: If you watch trasformer 1, don't spend your time to watch this, even it is free. I consider this movie is just below the episode 2 and the 2 below 1. And nothing is new."
positive,"Excellent!: Just what I was looking for in an orchestration book, the translated words of Rimsky-Korsakov. Great price, nice cover and durability."
positive,"Unlike the First: Celtic music has always been one of my favorite genres of music. After listening to Enam's first CD for years, I finally was able to listen to his second CD and was moved. His sophisticated touch to his songs have risen to another level and was taken by surprise. Compared to his first CD, his music has become more ""emotional"" and deep to the point that it reaches the heart. The varieties of instruments have not changed and the soundscape of his work is simply moving."
positive,"Shredded packaging: The bike was every thing advertised and more. It was delivered promptly, but the box was in shreds thank goodness by some miracle everything stayed inside and assembly was a snap."
negative,"Good basic story, but many flaws: I found the basic idea of the book to be excellent and very true to life, however, I cannot say the same for the characters, Felicia in particular. Beyond her frustration, we are never privy to any of her emotions. What did she think of her plight? Why did she never worry that Johnny, her lover, might reject her? I feel that the author made a mistake by never writing in Felicia's viewpoint during her scenes with Mr. Hilditch. We certainly know many of his feeling and thoughts concerning Felicia, but never, never any of her thoughts about her sinister friend. ...The character of Mr. Hilditch is very well developed, unfortunately more so than the main character. I felt that too much of the book (one quarter) was devoted to Mr. Hilditch's downward spiral. It almost becomes a completely different story.As a previous reviewer mentioned, the author's practice on going back and the forth between past and present was confusing."
positive,"moking religeon! , I like it.: this book should be worshiped as the bilble so that I dont have to go to church. the reason this book was so funny is becouse jokes are funnier writen down."
negative,"Pointless Movie!!: I was sold when I saw how many ratings this proclaimed 5 star movie it had received but to my disappointment, it was just a waste of time and money. If you really want to see a good movie about a piano or pianist with a good story to it then I recommend ""The Piano"".This movie was somewhat sickening and pointless. There was no real good story behind the movie. Just 2 puzzling demented sicko's who's only purpose was to make you vomit and throw that movie away. I'd like to give a synopsis about the movie but the truth is, is that there's really no good plot to talk about a synopsis.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You'll save time and money. Not all 5 star movies have earned their stars."
negative,Bad experience....: I bougth this gun hooping to get my job done.The first one had some proplems in sinking staples so a returned.They send a second one and rigth out the box i tried and for my surprise something was wrong with the safety so the gun did not shoot.I did send the second one back and amazon is going to send my money back.I dont know if is problems with the factory bad quality produtcs or i'm having bad luck.I will wait to buy another one. Ricardo.(my job still not done).
negative,"Cheap Chinese crap: I bought it, looked at it and sent it back. 1st flaw: made in china 2nd flaw: the case is not mounted to the sharpener base so the uncentered tumbler knocks it off and it causes a huge distraction in class 3rd flaw: it doesn't sharpen worth a sht, what happened to quality?! Don't buy this foreign piece of crap"
negative,No Active Table of Contents: My rating is only for the electronic formatting of this book. I really feel like I don't have any right to complain since the book was free but -you get what you pay for.The book starts with an introduction to the story which goes on for 18% of the book file. The actual text of the book doesn't start until location 604-10. Unfortunately the only way to find this is to page through from the beginning. It would have been nice to have a table of contents or at least a bookmaark for the start of the actual book.
positive,Excellent Price and Volume Study: Price and volume tell the tale for what is happening with a stock. The auther provides an excellent course on how to read the price ad volume action of a stock. No need for fancy wiz-bang technical indicators if you can read the tape.Get this book. Combine with all of Bill O'Neils books and you have a great foundation.
positive,"BEAUTIFUL: I bought these for my nursery 2 years ago. They have held up nicely, the length/width was good as they fit my windows and still are able to pucker like they need too. They are absolutely perfect! I strongly recommend them."
negative,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA: I'm sorry if any of you teen enjoy this lispy southern high school reject like 'em but i think it's all crap...don't get me wrong, i appreciate all forms of music and clay does have an ok singing voice but his style belongs on broadway doing a musical...he would be the BEST Sandra Dee on Grease i'm sure...it's funny to me how you can all like him because of a show..."
negative,"Unneccessarily Bad Language: Unneccessarily bad language comes out of no where in the middle of this documentary. Not what I expected in a PBS documentary. For someone expecting to be shocked, this is for you. Adults only language. Be warned."
negative,"I read it.: I wouldn't recommend it. Pick a topic. Insert ""but then the Christians......"". Repeat. The author us ckear that there is not a lot of source material to support his position. So ultimately it is a work of historical fiction."
positive,"Theme gifts: I discovered these beautiful little gems at the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater restaurant at Walt Disney World in Florida. In a darkened atmosphere like the Sci-Fi Restaurant, these cubes show up great.I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests. Use lots of candlelight during your party rather than overhead lighting to provide a ""darkened environment."" Litecubes are economical and will certainly provide entertainment for your guests.This would be a five-star product if the batteries would provide more than 10-12 hours of use. Figure on using them for 3-5 cocktail parties before replacing them. Batteries are not replaceable (unless you have the capacity to reseal the Litecubes). Store your litecubes in the refrigerator to slow the battery's decay."
negative,"Predicatable: At least the sex scenes aren't as numerous as in The Mammoth Hunters or Plains of Passage!This is a predicatable sequel with no real eye-openers. It all works out the way you figure it will. There were extremely repetitive parts (if I have to read one more time about how amazing everyone is by Ayla and her animals, I will scream) and some parts were just too easy-not enough conflict.That said, it was a light, interesting read. Wait till it's in paperbackNothing will every beat Clan of the Cave Bear."
negative,"hmmm...: This film is shot beautifully and I liked the way the actors were allowed to meander around in their character to sort of ""make the movie themselves"" as they went along. Unfortunately the movie is made to be ""About"" the ""last days"" of Kurt Cobain. This movie is not accurate and falls short in paying ANY kind of tribute to the memory of Kurt. It distorts his memory if it does any thing which is sad. I enjoy the quiet scenes and all the mood shots, it's a neat reflective film and is actually comedic at times once you take away any reference there might be to Kurt Cobain. I had to MUTE the volume during the scene where the character tries to sing and play like Kurt. Other than that, like I said I like the way the film is shot and made and would have enjoyed it if it did not have something supposedly to do with Kurt Cobain. Any way, that's what I have to say."
negative,"NOT Drawn...: Many reviews led me to believe this book would be inspirational... but I just found myself thinking that Sara Hall was the most histrionic writer that I have read in years... her approach to her children was deplorable, her constant perseveration and use of unnecessary language made the book difficult to finish. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
negative,Horrible for everyone but the dog!: Bought this to deter the dog from chewing our couch.. Waste of money! Now we have to buy a new couch-he may have chewed more because of this! And once its sprayed you can never get the taste out of your mouth or off your hands! Still can't touch the couch! It is impossible to get the spray-taste off your hands! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! We used about half the bottle on our couch and still had to throw it out-only bitter to us not the dog!
negative,"not impressed: Not impressed, slow moving and not a plot I was happy to watch. Expected something more exciting, but fell far short in my opinion."
negative,"Cat Claw Scratcher: Could not get our cat to even think about using it. It just sits there taking up space until I decide to throw it out, or maybe find a neighbor that I could give it away to who has a kitten that could figure out what it's for and use it. But sadly, my older cat won't."
positive,"Beautiful.: This story is beautiful and haunting. It is so very human and so much more adult than the Narnia series, yet still has something childlike in its portrayal of love, family, and heartbreak.The myth of Cupid and Psyche is somewhat well known. C.S. Lewis mixes classical Greek elements drawn directly from the myth with an almost tribal sense of spirituality and a fairy-tale setting to tell a wonderfully unique and thought-provoking story from the point of view of Psyche's sister.We feel firsthand the heartbreak and intensity of first love, family love, betrayal, and loneliness. This story draws fewer allegories than Lewis' other fiction (Narnia, Out of Silent Planet trilogy, Screwtape) and instead is a powerful story from a wonderful storyteller which is much more subtle in its morals and questions of life. A must read."
positive,"Just what it ought to have been: Fantastic. Yeah, it could have been longer, and they could have included more, but just to get so many, such heartfelt interviews with Roger, David, Nick and Rick is worth it alone.Plus, they found a really wide assortment of people who knew Syd, and I found their stories really fascinating and touching - seems Syd touched everybody around him."
positive,"Smells great: Product smells great, and does not leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy. Bought this because I recently had my hair chemically straightened and want to keep it as shiny as possible."
positive,"""Combination"": This combines Nelly's successful Sweat and Suit albums to make Sweatsuit. There are great songs on here including Grillz. This is a great song and a very popular song. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes rap and hip-hop."
positive,"A true Disney Masterpiece.: This was the first Disney movie I watched as a child.I would still watch it today. Disney successfully humanizes the movie to children by using ""friendly"" animals, while still keeping the main storylines intact.Thumbs up to the music; ""Love Goes On and On"" is a moving piece, and even hits my hard heart.Parents with younger children be warned: Some scenes may frighten them."
positive,"I couldn't forget it: I LOVED IT! I won't write anything else because you'll just have to read it yourself. Also, I don't have time, because I'm off to read it again!"
positive,"It just gets better: All the characters (actors)play their roles perfectly. Like the above review, I know families and people like the Gallaghers. They exist, but to act it and make it believeable is another thing. William Macy, I have seen many of his movies and to be able to have his character in this series make me forget his other roles is the sign of a very, very talented man. They don't give Oscars for TV show actors, but he deserves one. He nails it, I have a friend who I went to school with and now at 59 years old could be Franks twin. Not sure if the writers of this show may have met my friend. Macy plays it to perfection. The series is excellent, the acting very believable and I am always saying, ""I know poeple who act like that"". Buy it, and enjoy, this one is a winner."
negative,WASTE OF MONEY!!!: I was so excited when I found out that they were coming out with Law & Order Criminal Intent but it turned out to be a BIG dissapointment. After installing the game and watching the beginning scene the game just stopped working after that. The entire screen was black and all I saw were the characters. I know I have the latest version of Direct X because all of my Sims games require it but that didn't matter the game still refused to work properly. Save your money and buy yourself something thats actually worth it!
negative,"Mullets across the Med: I don't see why the producers bothered making this movie. It adds nothing to the Kirk Douglas version of Ulysses made in 1955, besides a few limited CGI effects. Even Douglas's beard was preferable to Assante's mullet hairstyle in this version. This has stripped out all of the sex and most of the violence that is in the original Homer.What we have here is a TV movie made in 4x3 format back in 1997, but finally released on DVD in 2004 to cash in on the 'TROY' blockbuster. It was made to be acceptable to the US TV market, but I suspect the production team was European.To my knowledge, there has yet to be a good film/TV adaptation of the Odyssey. The best dramatisation so far is a recent audiobook dramatisation by the BBC starring Tim McInerney."
negative,"Laborious, wearisome, boring: Too many unnecessary details - a chore to read. Was reading this with a group of 8th graders and we couldn't wait to get done with it - no one liked it. Too many times after reading a page, we would all go - HUH?? - what did the author just say?You know there have been more novels written since then- why do students have to keep reading the same ones their grandparents read when they were in school?"
positive,"As Good As You Remember: Some childhood pieces don't hold up after all these years (I'm thinking about HR. Pufnstuf and co). But this does. A great production is captured here and the songs, moral, and plot are as lively as you remember. I'd recommend this to anyone who loved it as a kid- you won't be disappointed."
positive,"Very Good & Entertaining!: I saw this movie when it first came out in '88, it's still alot of fun to watch 24 years later."
positive,"Wonderful writing: This is a remarkably well-written book, and a compellingly good read---quite an accomplishment given that there isn't a single likable character in it, not even the housekeeper."
positive,"Let love in: In the city of Oran, something very bad is happening. Albert Camus' The Plague is a masterwork of 20th century literature as it examines the devestating effects of a deadly and bloody plague that breaks out all over the city. In the wake of a quarantine, Dr. Rieux and a handful of survivors band together to do what they can. In the long run, the only thing that any of them can really do to overcome the odds, is live. Though there are times when it is drawn out, The Plague manages to deliver an incredibly compelling story that examines human nature in the wake of incredible adversity, and it has never been done better since. The shocking imagery and perspectives presented here only further show Camus' mastery, and the equally shocking poignancy will surprise you even more so. Definitely not for everyone, The Plague is a masterpiece."
positive,"Extraordinarily important: The fact that this book is written by a relatively unknown writer and published by a solid, but non-establishment publishing company means that few people have or will hear about it. That's too bad, because it is almost painfully well reported, carefully argued, and thoroughly packed with facts, not opinions. It is a shocker, a real shocker. Taylor lays bare the double-talk and obfuscation that so thickly covers the issue of race in America, but he does so without rhetoric, even though his editorial point of view is both clear and determined. The never-before-told stories of ordinary people both black and white who have suffered under our thirty year regime of political correctness and blindness in the area of race, make this book hauntingly powerful."
negative,Mindless dribble: I've read almost all of Ed Greenwoods works and I really have to say that this series wins the cake on the worst one yet. It starts out with promise but the further you get in the book the more it seems to insult your intelligence. The main characters mainly go through this one and the next two just fighting an endless host of people with swords and magic. Through pure luck they continually win and if they get beat someone comes along and saves them at the last minute. There is really no plot development and it gets way too mind numbing. I made the mistake of reading the next two out of boredom and kept hoping that something would happen. IT NEVER DID!!! Even if you love Ed Greenwood please avoid this series.
positive,"Awesome product!: I've had an older revision of this charger for many years. It's a lot better than those ""trickle chargers"" and is even powerful to start a small car! (barely)"
positive,"This Movie Is A Comedy Gem!!!: This movie was made Trey Parker and Matt Stone who achieved great suceess with their South Park series. This movie is VERY FUNNY from the outset when Matt reveals his intentions to Trey as they arrive at a girl's party. Later they are seen having a good time in (unknown to them) the girl's mother's bedroom.The jokes come hard and fast and a highlight is when Trey and Matt try to ""outpsyche"" their baseketball opponents. I give this movie 5 stars because it is guaranteed to offend some people which means that is it tastless, crude, vulgar BUT very funny which is just what a good comedy should be."
positive,"Yawn...: Zen meditation could be called a state of heightened awareness (although that's not quite accurate). This music induces here a state of heightened drowsiness. Although not unpleasant to listen to by any means, I do find it rather sleep-inducing and hypnotic -- a bit too serious, and dare I say, almost boring?If you want to actually do zazen, no music is necessary or particularly helpful... pay attention to the breath and be aware of thoughts arising. Otherwise, this music could be interesting to listen to purely as a sort of relaxation or enjoyment -- from that basis, it's not bad... if you like improvisational stuff (is it 'art'?). A step further in the direction of ""interesting"" might include Riley Lee, Uttara-Kuru, Kokin Gumi, even Kitaro..."
negative,"Not great for newborns.: I first tried these when my son was 4 weeks old. Pampers SWADDLERS are MUCH better. I bought a huge package of these and I wish I hadn't. First of all they always leak. My son will fill up one of these diapers in no time and he always leaks pee out the sides and up his back. Second, because they don't hold much liquid, his poops also spill out. They leak poop up his back and around his legs (and he does not have skinny legs. He was born 9 pounds.) The diapers aren't that soft either and they have caused my son to get diaper rash. I assume its due to the fact that they're not very absorbent and that they're not that soft. I absolutely hate these diapers. I usually like Pampers brand, but I have huggies and Luvs diapers that I like better than these. I plan to just send them to his daycare and let them deal with them and I'll use diapers I like better at home."
negative,"Awesome Film, Terrible Quality DVD (Slim Case): This cartoon is fantastic, but beware that the slim case version is of terrible quality. I came across it at a dollar store and was delighted to have replaced my VHS copy. Unfortunately, this particular version is completely washed out and the audio has a constant hiss. I presume that the other DVD version is better, but who knows? I guess I'll be going back to the trusty tape."
negative,"An Ok Movie - But Not Martin Scorsese's Best- BY FAR!: Let me start off by saying I'm without a doubt the BIGGEST fan of Robert De Niro & Martin Scorsese! Without a doubt this film has a superb cast and a superb director, but lacks a storyline.Mean Streets is a story about a group of gangsters in NYC, who for the most part, dont even cause any crimes. The ending is so horrible, it dropped my rating *1/2 stars.Robert De Niro & Harvey Keitel give oscar worthy performances. GO FIGURE! A bad movie - but they really do make the movie. Keitel's best performance EVER!..."
negative,Don't bother: Pure junk. Poor fit and poor adjustment. Both belts are entirely too long except perhaps for an exceptionally obese person. Stiff canvas and poor fit make this vest unacceptable for almost any activity...even walking.
negative,"What were they thinking?: Queen does Disco. Yuck.The only decent songs here are ""Body Language"" and ""Under Pressure."" Both of which you can find on various compilations. Don't waste your money on this garbage."
negative,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you want to pass WinArch I & II: This book doesn't cover the information that will be tested. You will need massive amounts of additional research and materials to pass the WinArch I & II. I would have rated it zero stars if I could.
negative,"Bad,Bad,BAD!: after reading some of the other Hulk books like boling point, Abominal,Ground zero, and Dogs of war I saw this at a book storeand thought the hulk in his early dayes are proboly no diffrent from the books I read so I bought it. Big mistake. The green hulk does talk and like a complete idiot too. Was that freak the Leader? I don't think so. Bruce Banners now dead wife Betty actedlike a idiot. One star becouse The Hulk and Abomination have a cool fight in this but it's not even that good. If you are looking for somethin were the hulk and Abomination fight get Abominal, In that Bruce meet's the Abomination's aboused wife. Better yet, get the Tv series."
negative,bigguy: Love the razor but the price of the blades is hard to believe. Four blaeds for $17.00 they don't last any longer than any other blade. I had a $2.00 coupon & still couldn't get myself to buy them.
negative,Barely made it through: I finished this book only because I had to. Pages and pages describing a single grain of sand. Not for me.
negative,"HP should recall or offer full refunds to purchaser's of the HP2575 inkjet printer: I expected much more from the ""all in one"" HP2575 inkjet based on my experience using HP Office laser printer products. In fact, I'm still using a 15yr old HP laser B&W; printer daily. Before this bad experience with the HP2575 I wouldn't have purchase anything but HP printer's. I've been very satisfied with all my network HP laser printer's used at the office. That being said my personal home HP2575 inkjet failed after appox 3 years of very low usage. It no longer scans or prints yet troubleshooting indicates no error's. I would avoid this product.That being said I have just purchased a new HP Photosmart Premium All-in-One Printer (CD055A#ABA), supported by user reviews for home use only and it had better meet my expectations, or it will be the last HP inkjet printer product I'll ever purchase."
positive,"Great Shoes--my son loves them: I would recommend these to anyone that has an interest in buying them. I got them for my son (16 yrs) and he did not like to color, so we sent them back for another color and now he wears them all the time. He loves them. Thanks for the fast service and a great product."
positive,"A good adaptation: The art, music, and even voices might seem odd at first, but this is a very faithful adaptaion of the novel. It captures the feel of the characters perfectly and it's cool actually hearing the goblin song (among others) put to music. If you like the novel of The Hobbit then you should give this film a view. You'd probably enjoy it"
positive,"The networking Benjamin Franklin: The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, although self-serving, made some excellent points. He was an excellent networker, and was way ahead of some current gurus on how to get ahead in the business world. However, he proved with his son that he could hold a grudge. He also neglected his wife. He had a fine sense of timing in political matters and knew the value of patience and persistence in his time in France and England."
positive,"love: this album is awesome, i love the sound and is great to meditate to or just to relax... thankful for this album."
negative,Huge Disappointment: I want to start by saying that I loved The Firm and liked several others of John Grisham's books. But this book was a huge disappointment. There was way too much time spent talking about church visits and introducing yet another new undeveloped character. The middle of the book drags and lacks direction. The best part of the book was the relationship he has with Callie's family. The nine years that Padgitt spends in jail could have and should have been condensed!
negative,"Compelling story but reads like a textbook: The premise of this story is interesting and the story is good; it's too bad it's so poorly executed. The prose is blocky and reads like a pre-history textbook with characters and plot slapped on as an afterthought. In general there is just too much time spent on detail, like the author needed to make several length-reducing rewrites. For example she spends quite a bit of time describing how the women in the Clan are treated as property, which is so cliched it doesn't need more than a passing mention. She spends a lot of time talking about side characters who are too under-developed as characters to tell apart. The detail about the pre-historical fauna and lifestyle are told in long paragraphs that bring the story to a screeching halt, rather than being woven into the narrative in a way that's still entertaining. However with a lot of skimming the book did keep me reading until the end."
negative,"Kaplan SAT Math Workbook: It's not that good. I was expecting a lot of math problems to practice with, but its not that. It is kinda of useless. Save your money. I recommend you get Kaplan SAT 12 Practice Tests book instead because there are enough practice tests and you could just do the math problems from it if thats what you need to work on."
positive,I thought that this book was good for an older audience.: This book was very interesting. The way Steinbeck portrays Lennie and George just sets the mood. Giving Lennie his tremendous size and childish brain and having George as a tiny man with big ideas makes every situation they get into a bigger challenge. Their slured speech and stupidness is a key to this thilling novella. I feel this book is however for an older audience because of the foul language and the way George treats Lennie who has a mental problem.
positive,9 year old pencil sharpener freak: when I first got my sharpener I loved it! But after a few months the side of the tip had wood on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IT WAS VERY HARD TO WRITE!!! the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is very heavy duty and because when you jam the pencil in it still works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't press hard a lot:]
positive,Bradley Special Blend Bisquettes 48 pack: These bisquettes add great smoke flavor to any meat! I have been only using it a short time but the meat taste has been great.
positive,My ebook.: This is a free ebook that I downloaded. It is about the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906.Great read about history.
negative,"It is not worth the time spent reading it.: This book is repetitious and after several episodes, boring. Tom Brokaw should stick to reading the news on NBC. If you want a good book on this subject, read,""Citizen Soldiers."" You will not regret it."
negative,"I shouldn't have...: I purchased this hoping it would eliminate the need to run to the microwave to heat up my coffee... But, it hasn't done the job for me. I've only used it a few times and each time, it made my coffee taste funky. And, trust me - it's not the coffee. I've used the same coffee and coffee maker for at least 2 years.It's obviously worked for many that purchased it - so that's great. But, it has not met my expectations.The good thing is that it was only $10. I will end up donating it in hopes someone else will be happy with it.Sorry, Mr. Coffee. I don't like giving less than stellar reviews, but had to this time..."
positive,"Excellent read: I found this to be one of the most engaging books I have read in a long time. I read it in three nights and was sad when it was over. The author appears to have done a LOT of research on this subject, amply illustrated by his extensive notes at the end of the book. It's great to read a book that is both well-researched and well-written. My only complaint, a small one, is that I wish he had spent more time discussing the racial dynamics of the crew. Unlike some authors, Philbrick definitely didn't ignore this topic. But when the African-American members of the boats die off and are eaten, one by one, I was totally incredulous. How could this have happened? I thought Philbrick could have spent more time discussing other historic shipwrecks where there were racial issues involved. Perhaps, however, there really wasn't enough data to go on. Anyway, as I said, I greatly enjoyed this book."
negative,"Disapointing for BD quality.: Although I did not purchase this from amazon, I feel this will be helpful. I was very disapointed in the quality of this recording format. I kept asking myself is this how grainy this picture is. It does not fit the new BD quality period. I have dvd's that look better then this BD copy on my same player. Before you purchase this google reveiws for this BD saphire series. There are even some threads that have rumors of Paramount offering a free limited exchange for this disc. Dont waste your money untill they re-record this in the newest highest BD standards."
positive,I never thought I l'd like historical fiction...: but I loved this book. I could not get enough of it. I was eager to turn each page and am actually a little sad that I've finished it. I will not be excited to see what other historical fiction I can get my hands on. Definitely one of my new favorites!
positive,"A Great Adventure story both of them!!: I've been a fan of Arnnold Schwarzenegger since I was a little girl and when I heard he became the Gov of California a few years ago I own the complete Terminator trilogy but I am not going to see the fourth terminator movie since it looks really not so great but otherwise these two movies: Conan the barbarian & conan the destroyer is a great adventuroues movie from start to finish on both, you will be on the edge of your seat from start to finish on both movies. They are great action/adventure flicks right to the end and I strongly recommend whoever likes action/adventure movies should get this movie!!"
positive,"beautiful!: Ai Yazawa does it again. Her gorgeous art makes this book great- for paradise kiss fans or anyone else who happens to open it. Yazawa is a creative genious and her fashion designs are beautiful, using the gothic lolita style that has become increasingly popular in the US. I suggest you read this book...if not for the awesome story, then for the even more awesome art."
negative,"Not at their best: Not much to add to the other reviews except to agree that it is by no means their best album. Not wishing to offend anyone, it seems to me that their sound is becoming more american - I suppose your environment influences you as a writer/composer and as the band have made the USA their home it was bound to happen. I just feel like that they've lost an edge that Chrome and Happy Days had, but I've still got them to listen too and as as with many of their albums I guess it'll grow on me as I didn't like Chrome to begin with - and eventually I had to replace the vinyl as I'd worn it out so there you go. Still a fan."
positive,Ox Team Days on the Oregon Trail: A good read. Interesting for those interested in history. Memorable and realistic portrayal of what that trip must have been like for the brave souls who traveled West at that time.
negative,"This is my worst nightmare-------DO NOT WATCH THIS: Oh man. Picked up this steaming pile of shart in the $5.50 bin. I watched it years ago, and didnt remeber any of it so I watched it again. That was the worst mistake of my life.This is a bastard son of a decent series. Its kinda like Seed Of Chucky in the way that the prevois seriers were movies. The actors of all the old movies realize Freddy is real becuase he lives in the script, or something lousy like that. Not to mention there are only like 3 murders and Freddy looks totally lame, especailly with that retared Robot Glove.If you like the Nightmare movies, and never seen this movie, DO NOT WATCH IT AT ALL COSTS! It humiliates the memories of all the other Nightmares and will make you despise them all."
negative,"Latin American fiction goes Harlequin: If you're looking for literature, forget it. This is barely at summer beachtime reading level. On the other hand, if you like romance novels set in ""mysterious exotic locations"" this may be just for you. Hell, take a look at the cover, it's just a ""latinized"" version of that guy with the long hair who sells butter standing on a windy cliff with a bodice-busting babe and a mansion in the background. How sad that fiction from this area of the world is now coming to this. And Borges wept. (Yeah, I know, re-reading what I wrote it sounds snobbish, but I'm still angry that I spent the money for this tripe)."
positive,The cost and ultimate futility of war: A tragic disaster (by a terrorist act) brings the world to war with everyone saying we had no choice! The interworkings of all the players shows how it could all could've been avoided by the strength of severel strong leaders
positive,"One of the Best and rightfully so: This was a great movie! Russell Crowe made Maximus totally believable and this film gives you an insight into Roman history. Except for a couple of things, it is true to the historical happenings. It brings the animalistic side of humanity to the forefront while balancing it with the spiritual side of the main character. Well written, well acted, and not a trace of sex or 4 letter words, even the battle scenes are done as tastefully as possible. I was on the edge of my seat during the battle scenes, cringing at the actions of Commodus and cheering for Maximus when he proves what it is to really be a man."
negative,"End Product Is Great, Hardware Not So Much: My wife purchased the B60 model for our home in December of '09. After 2 months of use it stopped working as it was designed - pump failure. I returned it and decided to upgrade to the B70 model. After only three days of use the B70 began having the same issues as the B60, the pump would run for about 2 minutes and the unit would shutoff.Again, I returned the brewer and replaced it with another B70 unit. For roughly two weeks our third brewer worked flawlessly. Now, we're returning it for a fourth. Same issue...pump runs for a couple of minutes and then shuts off.I rated the B70 with 2 stars. If the end product, the coffee, wasn't such high quality I would have rated the B70 a 1 star. If you're in the market for a Keurig brewer I would wait until they redesign the pump before making your purchase. Too much money to buy K-cups and never get to use them and enjoy a nice cup of Joe.Footnote: we always use filtered water in our brewers as Keurig suggests."
negative,"A Bing collection: A compilation of pieces from Esquire and Fortune over the past twenty years or so is what we have here. Kind of a mixed bag, at times very funny, others not so. I found myself wanting some of the articles to go on longer."
positive,"Outstanding piece of literature: I'm a big fan of Steinbeck to begin with. This book does a superb job of characterization. In my mind the two main characters, George and Lennie have such great personalities and they are complete opposites but for the story line they compliment each other beautifully. This is a piece of literature that really allows the reader to envision the characters and also shows the development of what it was like to live during this time period in America."
negative,"Not recommended: We have had this printer about 3 weeks and the cartridge already needs replaced. We do not do an excessive amount of printing, so I think that is a little too soon to run out of ink.Also this printer jams up very easily (one of the reasons I was replacing the last HP printer I had) I feel I have spent as much time fixing paper jams as I have printing. It is easy to fix when it does jam up, but a little frustrating that it happens so often.The print quality is good (just make sure you have the paper settings set correctly to the type of paper you are using!) and it does print quietly and is easy to operate. But overall I would not recommend it."
positive,"An extraordinary, beautifully acted and sung rendition: Filmed in Czechoslovakia, with a cast that seems perfectly suited physically to the James' novel's descriptions, Turn of the Screw has the added advantage of Britten's ""regulars"" (Peter Pears et al) providing the music to which the actors flawlessly lipsynch. The atmosphere evoked visually and musically does full service to both the intricacies and shading of the opera, and to the psychological ambiguities of the plot and characters. Truly one of the best filmed, sung, and acted opera videos in recent memory."
negative,"Ouch, this is painful to watch...: I love some of Jet Li's work (esp. in LW4), but this movie was just terrible. Way too much wire-fu, the plot was unintelligible and it seemed like the whole film was in fast forward. The only saving grace was the horrible job of translating on the subtitles. Example: when one character means to say ""I have to go the bathroom"" he instead says ""I want pissing."" Without that it wouldn't have been funny at all."
positive,"Farberware did it again: I dropped my bowl of salsa yesterday with the lid on, and nothing leaked. =D I love the pots, lids, nonstick coating, nest-able bowls and lids... I just love Farberware and this purchase has made me SO happy. =D"
positive,"Best Basie Collection Available: This killer box set covers most of Basie's best in studio work from 1936 to 1945 when he had the best band around, bar none. We are talking about some of the very best jazz musicians of all time: Lester Young, Herschel Evans, Buck Clayton, Don Byas, Sweets Edison and the monster rhythm section of Freddy Green, Walter Page and Jo Jones. Of course the Count himself was no slouch on the piano and add the vocals of Jimmy Rushing and Helen Humes and you've got 4 discs of music you can listen to over and over again without it ever growing stale. There is simply not a less than very good song in the lot. JSP once again does a fine remastering job. Even if you have the 3 disc Complete Decca set, much of which is included here, it's still well worth it to get this one too."
positive,"Book: Great book. Says that I need more words for review, so here are some more. This is ridiculous Amazon! Ok"
negative,"SKULLS - IT WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH OR BE ANGER: This movie is mean, man ...!!! It was clearly made with the best of intentions: a history about a Secret Society and a young man ( Jackson in his worst performance ever ) trying to get out of it. But the execution of the screenplay is so bad that all is lost..."
positive,"Julia and Lena put out a great album!: Julia and Lena of the group t.a.t.u. put out a great album! They have gotten tons of recognition, and have a totally new fan base. They are all over the place, litterally. The album has a nice mix of balads as well as funk and dance. I think that just about anyone can listen to this album and be completely satisfied.Not to mention the fact that there is Russian on it too. Emagine how many people out there, actually know russian? And how many of T.a.t.u's fans are out there learning the words to they're russian songs? Tons, which says something. The album is great from the first song to the last. Knowing they put so much work into such a great album is inspiring. They broke boundaries with this one....Thats for sure!!!!!"
positive,"Entirely unlistened to...: Having only seen the show live and never heard the recording of the cast, I can only advise anyone thinking of spending money on this album to consider spending a few more pennies and hearing the experience live. Sondheim is an auteur I have never spent time listening to. I had always associated him with ""what is not to like?"" New York, an entity that has pervaded a great deal of modern culture. But reducing him to those kinds of parallels is to miss the sheer beauty of the man's gift for enlightened beauty. And therein lies the greatness of Manhatten before the turn of the last century. Boy did they have it good. Shame someone had to come along and make a right mess...there is beauty here. Enjoy it."
negative,Bad customer service: I was suppose to receive my book no later than september 7th and I just received it on sept 17th. also the bag was torn the c.d. with the book is gone and there is no packageing slip. I had never had this type of experience I am very disappointed
negative,"Outdated: Probably the most common reason to purchase this book is to gain information about becoming an independent medical transcriptionist, but I really was disappointed with this book as far as that is concerned. Technology and medicine both advance and change on a daily basis which leaves this book, printed in 2002, in somewhat of a dark age, especially now that the most cost effective, time efficient, and popular way of transferring all sorts of data is electronically.While there is some good information in this book, I don't think the amount of information that is relevant is worth the price. Most of this stuff can be found on the internet more accurately than in the pages of this book."
negative,"Really, all this just to sell books: Listen, I like Tom Brokaw as a journalist, but this book was such an obvious pander in order to sell books. It worked, he sold a lot of copies. By calling the WWII generation the ""Greatest Generation"", it gives anyone born within the general area the idea that they are great. Brokaw doesn't bother to make a distinction between the ""GI Generation"", or the people who actually marched off the war, fought a war, came home, built a middle class and thrived. And those of the ""Silent Generation"" who came a long a little later and were big on conformity in the 1950's, didn't suffer in the war or the Great Depression. I don't think just because you're old, you're great, and the author simply would not make the distinction in order to sell copies."
positive,"Great bag dryer: I ordered this for a good friend of mine who hung bags all over to dry them. He is very environmentally conscience and liked to reuse as many bags as he could before having to throw them away. This item gave him a very easy way to dry them after they were rinsed. He says it's easy to store when he's done with it. He says it is sturdy, attractive and practical. His only regret is that he doesn't have more of them...It's not good for big bags"
positive,"Weak Ending, but I would recommend this book.: It was a good read. Weak ending. I've read worst. His other two books had better endings, however, up until the end it was good. The history lesson was useful. I would buy this book again. Now that I think about it I did buy this next one ""the Templar Legacy"" so what does that tell you."
positive,"AFX - Smojphace: I think AFX's take on ""Run the Place Red"" is incredibly fun -- it makes me want to jump and shimmy each time I hear it. Now, I'm not a huge fan of ragga, but ragga-jungle-drill 'n' bass? I think it's a genius combination, one that only the demented mind of Mr. James could discover. You can barely understand the vocals beneath the percussion -- they're more flavor than anything else. As for the two noise tracks, they're rather interesting the first time around (not to mention intense on the squeals), but I don't think they stand up to repeated listens. Mostly because I don't want to go deaf."
negative,"The Phoenix Almost Rises: I wrote a much longer and more detailed of this film once, but They wouldn't print it so I'll just give you the basic conclusion: Joaquin Phoenix's EYES have more life than this entire dreadful film.Absolutely the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands."
positive,"A tender, delightful romance!: I enjoyed this book so much! It made me grin and it brought tears to my eyes. I like that Theresa Medieros has both laughter and tears in her books because real life is like that too. It's what makes her stories so real and so unforgettable. I wanted to be like Lottie and I sure wanted Hayden to be my man! And the ghost made a great story even better! This story is one I will always cherish. I'll be first in line for her next wonderful love story!"
negative,"A quick read!: This is one of those books that you come across in your life that people talk about and mention to you a few times and eventually you get around to reading it. Since it's only about 123 pages long, it is definitely a quick read. The storyline goes at a good pace and there's just enough happening to keep you interested in the plot.Most people I've talked to about this book didn't care for the lack of details. That didn't bother me so much. The only reason that I am not giving this book a better review is because of my frustration with the main character. If Mersault would just CARE about something, anything, the outcome of this story would be so much different. Sure, this is the point the author is trying to get across, but still. I found Mersault's stand-offish attitude to be very frustrating.This is definitely one of those books that you want to discuss with a friend when you are finished, so be sure that if you grab this book, grab another copy for a friend as well."
positive,"Don't judge a book by its cover: I had read the book before I purchased it. I love the story. When I received the book through amazon there was significant water damage and the paint was peeling of the cover. It was said to be ""new."" Perhaps it was ruined during shipping, but my other two Penguin Hardcover Classics in the same order were perfectly intact. Whatever the case may be, I was still saving money purchasing through Amazon."
positive,"love em: Converse are great for your feet. They contain little padding, so you maintain a natural walking motion. Its basically one step above being barefoot. I actually use them to weight train. They are also very stylish. Who doesn't love converse?"
negative,This device is the worst ever: if its not tranferring the wrong music... its freezing up.. or not liecening properly.. or the device itself sticks(dail to select with). this is my third sansa and will be my last
negative,"Jumpy terrible product: This cable worked well on my PS3 for a total of about 30 minutes before the picture became jumpy and skipped. Tried games, DVD's and Blu-rays all with the same result. Completely useless."
negative,"It's informative but....: This book can be informative at times but most of the time, I felt like I was reading the book version of the home shopping channel. If you're already a transcriptionist, you don't need this book. And if you're a newbie, The Medical Transcription Career Handbook has more and better eye-openers to help you get started."
positive,"Fun Learning: Thesaurus Rex by Laya Steinberg, Illustrated by Debbie Harter is a delightful picture book for the early years of speaking. With adorable illustrations in bright, eye-catching colors, the book teaches action synonyms. The young child will delight in repeated readings and will quickly recite the simple text along with you, learning many new words that have similar meanings as he enjoys the book. The little dinosaur in all the pictures is one you and your child will enjoy following through the pages of fun and happy sounds."
negative,DATE MOVIE I THINK COULD HAVE DONE WAY BETTER!!!!!!: Date Movie with Alyson Hannigan was a ok movie i think that they could have made it funnier then what they say it was.... Julia James is a fat girl trying to find love and one day while working at her dad's family restaurant she meets the man of her dreams or what she says her prince.... She then does herself a complete makeover and falls in love with her man..... This movie was a cry for help and i think that they could have made it better!!!!!!
negative,"Buyer Beware!: Oh Please! How does Ms. Ban Breathnach live with herself ---Selling a blank book for $12.95! Keeping a journal is not her newidea, but an age old idea (an an excellent one.) Any book will do to write your journal, and it is easier to write in a composition book or ringed binder than in this stiffly bound book that won't stay open."
negative,"Sleep indusing boredom: I HATE this book! It is so boring! Basiclly, this girl is moving from some island to Conneticut in the 1600's, and the storyline basiclly follows all the random boring things she does day to day, even when there could be action, it is still boring. Only read this if you have trouble falling asleep. There is hardly any magic or anything like that at all, as said by the title."
positive,"The best of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer: This set is a wonderful collection of Terence Hill's and Bud Spencer's classics.Some are them together and others their soloe films.The collection includes Nobody's the Greatest (a.k.a. A Genius two partners and a dupe.),Little Rita of the west,Renegade,All the way boy's and much more.It is the greatest set ever,filled with slapstick."
positive,"A book that deepens your faith & transforms your family life: This is a great book for all Catholics, but it is an essential book for Catholic fathers, like me. At the center of the modern crisis in family life is a crisis of genuine fatherhood. The essence of restoring fatherhood is turning the hearts of fathers back to God the Father. The renewal of family life will proceed from the renewal of our life with the Father. Read this important slowly and prayerfully. It will deepen your faith and transform your family life"
positive,"Good, but it gets better: Motorhead put their blueprint together for this album, and it is very good (especially ""Pay Your Price"" and ""I'll be Your Sister"") but they still needed to hone in on the speed and aggression."
positive,"Nice Collection of Christmas Classics: I bought this for my sister for Christmas. She really likes the old Christmas movies that are included in this case. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were four, clearly labeled dvds in the case. Each disk displays which episodes/shows are contained on them. It is very convenient, in case you get them mixed up."
positive,"excellent coffee, but expensive: Excellent coffee, but on the expensive side. I like medium blends. If you like medium coffee, this could be the coffee for you!"
positive,"A really fun movie....definately rewatchable: Not that Reeves is a great actor...never was, probably never will be...but he does get parts in movies that I dont mind owning...if i'm gonna buy a dvd its gonna be something that I dont watch once every year or so.But what I really cant believe is that no catholic groups have been screaming bloody murder about the inverted cross shaped shotgun on the cover...I dont remember if the movie poster had the same thing."
negative,"Not mind blowing at all: Maybe I expected too much from this book. I thought this book could give me more insight into the dangers of statistical interpretations or the wrongful use of statistics. This book didn't help me at all with that. It's all very (very) basic stuff people should watch out for, when using statistics. Most of this I already knew. I think for anybody who has already red a book from Nicholas Taleb (or anything alike) this book will not present any new material.To people completely new to statistics, this book might be helpfull, but to those who frequently use statistics for their jobs or in their free time, this book won't add any value. There are much better books on statistics out there."
negative,"ejects micro SD chip!: I was very happy with my Sansa View, until all of a sudden my micro SD chip was missing. I couldn't imagine someone stealing just a chip, but then when I tried to put a new one in, I noticed it would only be installed for a second or two before the spring inside the unit would expel the chip. It would actually launch it up 4-6 inches! So now I know my original chip is somewhere at the gym, certainly vacuumed up by now.It's a great player, but check to make sure your SD card doesn't come out too easily or just send it back!"
positive,Great Movie...Especially in HD DVD: Too bad HD-DVD didn't win the battle.This movie is incredible as far as effects and action.The HD is wonderful and is a great way to show off your setup.A must for HD-DVD fans
negative,"Pompous author, terrible book: I have read many books on the subject and this is by far the worst one. The author thinks he knows everything and that his book is the definitive work on the subject. That is a bad combo. When you have that attitude, then you are no longer open to new methods or opinions. Any book, in this day and age, that has 4 chapters on soil and only one on hydro is better used as kindling. Setups are poorly explained, there are few pictures, and it yields more frustration than crops."
negative,"Lot's of potential, but not ready for prime time yet: I just bought this device, and it's definately got a lot going for it in the ""wow, cool!"" factor. Unfortunately . . . it really isn't ready for public release yet. D-link insists that most of the known issues will be worked out with software fixes . . . but the units on shelves now are just a buggy mess.Most of the problems have already been described in other reviews, but I'm unable to get a solid wireless signal to the device and have no desire to run a hard-wired line to my living room at the moment. I've tried a new router, replacement antenna, and moving the equipment around as much as conceivably possible . . . to no effect. Video and Audio still skip too much.Also, for what video I could actually get to play, much of it is in widescreen and the device has no options for adjusting aspect ratio, so the picture's just stretched vertically over the whole screen. A letterboxing option on the remote would be a nice addition."
negative,I wish I could get a refund!: This book has to be the worst book I have ever purchased! I was so disappointed in it! I found nothing in it that was new and it seemed like the people who wrote it never graduated from elementary school! They are ex-cons who have a vendetta against David Berkowitz. I really can't recommend it to anyone. Save your money!
negative,"awful..... and hold the sauce: what aan awful read. fortunately i saw the movie before i read the book. Had i read the book first, i would have skipped the flick. julie powell is a whiner, probably a semi lush, and the kind of good friend you wouldn't want. Her worst offense, however, is that she is totally boring and that is the best description of the book. didn't read it past half way... I had kindled it it or else i would have tried for a refund."
positive,usb male to male cable: Very happy with recent usb cable I purchased at a very good price through Amazon. This replaced another cable I was using and works much better and faster.
negative,"Tiny Tim in Adulthood: Mr. Timothy: A Novel was disappointing in its lack of cleverness.I always look for tidbits of humor but found nothing much in this ""angry"" immage of Tim as an adult."
negative,"This book stunk!: Well, basically what happens without all the boring details is there is this guy named Montag and he is a fire fighter. The only thing is, the job of the fire fighter is to start the fires rather than putting them out. Well one day when he has to burn this old womens house it really hits him hard because she refuses to get out of her house before they light it on fire. So the firemen end up burning her house, the books that were in it, and the old lady. That made him think that there must have been something in those books worth dying for. Then he met this girl name Clarisse who made him start thinking even more. So he sort of came to the conclusion that he really did not enjoy doing what he did for a living."
negative,Terrible product save your money!: These do not work at all. I have waxed hot and cold wax for years for my own touch ups inbetween salon waxings. This does nothing but pull off some debris if your skin is not spotless. Besides that the price is crazy high considering you will use 4 each time for both upper/ lower on both brows.
negative,"Cheap metal: It all depends on your purpose for these safety pins. I needed them for holding Velcro in place as the Velcro was pulling apart too easily. These safety pins bent as I tried to stab them into the material. The point is sharp, but the surface is rough. This rough point causes the material to cling to the safety pin rather than allow the pin to pass through easily.I would recommend the Dritz Quilter's Safety Pins. They are Nickel plated which makes them smooth and rust resistant."
positive,"Brought back childhood memories!: I grew up watching this movie with childhood friends from church. When I got the dvd in the mail, I emailed all my friends and told them that we need to get together for a Robin Hood reunion. (Note that this review was written in 2007 and all of my friends and I are now age 24-30.) Anyway, it was surprising how all of us sang along to songs we hadn't heard on over 15-20 years. Great movie! It brought back a lot of good childhood memories."
negative,"yAwn* *: This movie stars Mrs. Potts from Beauty and the Beast. Only she isn't a tea pot in this movie. She's some old woman that had a heart attack. Now we're all waiting for her to die. 98 long minutes. She doesn't die. My grandma says she was dead at the end, but I say no..that was me. I was bored to death.The general plot is Mrs. Potts has 3 non-teapot kids and I can't tell them apart. It seems that Nancy and her brother are married. But they aren't. Nancy is really married to some of grouch. He should die too. But I don't think he does.The best way to veiw this movie is with the tv off and you in another room with your friends eating chocolate."
positive,"These gals got game!: ""You Don't Know Nothin' About Love"" alone makes this album worth picking up, but there's plenty more in this collaboration. Irma Thomas can still bring it, and Tracy Nelson could knock down a wall with her great pipes. Marcia Ball lends her sly, laid back vocals to the mix."
negative,"Put holes in our pool liner: We loved this toy at first . . .great fun! But when my son decided to put his foot in it and bounce around the pool, he put 7 holes in our pool liner before we discovered the problem. Never thought that would happen and this fun toy promptly went in the trash!"
positive,"Belva Plain has done it again - another great story!: Once again, Belva Plain has written a compelling family storythat was hard to put down. I have read all of her novels and enjoyed""After the Fire"" immensely. The characters are interesting and believable; and the story combines both tragedy and happiness. A must read for her fans. You won't be disappointed."
positive,"A good book to begin reading Tom Clancy: This was the very first Tom Clancy book I read. I found it very easy to read, and quite enjoyable. Ever since I read this, I have read nearly all of Clancy's novels. This, in my opinion, is right up there with ""The Hunt for Red October"" (5 stars) and ""The Cardinal of the Kremlin"" (5 stars). I highly recommend it."
negative,"Not what I was expecting.: This book is set up as a dictionary. If you enjoy reading dictionaries, then please purchase this book. The humor was lost on me because of the format."
negative,paper feed problems: I had the printer for one month before the paper feed problems occurred. I went to tech support and after they asked me re-register for the THIRD time I threw the printer out the window (literally). No HP for me!
positive,"A Symphony of Smiles: I purchased this cd on the recommendation of a friend, and intended to pass it along to another friend who runs a daycare. After listening to it, with my 15 year old son, I can't part with it! We both loved it. The music is upbeat,rhythmic, and unique, the lyrics are timely, intelligent, and witty, while teaching important values. You can't listen without moving to it. I would recommend it to any age group."
positive,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!!: I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented Dreamgirls (using my awesome Tivo/Amazon Unboxed!). I was a fan of Jennifer Hudson from my intermittant viewing of American Idol. She blew me away! I feel that she stole the show! I thought she was just an extra back up singer or something, I didn't realize that she was a main player. Many times during the movie, I was brought to tears with her powerful voice and great acting! Bravo, Jennifer! Not to be forgotten, was the other big talent that did not disappoint. I felt that the movie did a great job to keep your attention with the icing on top of the cake being all the wonderful talent involved with the project. This was Jennifer's ""introduction"" movie, and man did she make an impression! I will remember this movies as a favorite!"
negative,"Ehhh , nice visuals?: I read the book prior to wathching the film. I can only say that I was extremely dissapointed in this film.Not only did the movie insult Shirley Jackson's classic book, but also made fools of the great actors in the movie. By me saying that the movie made fools of the actors, I mean look at them , Liam neeson, Lili Taylor and Cathrine Zeta Jones , theyre all very talented but all you can do is laugh at them in this movie because the script is terrible and also very over exagerated.Donnot be fooled by this movies name. The occurances of ""hauntings"" in this movie look like they came out of a disney movie.Now the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has great visual effects, and does make you say wow when you see the house itself.So think of this movie as disneys rendition of Shirly Jacksons book. And if youd like to see what her book is really about rent the original 1963 classic with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom."
positive,"Permatex Anti-Seize seems to work well: Replaced the spark plugs and my 2001 Silverado 4.8L at about 98,500 miles and added this to the plugs in case i need to change them again at another 100,000 miles. I have not had to take them out yet so I am unsure if works, but it's only grease so it should be fine."
negative,did not work: The card did not work. Customer service did not respond. The attenna did help boost the linksys card I ended up installing.
positive,"5 stars? More like a million.: There is no way you can not enjoy this movie. ""Gladiator"" is the greatest movie I have ever seen. Russel Crowe makes the perfect Maximus...he's incredibly sexy and talented. Making the leading man complete. He'll give the others a run at the academy awards, lemme tell ya what. There is no part in the movie that anyone would consider ""slow"" or ""boring"", in the movie you have something for everyone...violence, drama, romance...its all there. The fighting scenes are edge-of-your-seat-pee-your-pants exciting. You have your gore and your glory; your villains and your heroes. See this movie, and I *assure* you that it will soon be in your video collection."
negative,"Won't hold a charge, ""infinite hold"" service.: Won't hold a charge, out of warranty and I was put on infinite hold when I called in. Will never buy a Duracell/xantrex/Schneider product again - this is an incredibly expensive boat anchor now."
positive,"Fine product: I received my Hi-Tec Altitude boots and am very pleased. I had purchased a Hi-Tec product from a retailer some time ago and was pleased with the fit, in particular. The Altitudes are solidly made, fit very well, are comfortable and as waterproof as described. I have shopped extensively for waterproof boots for trekking through the rain, snow and slush of New York City. I walk 20-30 blocks a day in these and they perform very well. I have been unable to find a similar pair of boots at this price anywhere I have shopped. I recommend these highly."
negative,"Disgusting garlic breath: First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack? The onion and other vegetables are more than enough to provide flavour."
positive,"They're blocks - keep that in mind: We got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP Catalog.There are little to no pizazz to the blocks. Some have features where you can ""spin"" them (like the letter Q - Queen) or the W (watermelon seeds that rattle) - but most are just a ""look at me"" type of a block.With that in mind - yes I like the product. They're blocks. They're meant for stacking, knocking over and banging - which my son loves (he's had these since he was 6 months). They're better than the plain wooden blocks because they're textured, they have objects inside, letters - lots of opportunities to learn letters, colors, objects, descriptions, etc.For now he's stacking, banging and knocking over. It'll be around for a while until he's ready to learn more words, colors, objects, animals. This review isn't profound or eye openings because again - they're just blocks. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist =)"
negative,Ignorance prevails: I've attempted to get Amazon to change this as well as to contact the publisher. Thomas Jefferson had NOTHING to do with the writing of the Constitution of the United States. It was written by the Continental Congress primarily by James Madison and James Monroe while Jefferson was in France. Jefferson penned the Declaration of Independence...not the Constitution! I wouldn't care but for the continuing ignorance of the origins of our country being consistently on display here and elsewhere! Dear publisher...fix this!!!
negative,"Americanized version of a Swiss story: I was pretty disappointed when I saw this movie. I have read the book, seen quite a few Heidi movies, but this one is not close to the book. The first part is ok, but the second part is totally made up.Chasings, prison, Fr. Rottenmeier is very evil and ( spoiler)tries to sell Heidi, etc.If you look for a Heidi movie that portaits the book, don't get this one. If you want a movie about Shirley Temple, this one is fine then. Being from Germany, this one dissapointed me. My favorite Heidi movie is the 1956 w/ Elsbeth Sigmund. It has a few changes from the book, but in generell is close to it and also gives you a feel of the time and place where Heidi would have lived."
negative,"Not very fun!: This toy was a gift from my daughter's aunt. We bought her duaghter the same toy! I thought she would like it...and she did for about five minutes! All it does is light up and play a song. My daughter plays with the balls more than the actual toy. Not a very good idea. What is the point of this toy? Also, it is extremely heavy, which makes it kind of dangerous!!"
negative,"Huh?: Let me get this striaght. If a woman is acting like a total bitch toward me, that means she LIKES me? My mind is officially blown.I'll bet women who take this book seriously are perfect for guys who take ""The Game"" by Neil Strauss seriously. I just hope I'm not the only single person left in this world who just wants to have a nice relationship with a nice person and not have play a bunch of silly mind games."
positive,"Nice phrasebook, but not incredibly accurate: I liked this phrasebook because it was well organized and easy to use. My only complaint is that the phrases are not always accurate. When testing my French phrases on my French-speaking colleagues, they found my pronunciation to be very good (from the phonetic pronunciation guide) but my word choice odd."
positive,"Great!: We got this for our two toddlers and it was an instant hit. Very easy to compress back into a disk for easy storage. The quality is excellent. All of the kids' friends love it, and even our niece and nephew (who are elementary school age) play with it."
positive,"Heartfelt look at WWII and the people it left behind...: I was touched reading this true account into the lives os soldiers and families suffering their personal anguish throughout the war. The letters and real emotions came to life and I was in awe. I am a Generation X twenty-something and it's a shame my generation doesn't realize what sacrifices this generation, truly the Greatest Generation has made on behalf of our freedom.The stories they shared and the worry the wives felt were awesome. You cannot appreciate what these men and women have been through, the war, the depression and all the after effects of coming home. To live in this troubled time was truly an accomplishment. This is well worth the money. Make sure you keep a box of kleenex nearby, you'll need it...Tracy Talley~@"
negative,"New title for the book: Boredom on Denali: I found the author to be overly dramatic and dreadfully overused tired cliches and crude, offensive language. She was absoulutely obsessed with outdoor urination and defication. The only redeeming quality to the book is it's meticulous description of the boredom of being trapped during a storm for days on end in a small frozen tent. She talks about being offended by people being interested in the deaths and gore, yet she endlessly talks about body bags, the removal of the dead Koreans, etc. If you want to know climbing from every conceivable angle, it's worth a read, but don't expect too much."
positive,"Not too Shabby: Pamper diapers are pretty good. They do not hold up as well as huggies as far as leaking goes, but for the price on Amazon its worth it!!"
positive,A very usefull book for pooka players: I find the book very usefull if you play a pooka. It gives special rules in ore depth and their own flaws and merits. I would highly reccoend getting it if you play or intend on playing a pooka.
positive,Works great: This was purchased for my mother-in-law and she loves it. Keeps her tea and hot coco warm for her as she sits in her recliner and reads or watches TV.
positive,"vegas season 1: Love the show, hope that it makes it for a second season. Love all the characters and think that they all do a great job with their characters CBS keep this show on the air"
negative,Not as expected: Don't be fooled by the title this book has nothing to do with the Stock Market. It is about how to add merchandise to a store. If your intersted in the stock market stay away from this one.
positive,"Great Tweezer: Very easy to use, great tweezer for a great price! Is only a bit smaller than a standard sized tweezer but it works EXACTLY the same. what's even better is it helps anyone who is going 'green'"
negative,"dining chairs: I was so excited when I received my new chairs. The were easy to put together and look beautiful. The durability of the chairs is questionable. You can not put much weight on the backs of the chairs while sitting. Both of my chairs broke. It is almost like the pegs used in the assembly are cheap. They actually break into a dusty mess. Which is kind of ironic, because the tag said that they are ""fine furniture"". If I knew that the chairs were so cheap, I would have not purchased them."
positive,"buyer of boot: This is my second pair of this Hi Tec boot. The first pair lasted a very long time and was very comfortable the whole time. They break in right away. For years I was a die hard Danner buyer and I can say these beat my last pair of over priced Danner hikers hands down. (really they were more sneaker than hiker -I still love my Danner steel toes for a work boot) But my favorite thing about these Hi Tec boots are the eyes and hooks -THEY ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER OWNED. The laces last forever because the eyes and hooks are so smooth and rounded. Like I said, just bought my second pair -five star goodness."
negative,"Do yourself a favor. Do not buy this terrible CD.: What are you people taling about? This CD is terrible! All of the songs have no spirit. They stink. Godsmack and Machine Head disgraced Sweet Leaf and Hole In The Sky. I cannot believe Black sabbath gave these bands the permission to use those songs. Then there are the rap versions of Sabra Cadabra and Iron Man which are absolutely terrible. By buying this Cd I have lost all respect for Slayer. I have all of their CDs, but after hearing their version of the classic ""Hand Of Doom"" I wanted to bury my head in the sand. Megadeth's version of ""Never Say Die"" was just as bad. Shame on them both. The only listenable tracks on the CD are... 1. Pantera: Electric Funeral (the only good track) 2. Primus (with Ozzy) N.I.B.Don't get this CD!"
negative,"The Hobbit- An Enchanting Beginning to an Epic Series: The Hobbit is the introductory novel to the epic fantasy, The Lord of the Rings. This book is about an imaginary creature called a hobbit, who goes on a journey through the imaginary country of Middle Earth with a group of dwarves. Bilbo, the hobbit, and his company of dwarves are on their way to steal back their long forgotten treasure that is guarded by a hideous dragon. This story tells of the hardships they encounter on their journey and the changes that each character, especially Bilbo, goes through. this book is wonderful because it ties in the world of fantasy with real life. The characters go through the same emotional and sometimes physical struggles that we find ourselves going through. The Hobbit is a great book that everybody can relate to in one way or another. If you are looking for an exciting and thrilling escape from reality, reading The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best way to do just that."
positive,REVIEW - Borror & DeLong: This is a keystone book that should be in every entomologist's library next to Chapman's The Insect: Structure & Function and Romorser & Stoffolano's The Science of Entomology.
positive,"Hardest hitting air hammer i've ever seen.: I worked in a tire shop for 20 years doing a lot of front end work. I've used a lot of air hammers, you name it I tried it, Snap-On, Mac, Mac-co, Cornwell, even Craftsman. All were mere child's toys compared to this CP. It has a long stroke, so the hits per minute aren't that high, But it hits hard. It's like a Diesel engine, low end torgue. I know it cost 2 to 3 times what a ""normal"" air hammer cost. But it will take a ball joint out 2-3 times faster. Oh, If you ever do King pins. OMG, I really don't know how you'd do them without it. Trust me. You will ask yourself, How did i ever get along without this.Jason"
positive,the truth: this book shows the truth of the world...that it is absolutely absurd. we must all acknowledge it first to start to make any real sense of it all. camus is a genius along with sartre.
negative,"confused from page 1: did anyone notice the masculine pronoun ""he"" referring to Sam on the first few pages??? then, when the call from the nursing home came, sam was no longer a ""he"" but a she! i must've re-read the first 5 pages at least 10x, wondering if i was seeing things!!! editting mistakes like that, right out of the gate, are totally bogus. i never bothered reading further!"
negative,"only came with one disc: i ordered the two disc-special edition of this movie and it only came with one of the discs. i would have been okay with that if the one disc happened to be the disc that had the movie on it. unfortunately, the one disc i did receive was the directors commentary and such. waste of time and money."
negative,"Dd Not Waste Your Time or Money!!!!: I was truely looking forward to reading this book. What a disapointment! This author is a self indulgent, whinny, twit. Her discrption of the 9/11 victim's families is enough to make you hate her.I want my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,Great: My daughter had to read this book for school and she said it was a great read. She is 14 and it was easy for her to understand and follow.
positive,"Heavy and technical Metalcore: Yes the more emoish metalcore is becoming so ""trendy"" but that's cool, just as long as they're good, but for AMAZING metalcore, Red Chord is where it is at. This nine-song masterpiece ends in just under half hour and delivers some of the most intelligent compositions heavy music has heard. Sometimes so backwards that you can't even tell what's going and other times so bone-crushing that you have to step away from the speakers for fear of your life, but no matter what the riffs work together perfectly through each song. The guitarist is incredible. The drumming is superb as well, with lots of quick time changes and riffs that are played once, the man on the throne keeps it together and flowing. All in all this is great for fans of truly talented music and should be in your CD collection. BUY IT!"
negative,"big disappointment: I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can't believe all the ""5 star"" reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection. The characters are meaningless, the text is scattered and awkward. Perhaps something was lost in translation, who knows. I've never been one to give up on a book but I considered it many times with this one."
negative,"Silk huh ?: if your looking for a silk plant look elsewhere , nothing but cheep plastic . I put this in my tank and it will not even stand upright , just lays on the bottom as the stem will not support this POS"
negative,Might not be worth it..: After about a week of wearing it one of the stones fell out. Other then that it was very pretty. But i cant wear it anymore.
positive,The best music experience I ever purchased.: This thing works flawlessly. SD cards are dirt cheap and play faster than CD's. The MP3 CD function play better than any I have used and the USB plays thumbdrives but at a slower loading pace.
negative,"Very disappointing: When Oasis is good, they have catchy lyrics and well thought out arrangements.But when they're bad,they sound annoyingly loud and rushed.This cd shares a bit of each.With good tracks like D'You Know What I Mean,All Around the World, and Don't Go Away, you wonder how they made the crappy My Big Mouth,I Hope I Think I Know,etc.If you liked Whats the Story (Morning Glory)chances are you will not like this album."
positive,"The Great Mr. Handel: This was the first movie I ever saw. In 1943, my High School in Chichester, Sussex, England used this movie for the only field trip made during my time there. It must have been considered as an excellent educational film. I ordered it now for nostalgic reasons, and because it started a love affair with classical music."
positive,"Paxton Quigley is a realist: When women ask me about safety and firearms, this is the first book I recommend to help them on their terms."
negative,The Abyss That Missed: The movie took way too long to get to anything half-way exciting. It could have been cut down to 30 minutes!
negative,"Annoying: This kind of ""music"" is just annoying to my ears. Please, go listen to some Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, Sepultura or Slayer... NU METAL [stinks]"
negative,"Do NOT buy this hardcover!: This hardcover edition of The Daughter of Time is expensive and cheaply done. There are many appalling typos, the most absurd being "" Henry VIP"" for Henry VII. It possibly constitutes a copyright violation, with no publisher or publishing date information. The front cover picture is of Edward III, not Richard III. An insult to Josephine Tey's brilliant and well-written book. Read her book, just don't buy this edition!"
positive,Koga Melodies/Ryoichi Hatori Melodies: This cd proves anything Percy Faith touched he could make beautiful.These 2 albums were never released here in the US but in Japan.Koga was temporarely released in the UK.Every song on this album is lush and beautiful with no vocals just the strings that made Faith famous.Any Faith fan as well as people that like b/ez music should pick this up.It is accompined by extensive liner notes in the booklet by Alan Bunting and the original album art is also shown.Koga Melodies tracks 1-12 recorded in 1970.Ryoichi Hatori Melodies tracks 13-24 were recorded in 1972.
positive,The Lord of the Flies: I thought this book was good and it was exciting. I like the way the author describes the characters in the story. I also like how you read the book you can picture everything. I like how the boys start their own government and they have a leader. His name is Ralph. They all just want to have fun but the littleuns don't listen to the older ones like Ralph and Jack. Then every one starts turning on every one. Ralph and Jack are arguing and the littleuns just swim and play never help with anything. Jack is starting paint his face with different colors while he hunts. Then he kills a pig. Ralph wants Jack to make shelters and Jack wants hunt so they start fighting and Jack takes a group of kids and he has a tribe. Jack and his tribe kill some of Ralph's tribe. It's a very good book you will have to see what happens to Ralph.
negative,"Bottom of the Barrel Actioner: Summary: Two L.A. cops (Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee) vs the Yakuza (led by Carey-Hiroyuki Tagawa, the murderer of Lundgren's parents).Dumbo martial-arts action movie is short and fast moving enough to end before we are bored. This movie is so forgettable that I forgot about it while I was still watching it. From the director of 'Class of 1984' and 'Commando'."
negative,"Needs Something Moore: I am a fan of Mandy Moore and was excited to purchase her Coverage album. I love cover songs and adored the first single Have A Little Faith In Me so I went ahead and bought the album. It is so disappointing! I find myself bored by Mandy's vocals and cannot sit through the whole album. She chose some amazing songs but did not do many of them justice. They lack their original charm and energy. While I do understand that cover songs are often not as good as the original, Coverage is a wispy, dull attempt at reviving an era of energetic and exciting songwriting. I admire Mandy for doing an album so different than her peers, but I just wish she had put a little more energy and charisma into the album. The songs have powerful messages lost on less than powerful expression."
positive,"Graceful story about a strong priest, small plot holes.: The writing, even in translation is graceful. The central character is a priest, a strong ""good soldier"" who serves the Vatican as a combination hatchet man/private detective. The mystery is initially intriguing -- who is sending the Pope e-mails that are mysterious and of deadly import?This is an enjoyable book to read... but the central character, the priest, is so strongly written that when he falls for the woman, and fails in his mission, this is mildly unbelievable. His crisis of faith and strength is a bit too precipitous. And the solution to the mystery is not adequately foreshadowed, which makes a decent solution appear arbitrary. But this is in general a very good read by an author who is erudite, writes well, and captures some of the enchantment of Seville. Makes me want to order tapas and watch the slow Guadalquivir!"
positive,"Most enjoyable!: I gave this film to my Mom for Christmas, but the whole family enjoyed it.Of course we have seen it before. Danny Kaye is very talented. The music is good, and it is very funny. Thank you."
negative,"An OK CD by Pearl Jam: Being a huge Pearl Jam fan I had to buy this new CD Binaural, I figured anything by PJ would be great. I bought the CD and listened to it and I hate to say that I was disapointed. Over the years that Pearl Jam has been around there music has gotten softer and softer, most of the songs on this CD are pratically light listening. I wish PJ could get back to there roots and play the kind of music that they are great at. If you liked old Pearl Jam music a lot and are into that kind of music, chances are you won't like this CD much."
positive,"It worked for me..: Thought this was not going to fit because I am a 44"" currently and I only ordered XL.. Like it very much"
positive,"if you can only afford one wicca book, get this one: I have bought tons of magick/wicca books in the last three years, but this one is still the best one i ever bought. Taught me most about wide range of subjects directly and indirectly used by various wicca/pagan/witchcraft groups, like moon phases, chakras, colors and various others magickal correcpondences. I like Silver's writing style too. She makes magick close and acceptable and not as macabre as some might want us to believe. Excellent book, thumbs up from me."
negative,"Wizard Alone: The one good thing I can say about this book was that it got me interested in autism for about a week. If you're going to read a book about magic, try something by Tamora Peirce."
negative,"Worse than 'New Coke': I had always assumed that the [person] who suggested producing' New Coke' had enough sense to go into retirement but unfortunatelly I was mistaken. This new product [stinks]!!! The lights are barely visible, and can not be controlled in any way similar to the previous Fisher Price Peaceful Planet . If you have no experience with the previous version you may like that this has nice sounds, but the visuals, which are what ALL the children loved, have been removed. This is a sad day for all parents."
negative,"too hard to follow: the way the characters in this book speak makes it too dificult to follow along. i tried to follow along, but too boaring. also the book is mainly based on her thoughts. there is not a lot of human interaction with the main character."
positive,clipper head: This clipper head is great for roaching a saddle mules main makes nice even cuts and stays sharp. Of all the heads I have tried this is the best and works well with the oster cordless clippers.
positive,Princeton Review study guide mirrors actual test: I found that the Princeton Review guide along with the ETS PowerPrep and the Official Guide to the GMAT to be very representative of the actual test. I took one of the Princeton Review CAD test the morning of my actual GMAT test and made the exact same score on both. I also used Kaplan but found my test results much lower than what I actually scored.
positive,"An excellent book: I was really impressed with this book. I think it will appeal to a broad range of people; those with general curiosity about war, and those ""history buffs"" who want to delve even deeper into fascinating documents they probably have never seen before. Not only are the illustrations interesting and unique, but they are beautifully presented. As a middle school teacher, I would encourage students to use Dr. Coopersmith's book as a resource mostly because it is timely, complete and compelling. Moreover, his coverage of both the Union and of Confederacy is thorough and accurate. An excellent book, indeed."
negative,"So bad it's bad: You want to like the movie because it's so awful, but it just ain't possible. The soundtrack song ""King Frat"" was edited for content before being mixed in to the film so you can clearly hear where the f-bombs would go. Feel free to shout them out yourself, I guess.If you pick this video out at the video store, your friends will never let you pick movies again."
positive,Good Book: I like it so far. Should have fine shed the book before I saw the movie. The movie has a very young Liz Taylor. I do recommend the book by L.M.A.
positive,Anolon cookware: My wife loves her new pots for cooking. I do the clean up and it is much better than our previous T-Fal set.
positive,Great for arthritic hands: I bought these holders for my dad because he has arthritis in his hands & it's difficult for him to hold 15-21 cards at a time. We used them over the holiday and they were a great hit.
positive,"Improve your kid's reading abilities: Kylene Beers has done an excellent job of collecting and introducing a number of strategies and other practical tips to help teachers, parents and anyone else interested in improving kids' abilities to read. Although this book was used as the textbook for one of my college courses, it does not read like a typical textbook at all. I would recommend this book to anyone in or outside the classroom."
positive,"Great workout for busy people: I love this video. I have used it after the birth of each of my three children and I see results everytime. I gained a lot of weight with each pregnancy (50+ lbs) and this workout alone helped me get it all off plus some. It is a nice easy to follow workout that will make you sweat. I like that you have a choice of high or low impact, so you can ease yourself back into working out if you have been out of it for a while or if you're just beginning. The toning exercises are great and you definitely feel it afterward. These are two great 30 minute routines that you can fit into a busy day. I put my baby in the swing and the older kids watch or join me. I would definitely recommend this to mothers who don't have time to get to the gym, but not to those who are more advanced and are expecting a hardcore workout."
positive,"It's really fun!: We are not from USA, in fact, we don't speak english as a birth language. So my son, that it's learning english, can play with this toy while learning new vocabulary and improve his grammar. He really likes it. He says ""Buy it!"" to all of you."
positive,"as expected: The unit is plug and play. Once I had put in the codes to get past the security in my wireless network, it worked just as advertised. The transfer rate for video to my PC is a little slower than I had hoped for, almost real time for transfer, 50 min for 60 min show.The access to the photos and music on my PC is great and faster for the photos than I expected compared to the video download speed. Have to pay extra to be able to upload video from PC to TIVO. All in all worth what I paid for it. Great to have the TIVO schedule updates off the phone line."
negative,EMachines Owners stay away!: This card is completely incompatible with Emachines' Tri-Gem Motherboards. I uninstalled all of my previous video drivers because that is what ATI told me to do when I unsuccessfully installed their card. Their automated Tech Support is useless and their phone support costs [$$$] a minute! I finally talked to Emachines' tech support and they told me that it would never work with my PC. I told them it was a good thing Circuit City has a No-Hassle 14 day return policy. I give this card 1 star because I can't give it any less than that.
negative,"There are better resources available: Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."
negative,"Obfuscation incarnate!: I had to read this (years ago) because I took English as a minor when I was an undergraduate. I cringe at the memory and the heated discussion I had with the professor (a Joyce fanatic). Now as a librarian I decided to give it another attmept, trying to keep an open mind. I have to give Joyce points for being clever and kudos for verbosity. After struggling through it again, I had to ask myself what was the point? Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun.To me as a reader, literature requires something more than an exercise in erudition or diction. I may be in a distinct minority here, but I still dislike Joyce for inflicting such a circus upon readers."
negative,I don't think it's an original product: I had a small amount of cologne left in a bottle of Emporio Armani which I purchased at Macy's a while back. I compared the smell of the Macy's bottle and the one I received from Amazon. The bottle from Amazon is not nearly as strong as the bottle purchased at Macy's. I'm wondering if I received a counterfeited bottle. Won't be purchasing this bottle again from Amazon.
negative,"Poor sound quality: Very disappointed with the sound. Eagle vision usually has very good recording quality. This sounded like there was one mike in a tin can at the back of the theater. Worst blue ray that I have ever heard. Will be putting up for sale,burning it, the apple iTunes version of machine head album sounds way better than this. Do not wate your $$$$."
positive,"A great Book about my area: MY father saw this UFO years ago and said it was real, now I can read about it. The book is like an adventure story and I would reccomend it to anyone"
negative,"Great for C Gurus...: The back cover mentions it is a book for people with ""programming backgrounds"". I thought that meant any programming language, and I figured expertise in Turbo Pascal would count, but what it should say is ""C/C++ expertise"". If you know diddly about OOP, it doesn't help very much. It as easy to read statements like ""you invoke the method call implicitly by instantiating the object with a reference."" Mr. Van der Linden is evidently a great programmer, but not a very good teacher. If you know zilch about OOP, C, or C++, pass this one up."
negative,"I can't believe someone charges money for this: This is the silliest parenting book I've ever seen. It's two or three sentences on a page and while that is, in fact, simple, it's not groundbreaking. It's not even particularly helpful. Yes, I know I shouldn't yell and that it should only be reserved for instances of great danger for my child, how does that help me when my three year old refuses to listen? Come on, don't make me feel like a failure just because I can't refrain from arguing with another human being. Most of this stuff is common sense and what isn't is probably not realistic for 95% of parents. Sorry, I just didn't love this book"
negative,"Why Did They Choose HER?!: I saw this movie on television. I was really excited because I thought it would be interesting and Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite actresses. Well...This movie was AWFUL!! Why on earth would they pick Jennifer Hewitt to play Audrey Hepburn. Natile Portman might have been a better choice. As others said, the girl who played the younger Audrey did a pretty good job. Perhaps Miss Hewitt is a better actress in other shows and movies, but not this time. This movie could almost be classified as a comedy! She didn't even keep up her fake Audrey voice throughout the entire movie,and when she did use it she sounded like Audrey with one word 'CAT'.The actors who played Gregory Peck and William Holden were a joke; they were awful and didn't look or sound like either Peck or Holden. The movie showed none of Audrey's later life. If you missed seeing this on television,you didn't miss much. If you still want to see this, rent it; you might be sorry if you buy it first."
positive,"This Is Required Listening...: If you ever wondered about the influence behind some of todays top R&B or Jazz vocalists, wonder no more. Your search should end right here. Long Live The Queen!Don't just listen to the music, vibe with the lyrics and how she creates a vivid picture with her vocal stylings. She is simply wonderful. Her voice is like a mix of Chambord, Courvoisier, and a warm fire on a cold night. My personal favorite is,""Words Can't Describe."" If you ever want to woo your guy or girl, learn the words, (especially to ""Lover Man"", ""You Hit The Spot"", ""Prelude To A Kiss"" and ""All Of Me."") slip in the CD and sing to him or her. No, you may not scat like Sarah, but you will leave an impression and he or she will definately get the message.ONE WOMAN'S ADVICE: Before you depart from this earth, BUY SWINGIN' EASY..your ears will love you for it.***Let's Stop Accepting Mediocrity As An Art Form, Buy This CD And Let Your Voice Be Heard."
positive,"DAWN'S REVIEW OF HELTER SKELTER: Helter Skelter is a very interesting book. Almost every page keeps you on the seat of your chair. It doesn't have a slow moment in it. It has details after details in which you really enjoy. The feeling of it being all real and true kept me reading this book Just think a person like that is still out there, waiting to be released. If that doesn't scare you then I don't know what will. The reality of this book is so increadible that you think it is all made up,but it is all so true. It is certainly a page turner, but I have to warn you, it will scare the hell out of you!"
negative,"Hp Customer Care! A Joke!: On 04/03/02 I bought a new printer hp photosmart 1215, it installed perfectly, now, suddenly it decided to stop dead!I have contacted Hp Customer Care re the problem....timeout settings...no help availadle...also my PC tells me there are now no drivers for this device installed! How can this be???"
positive,"Special Edition extras were fun: I enjoyed the movie, but I also enjoyed the peek into the unknown world of film making. If you're not interested in the film making and acting extra information, just get the regular edition and enjoy the movie."
positive,"Haunting...: I was reading this book for an assignment in English, and the images that it left in my mind will remain there for a long time. The story of Tess, a truly Pure woman, facing adversities that scare the soul out of me, is a thoughtful and saddening one.The Norton Critical edition is particularily good, containing reviews and poems of and about Thomas Hardy, a major advantage when trying to understand the atmosphere that produced this novel.Though the novel is heavy in description, the description is not out of place. In fact, it is essential to the storyline.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and it made me think and reflect on the values that I believe are truly important."
negative,"Overrated Pretentious Trash: This novel is widely regarded as overrated. The plot is not that interesting, the writing style is torturous,the plot twists are predictable. It's a typical example of pre-20th century bad writing. Not to say that any book from that era is crap, but this book certainly is."
positive,"A great CD! Highly recommended!: Almost a perfect album with the exception of 4 tracks missing: Little Too Late, You Better Run, I'm Going To Follow You and Precious Time. Other than that, a great CD !"
positive,"Amazing.: 2006 has been packed with PG-13 horror films, lots of them. Then are the gore flicks (TCM the beginning), and other stuff. Finally, a good horror movie comes out in august: THE DESCENT, a British horror film with a good twist.STORY: One year after a car accedent, 6 women reunite in a cabin in the Appilachian mountains to Go on a caving expedition. When they arrive at the cave, the descent into the cave begins, and their exit is blocked. They keep praying and pushing, hoping for another exit, but a bunch of deadly creatures attack...THOUGHTS: THis is a cool movie. Good music, great s/fx, and great lighting, I thought it was cool that the only light was natural.SO see this film!"
negative,"What, exactly, is the point of this?: Get some Muddy Waters. Get some Howlin' Wolf. Get some Hound Dog Taylor. Avoid these charlatans like the plague."
positive,"An ingenious work: I have watched TCM and loved every second of it. Though it is not a gorey and disgusting as TCM II, the feeling makes it much scarier. All the special effects and the whole setting made TCM II seem like a Comedy. TCM is another story. It is about 5 friends who go to visit a relatives grave, and end up at the wrong place, at the wrong time. The mystery in the video is so scary...they all dissapear one at a time...Leatherface popping up and the least likely times. This movie willkeep you on the edge of your seat, trust me. At the end you will be dying to see what happens to the girl when they capture her!"
negative,"on the edge of your seat: Gillian claimed to be Brodick's bride to spark his curiousity. He tricked her into marriage to claim her heart. What Brodick didn't know was that in order to claim her heart, he had to give her his. He had to show her he cared.This is a truly heartstopping romance, one that I found I couldn't put down. It's about the brave, stubborn young Gillian who is the only key to finding King John's beloved jeweled box, and the only key to the toughest Hilander Lord, Brodick Sinclair's heart"
negative,Target Practice: Heyyyy I had to read this book for school and it was the worst thing I ever read. A worthless good for nothing piece of junk! Actually it is good for something. I took this book with me to rifle practice and i shot at this instead of the target. I got busted but hey it was worth it. Mail me if you want a picture of my shooting.
positive,"WHOA!!!!!!!!!: From Country Grammar to SweatSuit Nelly has done it again with the sing-a-longs, the boomin' beats , exploding lyrics. Nelly is on top there's no doubt that nelly has step back on the scene with a hit. The new single Grillz is only the beginning, not only are there the great songs before but there new songs on there with the hottest collaborations like paul wall, big gipp and St. Lunatics own Ali. Oh and lets not for get the great new song with Nortorious BIG!!! That's history in the making...So i advised anyone and everyone to go cop that new album buy nelly sweatsuit is the hottest cd out right now!!!!!!!!! DERRTY ENT!!!WE ALL WE GOT. Much love nelly's boo"
negative,"BILL AND TED GONE BRAINDEAD...: This lame excuse for a movie would make ""Dumb and Dumber"" look like Shakespeare in the Park - complete with the raunch, toilet humor, and sophmoric hi-jinx you'd come to expect from a loser of this kind. Survived the first 45 minutes before giving it the Gong (& before the early stages of permanent brain damage of my own could occur). Just a total waste of time, energy, money, and talent - if there was any. Save your money, or put it to better use by giving to your favorite charity!"
positive,"Good Product, Good Shipping, Good Price: Same product we always have used. Larger box is nice to get an entire month out of. Autoship and low pricing makes amazon a no brainer."
negative,"I'm made as hell and not going to take it anymore!: I am tired of being ripped off by these music companies. Do they really think people are so stupid as to pay money for this! The Allman Brothers rock, but what was Sony thinking. I have asked them to recall the disk, and replace mine with VHS. I urge you to do the same. Do not buy this disk!"
positive,"such a sweet product: this product is amazing, starting with the silent 120mm fan pushing air through the psu helps to cool the case, and the thought that was put into this psu, there is a little gromit around the opening where the wires come out of the psu, all the wires have protective sheaths, the connectors are top notch, and on top of it all install is very very simple, and the amount of wire connectors gives you the option of how you want to run the wires... and the option to ungrade.. or add more components... as well power levels are rock stable.. no dips. this will be the last psu you will ever need to buy"
negative,"Buyer Beware: Is a copier expected to last more than a year or two? Purchased in spring 06 - In Oct 06 I had problems with thick black lines in my scans & copies. The fix was to remove ink cartridges, disconnect machine from surge protector, powercycle three or four times, wipe copper connects, put them back in, reconnect to computer, start it all again. It worked. Problem recurred now 5/07 only this time 2 big black lines. Got out my copy of troubleshoot, tried it again to no avail, Warranty is expired and I'm told it is a hardware problem. I feel ripped off. Stay away from this HP product."
positive,"Better than most: The author has come very close to predicting the future, but we still have a long way to go.A very interesting story built around the future. Although 1984 has come and gone, the future of cameras watching our every move is very possible.As the war in Kosovo proved, some tactics are not just fiction."
positive,"A Great Movie!: I never saw this movie prior to watching it in this version, but I have to say that this was an amazing movie! I loved the fact that the movie looked at both the American and Japanese versions of the war. Of other movies that I have seen about the war this was definitely one of the most intriguing, eye-opening film that made me truly consider both sides of the war. As a lover of history this movie was amazing. If you love history and considering different points of view, this is an amazing movie that you do not want to miss. I also loved some of the special features on the blu-ray, especially the 10 extra minutes you can get on this film... it was amazing!"
positive,"Best intro to statistics -- ever!: Huff has found a catchy title to lure readers into the dry-sounding but utterly fascinating world of statistics.Packed with examples from the 1950s which seem as fresh as yesterday, this book shows how advertisers and others try to trick us by misusing statistics. ""Figures don't lie, but liars figure."" could be the unwritten motto of this book. Almost every day I see a Gee Whiz graph which makes something look like it's skyrocketing out of control before I check the scale. Then it turns out that a 5% or 10% bump looks like 600% to 1,000%. The trick is to abuse the visual impact of the graph.A company might cut wages 30%, then later increase them 30% and claim that they have restored the cut. Huff explains why this is actually a 9% pay cut! This is one of many weapons in the statisticulator's arsenal.Huff, aided by Geis's amusing and revealing illustrations, teaches us how to defend ourselves from statistical abuse, by showing us how the tricks are done."
positive,Great combination of creativity and adventure: My 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game. She plays it over and over again. She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop. She gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find Prince Stefan. The only problem is that she sings the song so much I can't get it out of my head!
positive,"Easy as falling of a log: I bought the Tivo USB network adapter at the suggestion of Tivo customer service to eliminate any possibility of hardware compatability that might arise with other adapters.I have a DSL line hook up for my computer with a 2WIRE network adapter and the installation and set up for my new Tivo was effortless. It removes any need for a separate phone line connection at the Tivo location.It has been working error free now for 6 months, reestablishing connections perfectly, even after two power outages."

negative,Did not last long: This decoration was my favorite for 3 weeks until it grew dull colored and developed blackened spots on it that resembled mold. I removed it from my tank.
positive,mega FUN for all: This product is awesome. Children as well as adult children can safely play with product and not damage it at all. If you have a very playful child (or adult) this is the best toy to have.
negative,"Poor Quality: This did not work very well, at all. I ended up throwing it out after a very short period of time. I would go with the Health o meter!"
positive,"The one to start with...: Here we see one of the most brilliant minds of the last century explaining his distaste with the Christian religion and how he came full circle to eventually embrace it. Lewis' stature can not be questioned; a man of seemingly limitless intellect, he found himself the lynchpin for many a Christian with questions and many a seeker with doubts. Lewis was an agnostic until mid-life when his unending search for truth and meaning brought his path alongside J.R.R. Tolkien's. Over time Lewis had gone from atheist to theist to eventually embracing the message of Christ. He could hardly believe it himself!This work is a classic. Originally compiled from a series of radio programs in Britain, it has been a best-seller ever since and impacted millions of lives. His insights into Natural and Moral law as well as virtue are mind-expanding to say the least. I will not presume to explain Lewis' arguments better than he, so just buy the book!"
negative,"At least it was short: Really, I don't even want to go in depth and pick the movie apart. It isn't worth my time, and I'm just doing a review to save some of you people from spending movie on a terrible movie. The plot was dumb (and not in a good kind of way with spoof movies).Two main problems:1--a parody was thrown in that had NOTHING to do with the style of movie (ex:Kill Bill)2--a parody which was ""date"" movie related was put in just for the sake of adding something in without working it in the proper way becasue the writers couldn't think of an idea or were jsut plain lazyIt's kind of hard for me to word, but hopefully people will get what I'm saying and spend their money elsewhere ...the only positive thing is this movie was short (1 hour and 13 minutes), and I really couldn't wait for it to end"
positive,"A genius creates a world.: JRR Tolkien is the author of all authors. I balk when people compare his series to Harry Potter or dare I even mention it...Twilight. JRR Tolkien has created a masterpiece with his world that he created for the Hobbit, LOTR, Children of Hurin, The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales etc.The amount of detail and historical chronologies are absolutely amazing. The stories aren't bad either. The Hobbit is probably one of his easiest reads."
negative,"Head In The Clouds Is A Very Appropriate Title For This Movie: Charlize Theron, her real life boyfriend Stuart Townsend, and Penelope Cruz are all nice to look at, and have at times shown considerable tlane in their work, Theron having won as Osca for her role in Monster.But Head In The Clouds is one of those beautifully filmed films starring a beautiful cast that trying to stay beautiful in an increasingly ugly world, particularly Europe in the 1930s. From the Spanish Civil War to World War II, the stories of these three people who share a Paris flat together is supposed to be a sweeping tragedy that shows how world events and fate can conspire to thwart true love.Instead, it shows how silly things can be when you mix hedonism, narcissism, social responsbility, and sheer stupidity. You end up caring less about the characters, andwondering more how much more trouble will they get themselves in. This was a pretty stylish waste of time for everyone involved."
negative,"Is this Grisham?: I've read most of John Grisham's books and have always enjoyed his storyteller voice and style. This book carries a very different tone and style -- it's much more cliched and predictable, and much less of a page-turner (in fact, many times it borders on boring). My biggest complaint is that he is sloppy in his storytelling, and inconsistencies, contradictions, and loose ends abound. It's nothing like his early legal thrillers, and is not even as good as his recent books like Bleachers and The Broker. If you plan to skip a Grisham book, this should be the one."
positive,"Good film & still holds up: If you never read Carrie's 1987 book with the same name then you would not be spoiled by the film.The book was good & so is the film.A lot of names in the cast. Meryl & Shirley are great as Suzanne & Doris. Several of the cast are friends of Carrie's.COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT QUAID. I am NOT a fan of his.Of course this is an older DVD. I would have thought they would have released it December 2008 when Carrie's book ""Wishful Drinking"" was released.Good to have the option of widescreen or not.I am HOWEVER, DISAPPOINTED IN THE EXTRAS. Only 1 of note is Carrie's commentary. No deleted scenes or mistakes.Ha ha Bonus trailers YOU GET TO SEE TRAILER FOR OTHER FILM NOT INTERESTEDTalent files on some of the cast-WAS NOT COMPLETE OR CURRENT.As I said, extras were a disappointment.But, you will not be disappointed in the film."
negative,Do not buy.: Capcom as of March 29 2007 has taken the game servers off line for File #2. I would highly suggest that you not buy this game as the computer AI is extremly horrible and the only decent game play came from playing with others.
negative,"Bad!: I did not enjoy this movie. The characters looked weird and didn't look at all like the ones in the first one. The Rescuers made me cry and I loved the ending, this one bored me and I couldn't watch it all the way through. Disney sequels are terrible, try Bambi II or The Rescuers, now those are great movies."
positive,"Brilliance - something many of us can relate to!: As I read ""Dress Your Family in Cuordoroy and Denim,"" I found that over and over I was relating to what Sedaris was saying. I could tell that had I been in similar situations, I would be thinking the same things, as bizarre as some of his thoughts are.His writing is superb. His wit is razor-sharp. His anecdotes are wildly entertaining. It wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as previous works, but I enjoyed it just as much. I feel like I got a better sense of the person David Sedaris instead of the extremely clever comedian David Sedaris."
negative,"Kindle edition plagued by errors: I went with the Penguin edition because it seemed to have the best reviews out of all the editions available. While I'm sure the paperback edition is fine, the Kindle version is an absolute mess.It looks like this edition was made using OCR and a scanner. Foremost among its problems is that the word ""the"" routinely appears as ""die"" or ""lie"". This happens about once per page throughout the entire book.The font size changes from paragraph to paragraph. Punctuation is often missing or wrong. Commas sometimes appear as the number ""3"" in a subscript or something else fun like that. The letter ""l"" is frequently replaced by the number ""1"" (these look very different on a Kindle).Line breaks appear where they shouldn't, and spaces are often missing between words.I've seen similar problems with other books on Kindle, though usually only for freebies. Since there are several free versions of this book available, I'd advise avoiding this one."
positive,"gorgeous dress!: I ordered this dress and recieved it the next day. It's a gorgeous dress made from a good quality material. The only problem for me was the sizing. it was way too big! When I ordered, I ordered a large based on my hip measurement needing to be that big. I should have went with the medium (which was the right size for my chest/waist measurements). Luckily, the dress fit one of the other bridesmaids perfectly so i didnt have to send it back. I reordered a medium and it's perfect!!Thanks to pacificplex for making it possible to get beautiful bridesmaid dresses that are inexpensive, and arrive quickly (the wedding is in 2 weeks!!!)"
positive,"The best book on Economics...: ...I have ever read.Excellent read for the layperson. Most relevant to our current economic crisis in America. Every politician should be required to read this book. In fact, every classroom teacher should read it, as well. Explains the mess our government has created and why its continued destructive policies are leading our country to assured economic collapse. Policies based entirely on fallacies!!"
positive,AAA+: Nice cue at a very nice price! I also have a Cuetec graphite shaft cue and they are very similar quality wise.
negative,"Cheap rubber with smeared paint, scuff marks...Not even remotely a ""collector's"" piece.: I ordered this with the intention of donating it to a Christmas toy drive thinking that a little boy or girl in the local Children's Hospital would have a lot of imaginative fun playing with a model space shuttle. When I opened the box, the space shuttle's packaging was partially opened and the space shuttle was full of dust and scuff marks. The paint job is awful, disjointed and scratched. As the package was already opened, I took the toy out to further examine it, and now my hands reak of the cheap rubber smell.This toy is garbage down to the MADE IN CHINA stamp on its underside. The only thing remotely good about it is that the patch is kind of neat but that is not nearly enough to make this worth purchasing.I would not recommend buying this product. I would be embarrassed to give this to any child, much less use it for the purpose that it was originally intended.I wish I could give it zero stars."
negative,"very cheaply made: I just received this today and while I knew to expect nothing hand crafted, I was shocked at how amazingly flimsy this thing really is. The bottom wood actually came with a huge crack; big enough to leak out all the sand. The feet were glued on with cheap glue and 3 of the 4 came off in transit. Based on the construction, I'm amazed it was even in one piece.The reason this gets 2 stars is that the accessories are pretty decent. And the sand looks fine. If this wasn't cracked in the center, I'd most likely have kept it and it would have ""worked"" for its purpose. Having said that, if you are looking for a desktop zen garden, look elsewhere."
positive,"Loved this book!: I was very happy with this product. With just mild shelf wear, this was the best money i ever spent."
positive,"Seems to be Working: I'm really excited because after three days of use, I can see some improvement in my teeth already. I've had no burning of gums and have experienced only a slight sensitivity to my teeth. I don't know if the Sensodyne I started using two weeks ago in preparation for the use of the strips had any effect but the sensitivity is very tolerable for me. Some gripes: I wish they made the upper strip longer to cover more of the upper teeth and I wish they had cut the lower strip better because you can very well see 3/4 of an inch wasted when you peel off the lower strip from its plastic backing. Will report back on the final result once I've finished the whole treatment."
positive,Batman Begins: I went crazy in the theater watching this movie. Would highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of Batman.
positive,"The Hunger for Healing: After being part of a hunger for healing twelve step group, I see more of the wisdom of J. Keith Miller's words. I may not always agree with what he says in the videos that are part of the series, but reading them for myself and letting the meaning and how to use that in my own life as needed sink in, helps me in ways I didn't know they would. The book is a great connection to the videos and a twelve step group. - even for Christians who don't think they have any 'problems'!"
positive,"GOOD QUALITY: This VCI disc is good. The image is mostly crisp and clear, say above 90%. There are a few frames that are fuzzy and dull. There is no hissing or dropout in the sound. There is a comedy short with Leon Errol. It's image sound is also good.As the other reviewers stated the story and acting are top-notch. Even on the short. I have one other VCI disc and there is a Leon Errol short on it. I had never heard of him. He is actually pretty funny."
negative,Functionally worthless as of June 2009: The dual tuner feature won't work on this model TiVo after June 2009. Don't buy it.
positive,"...: Talk about non stop energy. System Of A Down's sophmore release, ""Toxicity"" has people talking, and talking loud. Hailed as ""one of the best albums, EVER"" by many critics, SOAD shuts down the skeptics and the critics who thought they could not top their debut album.Not only does it top the album, it blows it out of the water. Serj and he boys have really done their job here, and offer a unique brand of metal that stands out from most of the nu-metal/rapcore sludge out there.A must-have for all rock fans, ""Toxicity"" will have you pumped up for a long time."
positive,"I like this book pretty much.: I read it last summer. I like it. My favorite character is Jo, the tomboy. She dosen't like any thing about being a girl. They all miss their father. Jo miss's him. She think it's so dreadful to be poor."
positive,"The Clan Of The Cave Bear, and the other books were great.: In this book, you travel back in time to a world without the knowledge we have today. In some cases it was better back then. The world was fresh, unspoiled, and there were a group of people that called themselves:The Clan Of The Cave Bear. Ayla, the beautiful heroine, is left orphened in a strange world after her ""tribe"" gets killed by a natural disaster. As Ayla grows, she strugles to learn the ancient ways of the clan. She then has a son. When there is a new leader, he banishes her. To find out more details read the book! Even though I started the series when I was in the sixth grade, last year, I love this series, and have already finished it. I'm dying to read the next one."
positive,"Great Film!!: I had no idea what to expect going into this film (just watched it on DVD a few minutes ago). I had heard some negativity from fans of the comic (I've never read the comic myself); and it certainly had the potential to be a flop. But I absolutely loved it! The plot was interesting, the acting was good, the effects were great -- and there was not a boring moment. What could have been a hack, predictable plot was always surprising and interesting. Hats off to the writers and director -- with all the crap horror/thriller that gets on the big screen, this was a welcome change."
positive,sanctuary second season: The season I received came from Amazon and was in excellent conditiion and on time. I enjoyed this season very much as I did not have to see the commericals. The extra were interesting
negative,"Not a good phone: This phone didn't meet our expectations. We used it in the kitchen for a long time, and found that it is very hard to get clean, even with normal cleaning fluids.Battery life is an issue for this phone. Two new batteries lasted 9 months before they wouldn't hold a charge.When power goes out, there is no electronic memory for time, so when we have a power outage, which is frequent, we have to reset the clock. The outgoing message doesn't erase, so why not the clock???There is no speakerphone capability either."
positive,"Perfect replacement: I had looked at these exact replacement pieces at the baby store near me, but these were cheaper. They fit my Medela Pump in style advanced perfectly."
negative,"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!: I usually don't mind having to read and I do enjoy a lot of books, but Something Wicked This Way Comes is awful. It is way too descriptive and very boring at parts. Save your time and money! DON""T READ IT!!"
negative,"Not very wicked.: I bought this assuming to be enthralled by a 'dark carnival'; to be a bit frightened at the least, but I was more taken aback by the repetition of bradbury's wording. He uses words with like meanings in long strings and it got old rather quickly. Some parts are like reading entries in a Thesaurus; I skipped over these ""defining"" paragraphs/sentences after the first couple chapters.The book was not 'wicked'; it isn't even as scary as some R.L. Stine books I dug up recently and those aren't even a fraction of the size and depth this attempts. With the name ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"", I was expecting wickedness worded out; twisted thoughts and evilness dealt out by a ominous force. No deal. The book is rather tame - by its name I was expecting Steven King but instead got Walt Disney.It's a child's book. Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it."
positive,"Still Good After All These Years...: ALthough there's no surround sound, this is a very good show. I bet it'll startle your kids at the end, if they've never watched it before."
negative,"Something's Wrong Here: Bought the book for about $15 from Amazon, not paying too close attention to the details. Reviews are glowing and give one the impression that the book comes with CD or CDs. (I said I didn't pay attention.) I was waiting eagerly - heading for France next year and would like to be able to find my way around without resorting to mime. So the book has arrived and not only are no CDs included, they are available on Amazon for $190 additional!?!????!!! I'm trying to think of some cute little joke to make about it, but sorry, it doesn't seem funny."
positive,"Nicely Done -- Wish He'd Write Another: This novel is more enjoyable than the Flanders Panel, but still not up to the level of the Fencing Master or his recent series, the Captain Alatriste books. The characters are well drawn, the setting comes alive, and the story flows. There are a few sections of the book that need some more editing to make them a bit more crisp, but I cannot tell if that is due to the translation or is in the original. The only real disappointment came when I finished the book: I wish there was a follow-up.J. Avellanet, Co-Founder of Cerulean Associates LLC"
positive,Just what I wanted: It had all of his greatest books like tell tale heart. And the table of contents worked just fine. I RECOMMEND for teachers.
negative,"too heavy: This already adds bulk to a heavy pda, but if you want to protect it this is the way to go."
negative,Yoo has no clue!: The 2 biggest mistakes made by government in my lifetime are Congress giving away war powers in 1965 and 2002. The constitution holds that declaring war is the responsibility of the Congress. If the Executive has grounds for war let him/her present them and Ccongress vote. Twice I have seen Congress abdicate this important power with disasterous results. This is just one of many examples why Yoo has no clue.
negative,"Not a real collection boxset.: I like the movies and I want to add this trilogy to my DVD collection. However, this set is not a collection boxset that I am looking for. They are 3 separate spiderman movies in their own packages, and bundled together in a newly design cardboard box and called them ""Trilogy"".The worst is that they are the unsold inventory which they applied white stickers to cover the barcode in the back of each box. I felt cheated by Sony Pictures. They should have done a better job by creating a real boxset in a nice package with some additional materials.If you are looking for a nice collection boxset, please skip this set."
negative,"Plagiarism... almost.: This story steals from many classics. I suppose it isn't an exact ripoff but the similarities between this and other classics such as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and so on are so pitifully obvious. I read this to my kids and certainly they enjoyed it, not recognizing the plots, ideas and so on. I also don't think it was well written, there is never any doubt that Eragon will make it and be just fine. The dialogue is pretty bad.I can only give it two stars and that's because the kids did like it. Taken for what it is, a kids book, it is okay but just barely. It's the plagiarism that is so obvious and sickening. I think he made enough changes for it all to be legal, but it is still pretty pathetic.Kids read this instead :The Hobbit"
positive,A very important book: This is a powerful book. It is written in a clear and engaging style. It is important that people know about the human rights abuses going on in Sudan. Mr. Bok's story does this in a meaningful and moving way.
negative,"Wrong DVD for Disk 2: Very angry with product. The main disk we wanted was changed with on that featured John Goodman as the Santa in the year without a Santa Claus. NOT, what we ordered nor was it children appropriate."
negative,"Not the best version for this classic.: This transfer feels so incomplete compared to the version I used to watch throughout my childhood. This version is choppy, with random bits skipping parts of dialogue and on loop. The worst part of this DVD is the coloring, which is horrible. The contrast is FAR too dark and this causes the scenes to become lost and, more often than not, you end up watching a pitch black screen and wondering if it's your computer or DVD player. It ISN'T. It's the DVD. Brand new or not, it is not worth the ten dollars you would spend for it."
positive,Design Director: This product should fill the bill in an Interior/Universal Design project we are finishing. This will be modified to fit into the custom sized generous wall pockets for our wheel chair accessible shower room.
negative,"Rapists make unappealing heros: No matter if the ""hero"" was nice and appologetic or not after the first rape, which he was not he was a JERK the whole time it seemed, our heroine was still raped. Don't they have syndromes for victims who fall in love with their captors? Well, I liken this story to that. I like Jennifer Blake but she seems to like rape scenes for some reason. Not very romantic material."
negative,"Boring: Personally I thought this book was dried out and boring. I had to read this book for my English class and I did not enjoy it. It seemed like it took 50 pages to tell about how the character was hungery. I am no expert in novels, but I have read plenty of more enjoyable and worthwhile books. On a good note, there was a lot of interesting facts on whaling, sailing, and survival. I probably enjoyed learning all the facts more than the storyline itself."
positive,Def by Temptation: I'm and old horror junkie.. This was a back in the day classic with alot well know actor/actress. Well worth it..Tony..
positive,"Sounds from Heaven: It is no coincidence that this CD was released on November 22nd., which is associated with St. Cecilia's Day. In John Dryden's Ode to St. Cecilia, he portays St. Cecilia as having a voice so pure that when an angel heard it, he appeared before her, mistaking earth for heaven. This is the best way to describe this Enya CD. I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to be uplifted to the sounds of heaven in these troublesome times!"
positive,I am pleased: Receiving this product was right on time. My opinion of the book was very informational for me.
positive,"Excellent Service: Product arrived in expected time, and in excellent condition. Will use this service again if need arises."
negative,"unwatchable: however, being somewhat obsessive, i couldn't seem to break free...jejune, almost entirely empty, and nearly identical to a very bad and lengthy sitcom episode, except for the absence of the obligatory 50s laugh track...in the first two hours of my promised and blissful afterlife, i may very well look back upon the final two hours, and realize they were wasted in advance on this deeply malformed creature feature."
negative,"lord of the flies bokk review: ""The lord of the flies"" By william Golding, is in my opinion one of the most boring book i have ever read in my whole life. but on the other hand it did have alot to say about our ""humanly nature"" most of it was true.This book was like a little summary of our violent nature throughout history. But overall it was terably boring!!!!!"
positive,Greg's Review: I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper. I don't want to spoil this edition of Coyote Ugly for anybody because in my opinion the extended scenes are worth it. Enjoy.
negative,"Collectors Beware: Ok so the world is a big place and it's full of strange people but I am surprised that anyone could be very impressed with the ""Leatherette"" editions of LOTR and The Hobbit. These editions are not ones I can imagine any discerning collector would want to own.I bought the two books because I am not a fan of Alan Lee's work and I couldn't find any other current hardback editions that used Tolkien's original drawings, (as the ""Leatherette"" Hobbit does). The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble."
positive,"SUPERB: I love it and so does my 3 year old son. I bought him a karoke machine for Christmas so we could sing it. On the way to work/school every morning we sing ""I love you baby"".I'm proud of Lauryn and happy for her. Keep up the superb work. It was always something about her that I knew she'd be a success."
positive,"Nice, but not indispensable: There is nothing to complain about concerning this album. Desmond lives up to his self-imposed ""slowest alto player""--playing slow tempos with long spaces between notes. Truth be told, the real standout on this recording is Jim Hall, who plucks away on guitar with superb technique. A nice outing by Desmond and Hall.Paul Desmond (alto sax)Jim Hall (guitar)Gene Wright (bass)Gene Cherico (bass) track 5Connie Kay (drums)"
positive,"I love all of these books from Jean M. Auel.: Very well researched, splendid stories, each book is a surprise and a joy. Read them, they are definitively very good."
negative,"Another one bites the dust..: Yet another cheesy, cliche horror movie about a bunch of dumb idiots who die one after the other, sometimes in cool ways. Nothing creative, nothing interesting, and nothing original. STUPID! I found it hard not to laugh. Yeah, these creatures are supposed to be BLIND, but yet they seem to be able to see just fine, and these dumb bimbos don't shut up. I love how ""horror"" movies like this contradict themselves at every turn. The ending is nothing but laughable. It's hard to draw the line between horror and comedy here. Just a pure joke, nothing more, unless you're another little MTV airhead who finds this kind of crap scary or entertaining."
negative,"Pages are in the wrong order: The book's cover is in good condition and the pages are in good condition too. Very little wear. The problem is, about 4 chapters in the pages are in the wrong order. I've found this very frustrating - I keep having to flip back and forth through the pages. The seller should have made this apparent in the item's discription."
positive,"Works well: The case works well for transportation to and from the gun range, keeps my firearm in a secured position. That being said, I would not use a lock on this plastic case, it is made out of a thin plastic and can easily be broken into.Well worth the $11 price tag for simple transportation."
positive,"Lonely: The spanking scene in this book has become controversial. Well, it IS fiction. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book to my grandchildren ages 3 and 6. They loved it too. The photos are amazing."
positive,As exciting as the music in it...: Sarah and Helen are fun and cute in this movie. The dancing is fun to watch too.The music makes you want to get up and dance too. I recommend this for your personal library.
positive,"nice: I'm very happy with these overall. Good quality sound for NC 'phones. They reduce most background noise down to something way less bothersome.My only gripes: the huge battery brick you have to clip to yourself somewhere and is not so good for walking around, I wish they'd expand about one more click for people with huge heads... the case is solid but it's kinda awkward to cram everything in there (it should include a slot for spare batteries).Glad I didn't pay 3X the price for Bose."
positive,"My favourite: I first read this book when I was twelve, and it's been my favourite ever since. Now I am a 19 year old Egyptology student, and I still read this book now and then. I am amazed at how historical accurate the book is."
positive,"Vocally obnoxious and musically brutal: Start to finish, it's like Judas Priest on steroids and a singer that is so over the top on his highs it's like a banshee having a seizure. The music is heavy, catchy and intricate and his vocals soar over it all making it ten times more intense and fun, yes fun to listen to. Some disagree and think his vocals are TOO OTT but it all comes down to personal opinion. It's like a metal opera that is very dramatic. It can go from vengeance to a very emotional state from song to song and it takes you on a journey. You know those crazy Italians. They're intense in everything they do and it is all over this cd. I bought this purely because I thought the cover was ridiculously awesome. I mean, a centurion holding a pump action sawed off shotgun? Sold."
positive,"Works great: I've been using this stuff almost daily since I got married two and a half years ago. We couldn't bear to ask our friends and family to buy us overpriced cookware, but we wanted high performance, so we registered for this instead. No regrets. Though you'll need more pans than this eventually, I have zero complaints for this as a starter set."
negative,"Uranium ??? Please !!: I thought this was the perfect fit for my nuklear powered car and bought a dozen of this. Little did I realize that the radioactivity would be so low that I can barely run the car and not be able to launch the counter-traffic missiles or the retroguns designed to take down chasing cops.I dont want to get started on the time machine. It malfunctioned just when I had set the year to 2064 (just to see if my girl would be with me till that time). A serious of beeps with warnings of insufficient power and the whole damn machine went up in smokes killing my children and maiming my grandma. The emissions bamaged my drain my face my vital organs and my hair. now i am bald, have effeminate voice, runny nose and an infantile p.e.n.i.s.oh yea. my girl left me.Don't recommend this stuff."
positive,"Wear it out!: Last week, I had my wallet pickpocketed, had a love meltdown- all while my father went in for emergency surgery. It is to Cibo Matto's unending credit that I somehow could not get their unusual, uncategorizable album out of my head. I sang the songs constantly to myself at some very inopportune times. The spirit of ""Stereotype A"" was so tender and fun that, in spite of the fact I probably would have prefered to immerse myself in some moody heroin-induced lyric of Millennial agony,I had to be a part of it. I retained a marginally good attitude. My wallet was found and my dad is going to be okay, (I'm still annoyed with my love interest.)and now that things are better I am absolutely wearing Stereotype A out. This is one of the most listenable and brilliant albums in years. Thank you Cibo Matto!"
negative,"If you loved both the TV series, you'll HATE this.: I thought this movie was garbage, for the main reason of what they did to one of the main characters of the mission impossible TV series. This character of the TV series would not be like the one in the movie. I don't think the writers of the movie ever saw the series. If i could give this movie less that one star i would."
positive,"Beatle mutation music at it's pop cosmic best!: ""Subrosa Subway"" hooked me right in. ""Calling Occupants"" a masterpiece. No one thought it could be done...the Beatles sound in an experimental way, but my goodness, an attention and care to arranging was astounding. No mop top hype to hide behind.The fact that they wanted it released with no individual song credits made it feel like a group effort. As they wanted no one to look at the album in none other way than an experience. And they the achieved with flying colours. This album is the reason I even got into songwriting or noticed songwriting as an art form.Indeed a special album for me all time."
positive,"My daughter loves this toy: I bought this for Christmas. It was somewhat challanging to put together properly, but after that it was quite fun for my five year old. I know when she plays with this due to the sound fx."
positive,electric thumb piano: For fans of Congotronics this is a must buy. Konono No1 makes better music with car parts and other scraps than rock groups with thousands of dollars in amps and twenty piece drum kits. Konono No1's music takes you into its groove and never lets go. Like it says on the sleeve PLAY LOUD! The ancesters are surely pleased.
positive,"Ghost In The Ground: This literate city follows with enthusiasm, the entropy and self contained decline within all things John E. Douglas.Today we publically celebrate Amazon.coms 20th anniversary, with John nowhere to be found. Sadly at Barnes & Noble, among the bottom feeders he begs. Upon a low traffic floor shelf, squeezed between his FBI founders favorite pastime, and Mother Natures firm hand, a fossil record of John Douglas."
negative,"Print is much smaller than I was expecting: I bought the ESV Holy Bible (Contemporary Design) Paperback version, and it's very disappointing. Though the cover design is nice, the print is much smaller than I expected, considering the digital previews of inside the book made it look like the print was a good size."
positive,"Classic read: A great story that I've always known of, but never read. A must read for any pirate story fan and adventure lover."
positive,"TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: This movie is truly horrifying!It still has effects on people after 28 years!That one girl must have had some serious therapy after the filming of this film, because of the torture she suffered, even if its just acting! This movie doesnt show a lot of gore on screen, but gets scares out of the viewers, for the tense, suspenseful scenes.If you havent seen this movie you must! This is a movie everyone has to buy!This is claimed to be a true story, although some people just say its a fiction story, but is sorta like based on the true Ed Gein story.So I don't know. But I have heard more people saying it was true!Anyways just buy this movie for your collection!"
negative,"Unsatisfying!: This book is a shame because J.R.R. Tolkien writes very well; but the topic is not interesting at all. How can you expect one to read about dwarves fighting a dragon, dwarves going to war with elves, 'Wood-elves' imprisoning dwarves?, or the evil, horrible 'Wargs'!? You can either like or dislike a book like this."
positive,Pinocchio a classic gift and fun: i purhased to replace my old vhs. this is a classic that we all love and now seeing it again on dvd is amazing! it is a family movie and truly inpsiring story of making choices in Pinocchio! Jimmeny Cricket never lets you down!!! thank you to the seller for a grand overall experience in all areas.
positive,"Great read: Great book of course, like the illustrations here. Not happy with how maps look on kindle and how some of the poetry lines formatted, but all in all decent kindle version."
positive,"Tender, wonderful movie: I can't go on & on in quadruple paragraphs like some reviewers do, but I can say that this movie touched me & brought tears to my eyes several times. Ian McKellan is just wonderful. The scene where he talks about the loss of his friend in WWI is so moving. The ending is bittersweet...you felt that the Brendan Fraser character would never know such a friendship again."
negative,"80's and 90's children will be heartbroken...this has been completely ruined by new artwork...bring the old stuff back!: Half, maybe a bit more than half, of the fun and uniqueness of this wonderful collection was the awesome terrifying artwork...If it still had the old artwork I would definitely buy this for my future children...but alas, it has been replaced by generic boring illustrations similar to every other book...I am 20 now, but these amazing stories along with the scary artwork will always be in my memory and I remember them very fondly. they did not scar my memory or scare me to insanity. They sure were scary but not enough to completely get rid of them! I will never buy this version. I'd rather pay for a used copy of the older better version but never this one...I am kind of heartbroken they got rid of it as it was so perfect the way it was. The parents who complained about the old artwork should be ashamed."
positive,fisher king: Awesome movie and it looks great kn bluray. The seller was super quick and it was packaged great. I've seen the movie several times but watching it on bluray was brestthanks sgain
negative,"Not for beginners!: I am just beginning to study French and according to the reviews, this course would have been a good start. Not so. It starts out with full conversations, too indepth, too detailed and doesn't have the English easily viewable to even follow along.I have found two other French Study Lessons at the Public Library which are much better suited for true beginners."
negative,"this is a waste of time!!!: the movies on this disc might be good,but from the very poor transfers here(droped audio,picture drop-out and freese pictures ,and all the movies were very very dark almost not watchable)you would never know. skip this mess and look for these movies elsewere!!!"
negative,"Kind of hard to believe: This book was harder for me to get through than most. I found it a little plodding and contrived. The historical content and language were poor - I prefer to read historical novels that at least attempt to keep with the language and characteristics of the time. This one did not. I found Gillian to be a little weak in just succumbing to Brodick's wishes and getting caught or in trouble whenever she didn't. Some central characters, such as the little boys who were the initial start of some of the trouble and Gillian's sister Christen, were not dealt with to my satisfaction. It is almost like they were created, then forgotten and then brought back again just so they could be wrapped up.While I won't say this is a bad book, it was somewhat disappointing. Be prepared to suspend your belief and get through some plodding moments and you can manage to enjoy this book for the most part. I just didn't after a while."
negative,".: Mm. Truly a poor and silly film. If you took an episode of the old series and drained out everything that was interesting, and replaced it all with cliches, bad dialogue, flat characters, a boring story, and gimmicky, over-the-top ""plot twists"" -- you'd have this. There's just nothing remotely good about it -- *except* for the famous scene in which Cruise is suspended in that high-security room trying to retreive -- a disk or something? (It's been a while.) This one scene -- is very good. Crafty, suspenseful, and quite well edited from what I remember. If you decide to rent this movie (god forbid you *buy* it!) -- I would recommend fast-forwarding until you reach this scene, watching it, and then moving on, to spend the remainder of your day or evening in a more productive and enriching fashion. You might want to take a peek at the climax action sequence too, it's fairly original (although WAY over-the-top) and pretty to see."
negative,"2 times broken!: We bought this blender/food processor combo last month and after about a week on the second use of the food processor, noticed that the plastic latches that hold the lid on the food processor were broken. Amazon happily replaced the appliance. However, when unpacking the new items, the bottom of the food processor mechanism came off. We've promptly returned the second blender for a refund this time. I guess we'll look for another kind/brand."
negative,"great features...poor quality: I bought this lamp because it had all the features I was looking for...HOWEVER...the quality is very flimsy and poorly constructed. For $166 I expected something more sturdy, but it is what it is.I have this in my nursery next to the glider. I love the dimmer lighting, the reading light, and the shelf. Although I am not too sure the shelf can handle much more than a glass of water. I have it standing on carpet and decided to use a wire wall mounting bracket to make sure the lamp does not tip over. If it was placed on a hard surface, maybe the leaning/swaying wouldn't be as bad.Next time I will read the reviews...as I am now noting that others have experienced the poor quality."
positive,Handy little tool: This is a handy tool that is small but has a lot of features that the more expensive stuff has. Again great for travel.
positive,"Excellent book for already-competent writers: As the product description does not list the contents of the book, I will:Chapters1) Writing and the study of English composition2) Good writing as composition3) Narration and description4) Exposition and argumentation5) Paragraphs6) Sentences and words: style7) Style: correctness8) Style: economy and increment9) Style: pure movement10) Style and composition11) Methods and applicationsThis book is an insightful guide to writers seeking to increase the cohesiveness and progression of their writing. I would not recommend this to someone looking to learn to write, but to someone looking to write more effectively. It pulls together all styles of writing and discusses the elements common to these styles that make writing more effective. The working premise of this book is that effective writing achieves what you wish it to achieve, and that clarity and progression should be a writer's primary concerns."
negative,"For once, the movie was better.: I purchased this book after seeing, and truly enjoying, the movie. Unfortunately, my favorite elements of the movie were completely absent from the book. I did enjoy thinking about preparing many of the dishes from MtaoFC as I read, but I continually missed the movie's lovely connections to Julia Child's history and her development as a chef, writer, and teacher.In reflection, it seems to me that Julie Powell fell into a project that captured the imagination of many, and which had a profound impact on her own life. That project, however, did not make her a good writer or an inspiring person. The screenplay writers, on the other hand, accomplished both these goals and made me want to buy Julia Child's MtaoFC, read more about her biography, and cook for my friends and family.Julia captured my interest; Julie, not so much."
negative,"Lacks spirit: I guess the title says it all, step-by-step. Too mechanistic and simplified. Does not delve deep into the true nature of the beauty of women and orgasm. Like something you'd read in a Mens health magazine or cosmopolitan."
negative,Not the best: I think that the book is boring for the most part but it is a really old book so I understand why I hated it.
positive,Managing Your Time: Managing Your Time is a very useful book that addresses the real problems which most of us face in everyday life concerning our busy schedules. The solutions are workable and doable. I found this book to be very informative.
negative,WAKE UP PEOPLE!: there is a child molester named jeffrey jones in this movie i would not want a child watching this movie you need to read who is in it and what they have done.
negative,"More than Memes?!?: Not since I was first transproted in my adventures during the ""Spring Break With Melanie Nuntia"" have I been so moved in realms of wonder by Sundiata.I can only imagine this is the secret narrative behind the events in Occitania (France). The Librarian Melanie Nuntia is a living representative of the goddess Tanith. The Serpent Goddess empowering young women.Knowledge of the anicent ways is no longer the prize of bearded old Masons. The sword is in the hands of the sisters...These are more than just Memes that Sundiata weaves into this wonderful work, these are living archytyopes hat are going to shapre the future of human kind.Having played ""The Great Game"" ARG I have learned a thing or two about he willingness of the reptilians to share their knowledge with average human beings...that may be saying a lot for a ""game"" but all I can say is that the ""universe"" as we know it is at play..."
positive,Better than the Dark Knight (1): Absolutely outstanding movie...thought it was better than the Dark Knight 1. I highly recommend this movie. I also love the fact that an on demand Amazon online version came with the movie. I was able to watch the movie instantly without having to wait for it to be delivered (extremely fast I might add).
positive,"Fun!: Really a fun, fun book. Reason our main character is a bright but odd fifteen year old with a family history thats even odder. Her Mom has spent 18 years running from Reason's grandmother and has dragged Reason all across Australia and filled her head with all sorts of misinformation about magic and Reasons GrandMother.There are one or two odd things that almost fail in the book, but really one of the most fun books for teens out there."
positive,"The best war film I have ever seen: My wife and I have watched this series about twice a year for the past 3 years. The characters seem like old friends. When ever we see a cast member in another role we comment on it.It is superbly done and is a credit to Tom Hanks, Stephen Spielberg, and to HBO. It is the best film on WW II I have ever seen. I feel it rivals Saving Private Ryan. Each time we watch it we see something new.It is the most watched film in my collection. The tin case is classy too"
positive,"I like it: Good common sense approach to the many things that keep us uninspired. Mr Chandler has done a great job at breaking down the problem areas that many people experienced and keep them from moving forward.There is a good progression through the various difficulties and a way to not only beat them but to get on top of things and stay there. I love this kind of work as it inspires me to get in motion rather than just sit around.John BlakelyAutor of ""Motivation, Get it, Keep it"""
negative,"Too bland...: This novel takes forever to get to the point of the story. I couldn't even finish it! Try PRIDE AND PREJUDICE instead - at least it has a plot. Speaking of which, I couldn't understand the plot of EMMA, if there even was one. Try another Austen book."
positive,"Phenomenal: After just listening to a few clips of this CD on the internet made me want this one. Now after hearing the entire CD, I am soooo glad to have one!!!! Clay's voice is truly remarkable, the lyrics great, and the music is beautiful. I recommend this highly, you won't be disappointed."
negative,waste of money: i bought this for my kids to sharpen their pencils for school. we have had it since august 2010 this thing is truly a piece of junk. It wont sharpen straight now it wont sharpen at all wont stay still. This company should be ashamed to sell this product.
negative,"Great shape, great anchors that hold it down, terrible design for the elastic rope that keeps it snug and water out.: The sandbox cover for the Frame It All Sandbox hexagonal has some problems. The shape is great, the anchors that hold it down to the frame are great. The problem is the elastic rope that holds it snug are held together with a plastic grip and all of them broke. Some of the elastic rope disappeared into the seam of the cover.So the rope is not holding the cover snug and water gets in. Very disappointing as it was so close to working so well, and yet so far away.Frame It All Sandbox Cover, Hexagonal"
positive,Cosmic mysteries: This DVD is not an updated version of the older one...as I have the older DVD I passed this new one on to a relative who teaches science from the Biblical perspective. I was disappointed there was no new information on this DVD...this is a difficult subject and theory to understand but Dr. Humphreys does an excellent job.
negative,"Where's the finish!: I enjoy Hillerman. I like the weaving of cultural information into fine mysteries. But what was he thinking with Hunting Badger? That no one would notice that he shipped the book to his publisher without completing it? It was the most frustrating Hillerman book I've read. HE NEVER FINISHED THE BOOK. ALL KINDS OF STORY LINES ARE LEFT HANGING. The writing style is classic Hillerman, and wonderfully entertaining, but you expect a story to have an ending! It was interesting that in the promo for his memoir (the publisher should have used the pages completing the story), he refers to a book he wrote that had an inadequate ending. He quotes the publisher telling him ""we want to publish it if you can write a better last chapter."" In Hunting Badger, Hillerman should have had as good a publisher."
negative,"Poetry.com is a Scam!: Hmm...My wife is ALSO the first poem in the book!? If you look close, one finds that they bound in the first few pages after the fact. It seem that anyone who submits a poems and then buys the book gets the first page. This type of shady organization that preys on the dreams of courageous writers deserves not a moment of consideration."
negative,"Abysmal: I was quite disappointed after reading Autumn. Maybe it was the large anticipation I had incorporated when purchasing the book, thinking that post-apocalyptic scenarios were ""my kind of thing"" (and they still are). However, Moody's book was very poorly written. Not only did I encounter numerous grammatical mistakes, but there was absolutely no connection with the characters. It was almost like, ""here are the characters, now you must try and relate to them and follow through with their overly obvious situations."" I felt no sympathy with Carl's death, or any other middle school -written events that occurred. Overall, this was a terrible book in the sense that there was no captivation whatsoever. Although the abysmal stance of Autumn, Moody is an amateur, and will hopefully progress in later writings."
positive,"Reliable, good value: I have owned this DVD/CD 5 disc changer for nearly 2 years and used it daily for both DVDs and CDs. No reliability problems with the machine or the remote. It is true that the remote is not very intuitive, and some time needs to be invested in reading the owner's manual. It's also true that automatic disc changing and programming is not speedy. If you master the remote, you rarely have to touch the machine except to change discs, so the ""cheap button feel"" mentioned in other reviews becomes a non-issue. I disagree with the few reviews that note poor picture quality. I do agree with most of the other reviewers who approve of the picture quality. It's important to understand that the progressive scan won't help the picture quality unless you also invest in a component video output cable, HD-ready TV, and know how to use the remote to set up the progressive scan feature. The price on this unit makes it a very good value."
positive,"Great western series: Lonesome Dove: The Series (and its subsequent season 2, Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years) continues the Lonesome Dove saga. It is well-acted and well-written and thoroughly enjoyable. If you like westerns, and especially if you liked the Lonesome Dove miniseries, you'll probably love this TV series."
positive,"Roll up for the Mystery Tour: This is the soundtrack to the Beatles much reviled television movie. Actually, the first side of the album featured all the songs from the film. The second side contained the a and b sides of all the singles the Beatles released in 1967 (other than ""I am the Walrus"", which was on the first side of the album). There are a lot of great songs here, of course, but the album doesn't hold up that well as a cohesive unit. It feels more like a collection of songs than an actual album. Of course, you can't complain too much when you get great songs like ""I am the Walrus"", ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""Penny Lane"" and ""All You Need is Love"". The one track I will criticize is ""Flying"". I hope my fellow Beatlemaniacs will forgive me, but I have to say that this is one of the boringest instrumentals ever recorded. Regardless of that, this album is still well worth purchasing."
positive,"Good book: It is definately worth reading. An adopted farm boy with no past becomes a secret hero. His secret is discovered by another who bears a similar secret. The older trains the younger, while guiding him to hidden rebels who continue his training. His popularity and deeds grow throughout the book and the series."
negative,"poor quality control: I have ordered two of these calipers, but not intentionally: the first was damaged, so I returned it and ordered another. Guess what? The second one was damaged, too.The first had a cracked shaft (the shaft is what the piece with the LCD slides along), and the second has a bent shaft. I unfortunately waited too long (> 30 days) to return the bent one, so I guess I'm stuck with it. You pretty much get what you pay for here: a cheap way to pretty accurately measure stuff. For most of my needs, even with the inaccuracy from the bent shaft, it'll probably do fine. It does irk me that both were damaged, however, so I'm dinging it a few stars."
negative,Primarily for Ned Oldham fans: Ned Oldham has been popping-up as a musician/background vocalist on Will Oldham/Palace records for some time now. Beware - this album portrays an opposite relationship. It is primarily a Ned Oldham record with a very occasional insertion of Will's voice mixed in the background. If you want to hear Will's voice - do not waste your money unless you're a completist.
positive,laugh and learn about childbirth: Fantastic!! My husband and I found this DVD very informative and easy to follow along. We both felt very comfortable watching in our own living room. ;) The instructor puts you at ease. Only thing I would add is more footage of actual birth. (although i still feel nothing more could have been learned by seeing this actual footage) My husband strongly disagrees. He found lack of footage to be quite comforting.
negative,sharp edges: Love the design but the raised relief on the band itself is very sharp and catches on clothing and can easily scratch skin.
positive,"See it: For those, like me, who were educated in the art of beautiful movie-making by Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightly, you will be happy with this film. At times it is obvious that Becoming Jane is made in the image of Pride and Prejudice, at other times it is uneven, and lacks spontaneity. It's not nearly as good, but it is beautiful nonetheless. It satisfied my hunger for more of the same. I loved Anne Hathaway. Her prescence and beauty made me a romantic fool wishing that I were somehow the one man man who could have won Jane Austen's heart."
positive,"THE HARMONIOUS HOLLIES: This self-titled effort from the British band offers their masterful harmonies on an eleven track album.The trio of Allan Clarke, Tony Hicks and Terry Sylvester share most of the compositions, with the exception of the album's biggest hit, THE AIR THAT I BREATHE, written by Albert Hammond.The only real misstep is the obvious LONG COOL WOMAN clone, THE DAY CURLY BILLY SHOT DOWN CRAZY SAM MCGEE, which even copies LCW's opening guitar riff. However, the remaining tracks offer enjoyable examples of the Hollies vocal and musical expertise.In addition to the aforementioned AIR, I like the airy mystique of PICK UP THE PIECES, the harmonic rock of IT'S A SHAME IT'S A GAME, TRANSATLANTIC WESTBOUND JET, and DON'T LET ME DOWN. Ballad-wise, DON'T LET ME DOWN is sharp and the 50ish doo-wop sound of LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND is a nice change of pace.Overall, an enjoyableslice of 70s pop."
positive,"Best Hd experience yet: I own both formats and have viewed more movies on both than I probably should!!! I have to date been more impressed with my movies on hd dvd for picture and audio quality until I Robot, I enjoyed the movie when it came out and took the opportunity to rent the BD release and all I can say is WOW!!! the picture quality is on par with the top tier releases I have viewed! The audio (dts master) is possibly the best I have experienced, clear, crisp, lifelike surround which combined with the picture quality and to me an excellent story makes this overall experience an A+++++! If you are a fan of sci-fi this is a must have for your HD collection!"
negative,"over-hyped: C'mon. I wanted to like this. I love primitive music, from the Sonics to the Ramones. But the Shaggs music is beyond primitive. It's garbage. And it's not of the ""it's so bad, it's good"" variety. It's so bad, it's terrible."
positive,"Great Book: This book states in plain english how a client/server product works, from theory to real world application. The author describes the history of computer information systems, databases, and program development. He takes each subject from humble beginnings as a technical brainchild to today's ( 1995 ) systems, continuing to tomorrows forecasted technology. This is a no nonsense author, who doesn't seem swayed by new technologies and ""silver bullets"". His philosophy is down to earth and in plain english. I couldn't put this book down, even while reading it in 2002. The history lesson presented in this book is worth more than Amazon is asking for this book. Buy it today.It isn't technical enough to be used as a manual, however it is still a good read."
negative,Would Not Recommend: Bought this for my wife to replace an old cup warmer she had that died. She was totally disappointed with the product. It was not effective at keeping coffee in her mug warm.
positive,The all time best movie: This movie has got to be the best movie I've ever seen. Nicole (Reese Witherspoon) is very similar to my character. I thought this movie was very realistic and sends out a good message . What bothers me is how so many people were putting Alyssa Milano down because she played a so-called 'slut'. They have no right to put down her character like that. I thought she did a great job acting as well as all the other actors and actresses in the movie.
negative,"Watered Down!: You should be ashamed selling this crapola.I will never buy from this vendor again. I have purchasedplenty of fragrances from Amazon and ebay. This producthas been tampered with, I can literally see that thebottle was opened because there are little pry marks on the bottom.The scent literally wears off by the time you get out the door.Amazon should give you the boot!"
positive,"A fascinating and ""reader friendly"" historical study.: A Peaceful Dream: The Rise And Fall Of The Indus Civilization by archaeologist and prehistory expert Jane McIntosh is an amazing account of the second oldest known civilization next to the Mesopotamian Civilization. Little is known for absolute certain, yet much has been unearthed of the Indus Civilization. This informative account is gloriously illustrated with maps and black-and-white photographs, as well as a section of color plates, showing the lost treasures and artifacts of an ancient world. Chapters recount and hypothesize about religion, trade, the enigmatic script and the eternal legacy of the Indus Civilization. A Peaceful Dream is a fascinating and ""reader friendly"" historical study which is very highly recommended for personal, school, and community library antiquities collections and reading lists."
positive,"A great read: If you're a single guy and want tips on how to better your mingling capability, this is great. It has a lot of really helpful tips. It for the guy is is already suave and successful with women but also the guy who can't even talk to a girl. It shows you how to either just get sex for the fun of it or how to go after a full fledged, long term relationship, and helps you decide what you are really wanting."
negative,"LegionnAire: LegionnAire is really good but there is to much acting in it, it has really good action. Van Damme should stick with doing Katate movies not acting movies"
negative,"Can we give something zero stars?: Didn't anyone have the courage to tell the puzzlingly popular Jennifer Love Hewitt that she was just wrong for this role? By the way, Audrey Hepburn's career did not end after Breakfast At Tiffany's. Zero stars! ZERO!"
negative,"Not what I remembered as a kid...: This is a review for the ORIGINAL release of the book, not the reprinting...A majority of the writing seemed to be written by a child. Some stories aren't finished - on purpose - but its annoying, others are just down right silly. But then there are a couple ""classic"" stories, like famous urban legends that make up for some of those bad stories. In the end I'm disappointed in this book. I have such fond memories of it from my childhood, it's a shame I don't feel the same way about it anymore.For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile"
positive,So Far So Good: This sweeper is pretty good! It does at times spit stuff out but definitly not as much as other vacuums. It doesnt do it every time and overall i'd recommend this to anyone.
negative,"Very Disappointed: I am very disappointed because unlike the computer game, you can not have kids. They don't grow old and ect.. This game was very disappointing. I wish I could get my money back and just play the computer Sims 2. The computer version is much better!"
positive,"Good work.: Not sure if I can pigenhole this. A little rock, a little blues, maybe a little folk. It is reminiscent of Jeff Buckley. Cornell still knows how to write a gripping chorus. Even if some of the lyrics don't make sense, Cornell sings them so well, you can feel what he's saying. Standouts include the title track and ""Wave Goodbye."" My only gripe is that there is little variation in mood."
negative,"THIS IS WHY AMAZON SHOULD HAVE A 0 STAR RATING: Horrible movie about a stupid company called Silver Shamrock that likes to kill kids using a dumb chip in maskes derived from stone. The acting is horrid and John Carpenter even laughed during an interview and said originally Halloween was going to have different little sub-plots,so basically this movie was going to be recalled since Michael Myers became the main focus of the series. The is one scene where a guy has sex with a women and at the end she is really a robot,which makes absolutely no sense at all. The movie is just a disaster from start to finish,other scenes come to mind like the stupid scenes where a horde of bugs come out of this boys mask and snake later appears out of nowhere. SKIP THIS DVD AT ALL COSTS,I WOULD RATHER WATCH PAINT DRY THEN TO SIT THROUGH THIS [crummy] MOVIE EVER AGAIN"
negative,where my copy: Cant rate something that I have yet to get a copy of. I feel like I calomst could have done better by going to the store and buying it. I have yet to get my first copy of the magazine
positive,"O'Brian...the master.: Anything written by Patrick O'Brian is wonderful, and Treason's Harbor has some of the funniest and most exciting scenes in any novel in the series."
negative,"Bones: This product does suck you in Great !! But the bones in here tore back back up, I had all kinds of bruising when I took this off after wearing it all day, they need to make one smooth with out the bones."
positive,Attention Doulas! Great as a birthing ball!!: As a Birth Doula I purchased this ball to test it out before I reccommended it to my clients to use as a birth ball. It was easy to blow up with the hand pump provided; it only took about 20 minutes (following the overnight directions) your arms get a bit of a workout! I have had friends and family using it and not being exactly gentle! It has held up well. I reccommend following the height guidelines when you purchase your ball. I have all three sizes and they really are for the heights they reccommend. I think this is a good product if your looking for an exercise ball or a birth ball.
negative,"What are we rating here? The book, or ourselves?: I happen to think this is an awful book. Zorba is irritatingly larger than life, yet one-dimensional. The narrator is shallow and immature. I did not think the structure and writing to be very good either.However, looking at some of the reviews, many higher ratings went coincided with admiration of a zest for life, unbound enthusiasm, empathy for indulgence in food, music and sex, and a readiness to forgive blatant sexism, quasi-philosophy, and Taliban-style clan justice. Lower ratings were not as easy to connect, but many less positive reviewers had a more jaded look on life, did not suffer fools gladly, and would not spend a lot of time with either Zorba, the narrator, or the murderers of a suspect widow.In the interest of disclosure, I am a 62 year old hetero European male, and I would find spending time with the narrator cruel and unusual punishment, but I could possibly get to like Zorba, on condition he'd shut up, and play the santuri."
positive,"I wonder what wine goes with that?: Like many other reviewers, I couldn't put this one down. This is a gripping tale of survival in the face of terrible circumstances, and also an interesting history lesson on the whaling port of Nantucket. I really felt sorry for the crew lost at sea in those tiny boats, dealing eventually with cannabalism, the very fate they sought to avoid by the Captain's poor navigational decision. As moved as I was by this particular crew's fate, I was even more moved by Philbrick's description of life on a whaling ship. How miserable! And doing that for two years at a time for miserable wages!! When I think my job sucks, I think of those poor sailors trying out a whale on the deck of that small ship in the dark, and I immediately feel better."
negative,"Spare Animation, too many pop ballads...: A delicate white unicorn (voiced by Mia Farrow) who believes herself to be the last of her kind sets out on a search for other mythological creatures. Along the trek she meets a bumbling wizard named Schmendrick (Alan Arkin) who accidentally transforms her from equine to human. She finds herself on the, er, horn of a dilemma. Somewhere between Mommy Fortuna's (Angela Lansbury) traveling curiosity show and the castle of the evil King Haggard (Christopher Lee), the unicorn meets Prince Lir (Jeff Bridges) and has to decide whether or not to tell him the truth about herself. Based on the novel by Peter S. Beagle, music by soft-pop group ""America"". A great sotry that doesn't quite work in this awkard animation style -- I'm curious to see how the live action version (currently in production) will fare.Staci Layne Wilson"
positive,"Absorbing, biographical account.: I seem to remember Arthur Miller dismissing the notion that this Book is biographical, but it certainly reads that way....One can not help but draw comparison to marilyn monroe fromthe maggie character...in a most unfavorable way.The main character's relationship with the various characters in this book reveal Arthur Millers feelings about his own Life...it's almost like a comment on his marriage to the movie legend and an explanation what happened to her.As a Marilyn fan i find this to be an interesting read and a glimpse into Arthur Miller's side of it all."
negative,read the fine print....: Afraid that the copy I purchased wouldn't play- must have been some small print somewhere that was missed as the copy is in Hebrew and Greek =( =( =( buyer beware
positive,"Extra help: Biotutor might not be the most entertaining software on the planet, but it certainly gives extra curriculum for the average student in Biology. Beside, Biotutor has explanations and notes, which can be useful if you miss a class or are too lazy too take notes. It has plenty of extra exercises that will help you be successful in Bio. The tutor softwares are actually the best review for the SAT II exams in biology, chemistry, and physics. So you might as well take this in consideration before you judge this program.Alex."
negative,"Below average crime drama from the mid 50s: Length:: 4:48 MinsGood photography, but there are so many better crime films from the 50s. Here's a sample...- ""The Asphalt Jungle"" - Directed by John Huston and starring Sterling Hayden- ""No Way Out"" - Richard Widmark and Linda Darnell- ""The Big Heat"" - Fritz Lang directs Glen Ford and Gloria Grahame- ""The Killing"" - Stanley Kubrick directs Sterling Hayden"
negative,Why so much?: I've heard of this movie and was interested in picking it up. But can one of youmovie nerds explain why the price for this is so high?
negative,"Wasted Money......: Wow, I know that I can be a fool, but I was definately robbed of $16.00, even after reading the front and back of this very deceiving book! I mean, I know that I need help with anger, but this book just seemed to make me ANGRIER! I spent $16.00 on a wanna-be Bible (Something I could have gotten for free at my FORMER Church) and the contents only seemed to anger me more! Not only did half of their text not make sense, their descriptions of anger and recognizing anger only seemed to categorize the entirety of this country! The verbage used and perspective in which this ~story~ is told borderlines an autobiography of a man named ""Tom"". If you like a good bedtime story, like to waste time and money, and do not need real anger management help, then by all means buy this ""novel"". My opinion~ Dont waste your time or money, you already wasted enough reading my review! Kyle...."
negative,"Broke after dozen uses: I used the product about a dozen times, and then it would not work anymore. After contacting customer service, they stated it is because the water was sitting in the reservoir, and the unit was not descaled. I find this difficult to believe since it was used only a dozen times. In addition, our office had a Keurig unit for over 5 years, was used by 15 people every day, the unit was never descaled, and functioned just fine. The office is now on a second unit, has been in use for over a year by over 15 people, has never been descaled, and continues to brew just fine. I think they sold a defective unit, and were more interested in selling a new unit than fixing my personal unit."
positive,"Gory but good: This movie was really touching and hard to stop watching, even with blood flying and heads falling. I understand that the gore is what made the movie real, and what it is, but still! Yuck! Anyway, I was impressed, as usual, with Russell Crowe, and Director Ridley Scott really knew what he was doing. The whole film gets a very recommended review from me, just make sure you have a tough stomach. I watched this movie for the first time in Latin class, ... . ... The second time I saw it, it didn't seem nearly as bad and I really enjoyed the true message and meaning."
negative,"So far the word is ""tedious"": I must admit I've never reviewed a book mid-way before. I just had to pause and relate my experience with this for a moment. I'm finding it quite tedious. Perhaps it's simply over my head, as a wholly American girl, but a lot of the themes and references are British through and through. The same sense of dry humor and caustic wit that is typical of English theater is clearly evident here. There is no doubt that it is well written, but I simply haven't yet fallen in love with the characters. Nor have I any idea what the plot actually IS yet. In the first few chapters, we are treated with an explicit gay sex scene. If this is not your cup of tea, then definitely don't buy this book. Oddly, I found this part to be interesting... maybe it's because it's a world with which I am decidedly unfamiliar. I plan to wade through the rest of it, and I hope that it picks up. I'll update my review at that time."
negative,"The biggest pack of lies I've ever read: As one of the 6,000 people who lost their job thanks to this man I had to waste the money to read his side. I was one of many people who were working around the clock for forty five days unraveling what he did. It made everyone sick when we were told how much he actually lost. He has failed to give the entire story and left out many, many key facts. I'm so sorry I gave him my money to read this piece of garbage. What a waste of my time and money and my JOB."
positive,"The Hearth and the Salamander: A future in which books are burnt, teenagers are violent, and free thinking has been destroyed. The few free thinkers that are left are killed, and yet, one man saves a book and reads it, making him a wanted criminal. Guy Montag, the hero, is this man, the rebel, the fireman whose job it is to burn books. This is a classic about censorship, that is now more important than before. Be sure to read this one, along with Orwell's 1984, and you'll get a clear view on what the future can be. And remember, at 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which books burn."
negative,"Disappointing Camera Case: The above item came up when I was ordering my HC96 Sony Camcorder suggesting this was the case for that camera, so I ordered it.When I received it I used it for my new camera on the initial trip. The second day the buckle broke and I almost lost my camera. After returning I find out this was the wrong case for my new camera. It now has been returned.I don't understand why this was included with the camera online.I'm disappointed, plus I couldn't find a bag on you website that would work, so I ordered elsewhere.Ray"
positive,"These still work great-no need for 5 blades that I see: These still work great-no need for 5 blades that I see. I use these with the newer vibrating handle, they give a nice close shave and cost much less that the newer ones..."
negative,"Wrong Version of The Year Without a Santa Claus: Deceptive advertising. Certainly NOT a Christmas Classic. Disk 2 was supposed to be the stop action version of The Year Without a Santa Claus. The characters are all over the cover. I would not buy it, I am returning my copy.Shame on you Amazon for not pulling the product or placing a BIG disclaimer."
positive,Another great book by Max: Max Lucado is awesome! He explains the Word of God in such a way that it can't be misunderstood. This book is no exception.
positive,Fantastic if you can't make a live childbirth class: We had signed up for a live childbirth class but then I was put on bed rest and unable to attend. This DVD was absolutely fantastic for us. It is packed full of useful information and actually quite entertaining. I would highly recommend this DVD as a great alternative to a live class.
positive,"Angel?: Gillain, a shy girl, is rescued from near death by an angel.The Angel helps Gillain get things she never had, like poularityand the attention from a guy she likes, whose name is David (which has a girlfriend). Angel tells Gillain to hurt people to get what she wants. it gets to the point where Gillain can't take it anymore and she wants him to go away. Gillain gets into alot of trouble with Angel and doesn't know how to make him go away. So what Gillain does is she...*Want to know the rest, read the book and you'll find out*I'ts a really good book!"
negative,"Worst buy ever from Amazon: I bought this vaccum after reading many 5 star reviews on Amazon. However, I am totally disappointed in quality & functionality of this vacuum. Within 3 months, this vacuum started falling apart. First, bin cover broke, followed by other parts. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this piece of junk."
negative,"Unreal...: I like Sci-Fi books, and tried something new...the classic, The Count of Monte Cristo. Needless to say, it's not much more believable, the odds of colonizing Mars are better than these events."
negative,"I Wish I Could Give Zero Stars: This is by far the worst of all the Transformer movies. Every scene with Shia and his blowup girlfriend is a slap in the face to modern women. After watching for thirty minutes, I realized I had wasted enough of my time and stopped the film. If I had paid for this, I would have thrown a temper tantrum until I got a full refund."
positive,Love It!: I have loved this book since I first read it in high school. It is fun to revisit it every so many years. I highly recommend it.
negative,"Maybe I would Have Liked it better if I was a ""dummie"": As a practising astrologer, I try to read as many books on astrology as well as how to books for the subject, so that I may learn new techniques with which to teach people who are not yet familiar. I found this book to be condesending to the reader, though perhaps the author meant this to be comical. I did not find the humour and felt as though he was attempting to talk down to the reader rather than simplify astrology. Overall this is an extremely generalized book and not very helpful for anyone who really wants to seriously study astrology. I did not even feel that this would make a good reference book."
negative,"Bring back the Peaceful Planet Aquarium!: We bought this for our infant daughter as a replacement for my older son's Peaceful Planet Aquarium. At first, I was pleased by this product's design and the addition of toys for the child. However, when we began using it, we HATED it! First of all, as others have noted, the motor is excrutiatingly loud to the point that it drowns out the soothing sounds. Second, the lights are too bright for use in a dark room when trying to soothe (not shock) delicate little eyes. Finally, the music on this product is too radio-like, not like the tinkling little lullablies found on its predecessor. After using it for two nights, I put it back in the box and returned it to the store. This toy would fall under the old adage...if it isn't broken, don't fix it! Fisher Price really goofed on this ""improvement."""
negative,"Roth's is the only decent performance: The description for this movie is grossly misleading. The abusive husband was more like a tortured husband whom the wife could not help nor understand and was led to alcoholism and self destruction. The only decent performance is Tim Roth's who only seems to be in the movie for about 5-10min. There is very little suspense, or horror beyond a few weird phone calls and a wife with a guilty conscience seeing her dead husband. Worth seeing if you are a Roth fan but I wouldn't waste too much time otherwise."
positive,A Clockwork Orange: The story is ULTRA-VIOLENT and in Singapore its very hard to get the story A Clockwork Orange.
positive,Carbon Monoxide Alarm: I feel that these are a necessity especially if you live in colder winter climates where you may have the windows closed for a few months.I prefer this model as it plugs in to an outlet rather than battery operated units.I found the models through Amazaon were several dollars cheaper than stores around my area.
positive,"This guy measures up!: I bought this CD for my 12yr old daughter who is a big fan of Clay Aiken, and I have to say that I'm hooked as well! How refreshing it is to hear a performer that isn't a pig..., foul,violent, druggie or has sold out to the recording mecca's! Easily the best new artist I have heard in years,Clay's ""Measure Of A Man"" delivers and you won't be dissapointed. I personally have listened to the CD a dozen times, and ALL the songs are well done.I honestly like all the songs,[many give me chills with that voice] and feel many of the cuts could be big hits. This CD is probably destined for greatness. I will buy this guys stuff from now on, he is an impressive young man on and off the stage, and I'm pround to say he's a good example for young people today..."
negative,"Deadly boring: This book is supposed to be the most sold science fiction novel in the world. It's beyond my comprehension. I loved the computer game and the movie was OK, but in spite of several frantic attempts I couldn't force myself to finish the book. There's simply nothing going on in it!"
negative,Gardening lawn book: Four pages of the book was missing. It just happened to be the formulas that my husband needed. Fortunately he was able to copy our friends book. But I will hesitate to buy another book like this again.
negative,"Bad movie, and a bad DVD as well!: The movie was so-so. Action-wise, it was nice. The acting is horrible though.I was even more disappointed when I popped the DVD into my DVD-ROM on my PC and PowerDVD wouldn't play it. Nor would Windows Media Player 8.0. They used some idiotic video encoding that the computer doesn't like. Thumbs down on that one."
positive,"So EYE opening that I bought every book in the series!: She did such a wonderful job on this book that I had to buy all the other books in this series!! I am a faithful Lynn Austin fan, and I was just so glad to hear how his life could have been like. I usually don't wonder about the lives of people in the bible, but they were just like us with everyday issues. Keep writing Mrs. Lynn, I soooo appreciate you books!Lisa C."
negative,"Not even close, Microsoft.: Trust me, this book isn't even close to covering the exam questions. Don't trust me? Take Microsoft's practive exams and see for yourself how this book fails to even answer those!If you bought this book already, call MSPress and demand your money back. This has to be one of the worst study guides ever written. I also feel sorry for all the MCTs who teach the official ATEC course, since the material in this book is idential to the class material."
negative,"It was an attempt...at most: Ok I have read the book several times, and enjoy it. Tolkien is great. This movie is not. The plot jumps from adventure to adventure giving no time at all for anything to be enjoyed. What is with the American voices! Gandalf isn't from Alabama! The soundtrack is alright. But I can't believe that they put in that song where the goblins are chasing them with that awful 70's rock drum beat. This movie is only worth it for little kids."
positive,"A funny, perky comedy: I find this movie to be very funny and lighthearted. Simply put its entertaining and thats what a comedy should be."
negative,worthless: I bought this for my daughter to sleep on when she was home from college. She actually liked sleeping on it but 3 weeks later it developed a slow leak which I could not find. Therefore I had to throw it away. A complete waste of money.
negative,"Misleading.: Clearly, the producers of this DVD meant to mislead. The cover of the DVD shows the original album cover suggesting that it is a visual equivalent of the album. Please read the cover carefully. It is a quickly put together documentary of the times surrounding the making of the album. Too much time is taken up showning closeups of the of photographic stills that are already on the original album cover and liners.Much time is spent describing the breakup of the relationships.Some of the new performances of the classic songs are again, quickly put together and doesn't provide additional insights.Hastily produced DVD with a misleading cover to cash in on unsuspecting fans."
negative,"One chronic problem that will drive you nuts: When the Keurig machine functions properly, it's a great machine. I own three of them, but I'm replacing them with the Breville unit. The problem is that the Keurig machines constantly, and I mean constantly, go out of prime. That means you'll put in your k-cup, press the button and ... it sits there. Nothing happens. Or you'll select a cup size and a fraction of that amount will dispense. Workarounds include turning the machine on and off, lifting the handle up and back down, lifting off the water reservoir and putting it back on. As I said, I own three of the machines and all of them manifest the same problem. The workarounds usually eventually work, but at this price one would expect a more stable functioning machine. I have had no such problems with the Breville, not once."
negative,"Finnegan's Wake: Stream-of-conscious blather that only a psuedo-intellectual could appreciate. I can't imagine being the person who had to proof-read this drivel, I would sooner plunge my hand into a vat of boiling oil. If it were possible I would give this book zero stars. You'd be better off spending your money on some LSD and interpreting the meaning of the waves in your fingerprints."
positive,"Khristian's Review: My son loves to push this around, he enjoys the music and has learned how to push the nose on the front to make it play music."
positive,"An intense and powerful Drama!: I purchased this movie because I am a huge Brendan Fraser fan, but the movie is so moving that I somewhat forgot that Brendan was in it and became so captivated in the story, that I ended up watching it again a second time. It is wonderfully acted! I think it's Brendan's best work ever and Ian Mckellen is outstanding in this movie. For anyone looking for a movie that will move you and having you wanting friends and family to see it, this one will. It's such a powerful drama. One that I will watch over and over. I'm glad to have it in my Collection."
negative,"bad printer: It does nice job of printing after you fight to get it to pick up paper, or it jams. Did the call HP right after buying it and they were really no help, clean rollors or some other thing you should not do with a new printer. bought there best brand of HP paper, that did not help.So I give up and will call this a total waste of money and am looking to buy a different printer, also This is just me but trying to get the drivers installed was a big pain."
positive,dirtydancing: this movie was the best i've seen it about thirty times and i never get tired of watching it.
negative,"Not exactly a children's film: I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 5 years old. I am 21 now, and seeing this movie even today makes me feel great anxiety. I think this film may be a little too frightening for young children--after all, some scary creature is trying to kill our heroes at every turn. I would hate for any young child to believe any world, even a mythical one, could ever be as scary as Bilbo's! While I believe this is a good video for older children, instead I recommend they read the book when they are a little older."
negative,"Boring and pretentious: I know for a fact that this joker was indeed incompetent, and arrogant as well. it is too bad this clown tries to drag down others when he should slink away and crawl under the rock that he came from."
positive,"GREAT GIFT: Bought this for my grandson , I started a collection of Disney Classic films for him , He and his parents LOVE them and thank me all the time each and every time one arrives"
positive,"A fun introduction to Hardy: This is Hardy's third novel (1873), and is set in the southwest area of England (Cornwall), where he met his first wife. It is the story of young, impetuous Elfride, and her romance with two men: the young architect Stephen Smith and the urbane, educated lawyer, Henry Knight. As common with his other novels, it reflects elements of tragedy, irony, and class advancement. Elfride and Knight are low middle-class persons trying to advance in society and in love. Though not as intricate and challenging as his later novels, it is an entertaining and illuminating read nonetheless."
negative,"Sean McGrath sucks really, really bad...: Why do I even play with this guy? Sean ""Buttbath"" McGrath's guitar playing is a shameful blight within the world of death metal. This record is just the best example of his poor execution of riffing and soloing, and all the metal world suffers for it. Now, if we'd gone with my mix, which was just my excellent bass tracks, my superior low growls, and a snare hit or two, this could've been the record of the year. Thanks, Sean, thanks for ruining my life."
negative,"BEWARE of so-called Novels of Jane Austen (Large Print Edition) -- DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!!: This is not a collection of Jane Austen novels. The first half contains some kind of textbook information on WiMAX technology, and the second half appears to be xeroxed pages of a Sense and Sensibility paperback. I was completely floored. WARNING: I noticed there are several other versions of this book (all entitled ""The Novels of Jane Austen (Large Print Edition)"" with no description given; publisher is BiblioLife)for sale. I'm not sure whether this is some kind of scam or a sneaky way for some dude to get his WiMAX info published?"
negative,"Kindle edition - weak production values: I recently got a Kindle, so I started looking for books to put in to it. Walt Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"" is an old favorite of mine, so I looked for Kindle editions. There were 31 matches to my search, though not all of them are the actual book of poems. My complaints about this offering start with the absence of a table of contents. Whitman didn't title the poems in the original 1855 edition, though he did in subsequent editions, but a table of contents could show the first line of each poem. Beyond the lack of TOC, the edition is not identified nor is the ""publisher,"" which makes it difficult, though not impossible, to associate a rating with a specific offering."
negative,Been there--done that: Not a bit of this book is original. I can't tell you how dissapointed I was to read it after hearing all the hype. It is simply no good. Maybe he'll grow up a bit and the sequel will be better (and not a rip off of every other fantasy novel ever written)
negative,"Good Show, Disappointing DVD Set: I'll save space and say that I agree with the other posts that laud the show for it's quality and usefulness.Unfortunately, the DVD set is seriously flawed. Amazon lists the aspect ration as 1.33:1 and technically that is correct. But, just as the History Channel did with the Dogfight series, the DVDs are actually letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame. Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap direct to video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.If you have an older home theater system, this set being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.Come on, History Channel, move your DVD releases into the 21st Century."
positive,Interesting Enlightenment: It is always a good idea to get enlightened about different subjects. This is a good place to start. The writing was light and entertaining as well as informative. I recommend it!
positive,"Where's your underwear?!!!!!: I have very fond memories of this wonderful DVD set. I really appreciate that the producers put on the DVD season extras, and left the shows 100% complete. No commercial interruptions is such a nice treat. I remember they used to show oodles of commercials between the segments, and cut them up, in syndication.Love it!MC White said: Check it out!"
negative,"Not happy: A flat iron does a better job. This device somewhat straightens, but it's too puffy. You still need to finish the tips with flat iron."
negative,Horton Hatches the Egg: I was very disappointed when I received this book in the mail. It said it was in good shape but when I got the book there were stickers all over the front of the book. I was able to take the stickers off but was still disappointed it said nothing about them being on there when I ordered the book.
negative,"This is Merovingian Nights ,not a new book: mergovian nights was the original series this muddled piece of work is based on. entire chapters and plots are lifted from those books, its unreal.the original books are much better, the loss of Retribution Jones, turning her into a minor wimpy character, was a great loss of a strong voice. i found most of the characters a poor imitation of the original series.having been to venice, i can state this book did not take me there, i had trouble belivieng it was venice, not paris.M lackey has written some fine books, why she put her name on this is a mystery."
positive,"Ex-military man falls for live-in nanny!: Another installment in the Texas Cattleman's Club series - Silhouette Desire #1547 (November 2003) - ""Entangled With A Texan"" by Sara Orwig. Book summary from back cover:Tied up in knots! How on earth had Texas Cattleman's Club member David Sorrenson been roped into protecting a tiny baby girl? The ex-military man knew everything about security and danger, not infants! Marissa Wilder was the perfect solution. This down-to-earth family gal knew all about children, and agreed to be a live-in nanny at his ranch. David yearned to show Marissa a steamy night or two, even though his high-risk lifestyle had taught him to avoid long-term attachments and his sexy houseguest deserved someone permanent. Living with Marissa was tangling up his emotions something awful, and if he didn't know better he'd swear he was falling for her...."
negative,"Not worth the money: My wife tried this product and hated it. It smelled terrible, and did not work. Would never buy it again. Way too much money for something that didn't work."
negative,I don't have answers to your questions: I gave this item as a gift. I don't have answers to your questions. I thought the doll was very expensive. Diane
negative,"A Big Disappointment: The characterization and plot of this story are so different from the first two miniseries that it can hardly be called a sequal! I'm not a purist, but I think that a screenplay should at least be faithful to the spirit and vision of a novel/series, and this one fails miserably. The characters have the same faces, but their personalities have changed. They have been time warped from the late 1800's to 1914, and their behavior is unfaithful to their former portrayals. Take some advice--watch the last scene of ""The Sequal"", sigh happily, and forget you ever heard about this one."
positive,Great nutrition can taste good: As long as you don't mind a little gritty texture there really aren't any issues with this product. I like it fine with water but it tastes pretty good with different juices. I like to drink it in the morning to feel like I'm nourishing my body when I have to wait a while until I get to eat food. I just put a scoop in my blender bottle with slightly watered down juice and I'm good to go first thing in the morning.Good for busy people on the go or anyone that just wants a little boost.When I run out I will repurchase.
positive,very satisfied: The quality of the product was perfect. Brand new. It was sent out it two days. I was very satisfied.
negative,"Don't bother with this one.: Now maybe I'm just dumb, but I found this book incredibly tedious to read. I could live with the vague religion, the convoluted story line, the cheesezy references to ""old earth"", even the dense and overly decriptive paragraphs that yield little in the way of plot or character devlopment. I slogged though all that and at the end of it we find out very little about ""sam"" or what he was doing this whole time except that he is fighting a civil war againist the gods. I could go on and on, but basically don't waste your money on Lord of Light."
positive,"Excellent Fun!: ""Ransom"" is one helluva good read. i was transfixed as i got to know Gillian, her courage & bravery & compassion. and little alec was so much fun, too! brodick is super sexy & not too bossy & has just the right amount of vulnerability to not seem like an overwhelming jerk. :-) if you like adventure & mystery, definitely read this. (though i will say, it seemed like once alec was safe at home, gillian didn't really think all that much about him. from what i discerned of her character, i would have thought she'd be thinking about him more in the story, but he's barely mentioned after he's back w/his parents. and i totally agree with everyone who said that bridgid & ramsey could have had their own book! julie! write another book about those two! they were so much fun!) this book really takes you in & you feel like you know these people. very well written & developed characters. thank you, julie!"
positive,"Beautiful, high quality necklace!: This necklace is absolutely gorgeous! The chain is a nice, thick one, not too small and delicate. The stones are a very clear, vibrant blue. Can't wait to wear it for my wedding!"
positive,"All Time Favorite: I can say this is my all time favorite movie of all times. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again, without getting tired of watching it. I highly recommend this movie to everyone."
positive,"One of Heinlein's better Children's Stories: This book is an excellent adventure in the Heinlein series. He once again creates a captivating set of charecters that drwas the auidence in. The story is set in space, as the main charecter is attempting to become a part of the elite space patrol. It is a story about duty, honor, and becoming a man with responsibility"
negative,"Um...NO.: Ok I hate to burst anyone's bubble about this movie...but it says on the cover ""A better and scarier movie than Hostel"". Um...NO. I actually enjoyed it up to the point where they got into the house and it got dark. From that point on the movie took place in nothing but darkness and you could not tell what was happeneing or who was who. So so annoying. This movie pissed me off. Don't waste your money. Thank god I only paid a few bucks for it. A complete waste of time. Eww."
negative,"This game Pretty much sucks: I was very disappointed with this game. I love the Resident Evil series, but this one sucked. Your AI partners are not very intelligent, they run around and don't listen to you when you need them. Normal mode is actually more like a ""hard"" mode. You can't really pause the game as it is live and the monsters come get you anyway, even when your in your inventory screen. The online option has been disabled so you can't play with other people anymore.It was just a hassle to control three people simultaneously, two of which never listen anyway.The only good thing is the scenery and surroundings. Also I liked how zombies could run after you if they wanted, instead of always dragging themselves around. Other than that, I really did not like this game."
negative,"sparked, then didn't work: We plugged this on only to have it spark and not power our ibook G4. It went back the next day."
positive,Great toy...but....: I think this is great. My son loves to stare at it for time on end but the only downfall is that it only stays on for about five (5) minutes and then turns off.
negative,This is high density module: This is high density module. It works only with a fewmainboards. It does not with the two I have.Amazon.com - please correct me if I am wrong.
positive,"not his best, but pretty good: It's the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be read by every high school student alive. While not hideously exciting to the modern reader, there is a lot to be gleaned from this compassionate narrative about the unhumanness of the modern world."
positive,"An unusual and rewarding historical novel: This is the story of the Great Trek told from the viewpoints of the Afrikaner trekkers and the Africans they ended up subjugating. Abrahams, who I believe was coloured under the old apartheid classification, is an extraordinarily empathetic writer, not a political polemicist. His brand of empathy is at the root of South Africa's successful transition to democracy."
negative,"But the aliens are cool: I'm judging this book having read it once, waited a year, and then read it again, and this book did not survive the journey well.Every plot twist was predicted, every villain was a stereotype, everything, everything in this book could be seen in advance or simply mirrored some other book or story, and served only as a pale imitation of the sources it copied. The only good thing in this book were the aliens. Sorry, better luck next time."
negative,"Poor chapter indexing: I bought this DVD because, many years ago, I worked on this film. Because I use it to teach a class, I have had the VHS version for many years. I thought that I would get into the 21st century and buy the DVD, in hopes that I could access the scenes I needed for the class quicker. Because the chapter index is very skimpy, I have to use a combination of the DVD an the VHS tape for the class. It sure beats winding and rewinding to get to the scenes I need but it sure would've been nice to have a bigger index. P.S. - yes, it's an awful movie but I didn't write it or act in it but it paid my rent."
positive,"As touching as it is wacky....: Horton remarks: ""An elephant's faithful - 100 percent!"" as he struggles to keep his word by protecting a lazy bird's egg. It teaches the important lesson of standing on principle, in spite of the hardships one might encounter along the way. Of course it comes across as fun, never preachy. This book actually brings tears to my eyes, even though it is so zany!"
negative,"WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!: this movie is TOTALLY OFF! and it skips a huge amount of time. the great world war (WWI) doesn't take place until Anne's kids are old enough to fight in tha war and get married. not when she and Gilbert are. so this story has nothing to do with that of ANNE OF GREEN GABLES. if you've never read teh books, it's a pretty good story. b ut if you have, don't bother. i wont even let anyone in my family buy it for me even though they know it will complete my set. don't bother with it if you are a true L.M. Montgomery fan."
positive,"melancholic and upbeat: This is one of my favorite Guy Clark efforts. I love the marvellous mixture of the melancholic and the upbeat. Some highlights for me are the elegaic wistfulness of songs like Fort Worth Blues and Forever, for Always, for Certain. These lovely songs are nicely balanced by the energy displayed in such tunes as Sis Draper or Die Tryin'.For me Guy Clark belong to that select band of singer/songwriters which include such luminaries as John Prine and Kris Kristofferson"
negative,totally junk !!!!`: wireless doesnt work and ethernet still doesn't workwasted an hour ... I have tried another $99 similar product from huggcences which works great except it's wired no wireless
negative,"Sorry Iggy: Sometimes Iggy gets lazy and this is one of those times. Sounds like he read from his diary and then the record company, in desperation, found someone to back him up. The cover of the Pirates' ""Shakin' All Over"" is classic. I don't have the import version listed here with the live Paris shows. But remember, Parisians love Jerry Lewis too!"
positive,"Very Complete: I bought this dvd for my husband for Christmas. He was thrilled, as we have talked about taking a class for a long time and we were house-bound with a storm. The only criticism that I MIGHT have is that it is so comprehensive that it is a little overwhelming for a beginner. You really have to dedicate yourself to it to use it. No haphazard attempts at learning."
positive,"Outstanding!: I saw this in the Astrology Shop in London, after perusing about a half dozen other synastry titles and indeed, the shop owners highly recommended this over any other one. This one clearly stood out. It is an awesome read. Pick this one up. It's so in depth and accurate. Stephen is an excellent writer."
positive,american graffiti/more american graffiti: good but the rating needed to be rated R or rated pg-13 at less. Parts of it are not for young kids or teens.
positive,"The Vedic Path: This gorgeous set--consisting of CD, DVD, and map--is well worth the investment. My friend, whose birthday present it was, was enchanted, and used it for meditation, excercise, and to create a peaceful ambience for writing. The vocals are evocative and ethereal without being repetitive or simplistic. I would recommend."
positive,Absolute Must Have: I had no idea I would need this so much. It wasn't even on my registry but someone gave this to me at my baby shower and now I can't imagine life without it. We started using it when my son was around 2 months old and began sleeping in his crib. We use it at bedtime and at nap time and it always puts him to sleep. He loves to watch the bubbles and the fish all lit up. He zones right out to fall asleep. Every baby needs this item in their crib!
negative,"Not a good bedside telephone!: The editiorial review claims that this is a great bedside table, but it fails to tell you that the clock and all of the other parts of the unit are not lighted! Needless to say, what is the point of an alarm clock if you cannot see it at night! I will be returning this item immeditately!!"
negative,"KAY ARE A PEE: Um, hello? Has anyone noticed that this woman doesn't know how to sing? Most songs are an over-baked litany of melodramatic metaphors that add up to ... what? Others appear to be some sort of short story told in the past tense. All are whisper-talked by the artist in her faux Gallic/Brit accent that wears poorly as the CD progresses. The few times when the producers require her to actually hit a note are cringe-inducing.I wanted to like this record and spent $15 of hard-earned cash on it. But I guess there's a good reason why she's only dragged out of storage every ten years."
positive,"A Bostonian in Minnesota reviews Meir Zarchi's ""I Spit"": Meir Zarchi's classic ""I Spit on your Grave"" is an assault on your senses. It graphically depicts the most vile acts known to man: rape and murder. It is quite a strong pro-capital punishment document. It is a story of rape and revenge, that makes you feel totally uneasy. It is not your average horror movie. It doesn't offer many jump out of your seat, visceral scares...it just plain out disturbs you. If you like this one...check out Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left"" (1972)"
negative,"Weak Plot Hurts Mayan Novel: Heart of a Jaguar is well written with reasonably good descriptions, but does not have a good plot. On the back of the book, it talks about how the city is having a bad drought and they try sacrificing a dog, but it doesn't bring rain, and will they ask Balam to make the greatest sacrifice of all? When I read this it told me exactly what would happen in the end, but I won't give it away. None of the stuff on the back of the book happened until some time near the end. Random events occured up to the ceremony that weren't that important to the story. This book is accurate with what the Mayan culture was like, but has a very bad plot. Also, this book gets very descriptive with the bloody descriptions when it is not incredibly important. Overall, I didn't really like this book"
negative,"Beware of Kaplan books and courses (spread the word): Due to my position (Human Resources Director) in an American multinational company located in Bogota, Colombia, and having studied English in the United Kingdom, I decided it was time to study for an MBA in order to further my career. I needed 250 on the CBT Toefl. I was advised to attend the best and most expensive prep center, Kaplan Bogota, so I did. I took the TOEFL twice. The first time I scored 207 and the second time 190, very far from the score I needed for my MBA. Seriously, I don't know how could somebody claim to have scored 290 with Kaplan preparation, and even less with this Kaplan TOEFL book that I recently disposed in the garbage. Moreover checking the ETS's statistics for the last 3 years and the standard deviation for Toefl scores, no one has scored above 287. Therefore I find very dubious some reports stated herein. Use common sense and never enroll in a Kaplan course."
negative,Not for this century!: After reviewing the encouraging reviews I decided to buy the movie and see it for the first time. To tell you the truth I was not impressed at all. This movie might have been something extra ordinary back in the 80s but if you see it now for the first time you'll be very much disappointed!
negative,"Irrelevant for some state & women: I found this book almost entirely irrelevant and in sore need of update. Nowadays, many states have ""no fault"" divorce (e.g., Colorado), the men's movement has changed culture, and MANY women are career women who are the main bread-winners of the family. This book takes NONE of that effectively into account. Therefore, the book was a total waste of money and time for me. I do not recommend it for any career woman and dedicated mother who is the bread-winner and in a position to need to pay maintenance, lose significant assets, AND lose parenting time despite being BOTH primary parent and primary breadwinner. This book needs to catch up with the times."
negative,"No plot, No Characters: One of the worst novels I have ever read. Well researched - maybe, poorly written - definately. The plot simply goes nowhere, and the characters are so unrealistic and banal that it is impossible to feel sympathetic toward them. Why the author felt she had to abandon any attempt at subtlety, and write as if the readers were as ignorant as her characters seem to be is beyond me."
negative,"Where's the Plot?: After hearing all the hype about Gladiator, I was dissappointed to see it for myself ( DVD version ). I was told that the fight scenes were good, and they were, but the rest of the movie is just filler. There is almost no plot whatsoever, and what little there is is so incredibly predictable it's almost sad. The best part of the 2 disc DVD set is the real history of the gladitorial games on the second disc. Give this one a miss."
negative,"Nothing but fluff: I have a hard time understanding why there are so many positive reviews here. This book is nothing but fluff. If you are anything more than a newbie, it's got nothing and if you're a complete newbie there's just enough information to be dangerous. She promises periodically that more information will be given about actually growing certain plants, but that information is never forthcoming.It's full of personal anectdotes that have little to do with the topic at hand, the tone is condescending and she encourages the use of poisons. She anthropomorphizes plants in an embarrassing way, telling a story about a poisonous plant she accidentally purchased as if it had a personal vendetta against her and her family. Her attitude toward plants goes beyond respect into something slightly off-kilter.The book is good for a giggle. If you must read it, make sure you have a firm grasp of both gardening and herbal magic first. Otherwise you could well follow this lady into lala land."
negative,"Sad: Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite Authors. This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up. Some of the characters you never figure out why they are in the novel at all.It's too bad that I spent money on this book when I could have purchased a Mercedes Lackey Novel without help."
positive,"Clancy's Second Best: I've read the majority of Clancy's books in the past year and i find him great one of the best authors. Up there with Dean Koontz, Stephen King, Robert Magammon and Micheal Chricton. Now the best book madeby Tom was Rainbow Six and this came in a close second place. I had buht the book and then idn't expect that it would be that great because it's basd on WW3 and its 725 pg's long so i didn't ed it for the longest time. That was my mistake i should have read it right away. It took me under a week to read it was so good. He describes the war so well and the battle seens he wrote it was like i was there. He made the war even and not lop-sided (like he did in SSN) he made both sides win the battles. For some reason though i wanted the Russians to in this book i guess i'm just sick of always seeing the Yankee's win (there so full of themselves when it comes to war movies or books. They think there the best). Any way this is a must read for everyone unless you hate war."
negative,"Bites: I hated this book. William Faulkner has to be the poorest excuse for a writer that ever lived. I got so tired of his pages long sentences and parentheticals within parentheticals within sentences within parentheticals (I wish I were making this up). To make matters worse, sometimes his parentheticals were so long, I forgot what preceded it! And let's not forget his made-up words (uninsatiable? ever hear of a dictionary, Will? IT'S NOT IN THERE!) This book bites, HARD. And let's face it, if he were alive today, no way would anyone with a brain publish this garbage. At least not without some serious editing."
negative,"Do not bother: This book is just tripe to feed off the the ""vampire community."" Virtually all of the Egyptian references have been culled from the Temple of Set's Order of the Vampyre which predates this book and the ""vampire community."" If you really want to learn about vampires I suggest you look into the Temple of Set's Order of the Vampyre instead of white washed right hand path material such as this."
positive,"Solid Intro Read into Subject: Being a senior in high school, I was looking for a quick read to give me some insight into Indian cultures pre-Colombian Americas for a research paper. I was intensely interested in the book and the overall themes were hit with large amounts of info and sources. The only major complaint I have is the way he structured the book. He jumps around time periods and at some points it was confusing if you didn't have prior info on the subject when events were happening. Besides that it was a solid book that satisfied my need."
positive,Stable and lightweight: This is a fantastic running shoe for the pronator. It is stable and I don't have to wear my orthotics when I run in them. I am a medium mileage runner and weigh 155lbs.
positive,"Pampers Baby Dry: Love love them,my son goes 6hrs especially at night without a leak.These pampers are economical as he started using a size 3 at 5&1/2months and is now going to 9months yet he has not outgrown them.Would recommend highly."
positive,"It is a classic for a reason.: The imagery in this book is haunting and evocative. The struggle for dignity amid poverty is still poignant and relevant today. This book is a timeless classic. Read it for the first time, or read it again. You will be glad that you did."
negative,Vacuous Tripe: Worse even than the nonsense Brokow prattles on the television. Unconscionable slop served up to a generation who should have the wits to know when they're being pandered to.
positive,"Persuasion is to Literature as Mozart is to Music: Other than to die hard Austen fans, this ""other"" perfect writing may be somewhat unknown. It should not be. If a person believes himself or herself to be a well-rounded reader, but does not insist upon reading every major work of Austen's, they deceive themselves.I thought I had an adequate idea of Austen's works by watching the films ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"". I decided to read these two books, simply out of curiosity as to how they would stand against the films. I found the movies to be lacking the absolute finest portions of each story, so I decided to read Austen's other works that I had not been familiar with.Persuasion, as well as everything I have read from the pen of Jane Austen, does not disappoint. Well, except that it does, eventually, end. It's worthy of as many accolades as her more famous works, and as the others do, causes a sense of general happiness in its reader."
positive,Cool applications!: My girlfriend mixed this uranium ore in with her nail polish and now I can see her fingernails in the dark!
negative,"One dimentional plot and characters despite special effects: This movie follows the footsteps of movies such as ""Twister"" and ""Juracic Park"" - rich in effects and no substance. Come on, formula such as ""a girl screw up a spell requiring a handsome guy to rescue her"" is overused. Of course at the end the treasures are lost. Despite some fun moments, this is a one-time rental."
positive,"Dog loves them & they're easy to break apart!: My puppy absolutely loves the Puppy treats. The treats themselves are easy to break into smaller pieces, and I can get away with using one or two for a 10min training session because the puppy is happy with very small bits of these treats. They also are more natural & low-fat than many other treats I've looked at. My only hold back is the price; I had gotten these on clearance for $2 a bag at Petco, but I now can't seem to find them anywhere else in stores."
positive,"Excellent: I've never understood the negativity associated with this album. Paul sings his guts out, the songs are good and rock very well indeed."
negative,They could have made it good!: I dont even feel like watching it again and seeing if I liked it the second time around. It was very hard for me not to turn it off the first time. I dont look forward to buying the DVD. In fact make it Zero Stars.
positive,"First slip ever, and does its job perfect: Honestly, my biggest beef with this slip is that the white looks too white. I would've liked the nude color in my size and short enough I can wear with the dresses I need this for, otherwise, does exactly what I needed."
positive,"A Fun Read!: A quick, light-hearted read that kept my attention from beginning to end. Not the kind of book I usually read, although I'm glad I took the time to give this one a whirl. Definitely good for a few chuckles."
negative,"r u all kidding? this album sucks horribly...: yet even some of you who agree that the album bites still say that ""tub thumping"" is okay, even if it ""gets old after awhile"". that song is CRAP!!! has to be one of the worst songs ever to get play. EVER! sounds like a bad radio commercial for some english beer they're trying to market in the states.that song (if you can call a random string of cheesy choruses a song) makes the strongest argument AGAINST ANARCHY that i've ever heard. proves that people who can't agree on anything can't make a song that makes any sense or follows any consistent theme.gotta go - just threw up in my mouth from the bilious memory of this worthless pop drivel."
negative,"Terrible and off-base: This novel is a travesty. That Ms. Barrett would even presume to complete the work of one of the greatest English authors is audacity personified. This book is extremely boring and seemingly plotless. If you're looking for a satisfying completion to this novel choose ""Sandition"" by Jane Austen and ""Another Lady"" instead. Ms. Barrett not only fails to deliver the wittiness and sharp insight of a Jane Austen novel, she also fails miserably at attempting Austen's style of writing. Truly a disappointment, to put it mildly."
positive,"Not like the Movie!: A friend has a bumper sticker; ""Movies are Gooder than books!"" For me, this experienced promotes reading above or at least before film. I've not finished yet but it is like reading a new story with some of the same characters. I often wondered how John Ford was able to fit all the excessive verbiage of ""Moby Dick"" in to a film of normal length. Then upon seeing the credits from the beginning I see Screenplay, John Ford and Ray Bradbury. That explained a lot. I've now come to realize that T V are Gooder than Books!"
negative,"Had a bad reaction to this soap: This soap made me break out in a rash everywhere I used it. I do not have insurance and I thought I would try to get around going to the dermatologist, but in the end it cost me more because I had to go to the doctor for the rash this soap caused and the original problem. It was $96 for an office visit(the dr. actually gave me a discount believe it or not) and I got 3 different kinds of meds that cost me $76 total. Just be careful if you use this stuff. Not sure what I had the reaction to because there's alot of stuff in it."
negative,"Intellectual Pap: Our book club agrees totally with L.A. Readers Anonymous. Terrible. We spent 20 minutes discussing the book before proceeding to more critical life stories. Most of the members were disconcerted with the Chapter 0 pretension. I however, agree with A Reader from Chicago about the Edwin Booth monologue. Did we miss something there? Or was it merely a device to show off a fancy writing style? Nothing came together, we couldn't get the point and most of the other members were FURIOUS about the lack of/misuse of punctuation and the ENDLESS rambling and repetitiveness. National Book Award????"
positive,Excellent: Jimmy Smith cooking at his best. Christmas songs taken to a new level while maintaining the love and sprit they were written for.
negative,Corporate Rock: For about the last 20 years or so it always the same thing when the Stones release a studio album - this time they're serious. Sure.
negative,"People Can't Hear Us!: I have never had more people complain that they cannot hear us than with this phone! The sound quality is horrible. Whenever I call home I have to tell my husband to speak up until he's practically shouting. The same is true for incoming calls. I can't say that I hear static, and I'm not aware of the channels changing. People voices are just muffled, like they're talking through a wall. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the caller ID has some quirks, and doesn't always show a new call. The answering machine also cuts out frequently. There are many features with the caller ID and number storage, but they are not very user friendly. Overall, this is the worst phone I've ever had."
positive,"Great fit, warm, flexible.: I bought this to wear under my helmet while riding my bike in the winter months. It fits great (snug without being tight), is long enough in the neck to tuck into my shirt, and is flexible so that i can easily pull it down under my chin when i didn't want it up over my nose/mouth. The material is nice and soft and relatively thin so it's not at all annoying. Very happy with this purchase."
positive,"Lectures To My Students: I think this book is a requrement for anyone that is in the ministry. I found a lot of nuggets embeded in the book. Principles that the author provide for the reader are applicable to life and other disciplines. If you are seeking to enrich your theology education, I highly recommend this book. Written hundreds of years ago, Spurgeon's ideas and concepts transcends time. This book will be a part of my library for years to come. In fact, I purchased a copy for my brother since he is in the ministry."
positive,Stacey's dad is getting married!: Wedding bells are ringing! Stacey's father is about to take a big step...he's engaged to his girlfriend Samantha. Stacey's thrilled but her mother just doesn't understand. Mrs. McGill isn't happy with the news at all. And her poor daughter is about to try endless efforts into making her mother feel better...even if it means something drastic! Looks like she's going to have to round up her friends and do some serious planning! But do there plans make the situation better or a disater? Uh-oh.
negative,"worst book ever!!!: this book is the worst book i have ever read!!!! i had to read this for school, and it was horrible! the writing is bad and i was falling asleep throughout the plot. this book does not even deserve the one star i am giving it! u seriouly hated this book."
positive,"A great book for readers!: When I first looked at the book, I thought it was one of those long, boring books. I was wrong! It was better than the Harry Potter books I think. It is really interesting! I want to start reading the other books in the series soon. I think the hardest part about reading this book is keeping the names straight. J.R.R. Tolkien must have had a hard time coming up with all these names! There is a lot of fighting in this book. I would suggest this book to readers who like challenging books and for readers who like fantasy and wars. This book is long, but never boring!"
positive,"Thought Provoking...Interesting: This book raises questions of conspiracy with its story of how history is altered according to the times and whims (?) of the few. I recommend this book for anyone studying history, and anyone who wants to know ""the truth."""
positive,"Very Touching Experience: Rush has always been a band near and dear to my heart, but this documentary puts them #1. This film will leave you astonished, touched, and wowed. A perfect year-by-year explanation and description of the band from the beginning. The band's overall good spirits and humor will keep you laughing well after you finish watching. A definite worth-while experience and the extra content adds an extra hour-and-a-half to the film. Overall, this is the best band documentary i've ever seen and it pays tribute to the world's #1 cult band."
negative,"Movie is not the complete original: While this version of ""Midway"" has a lot of extra features, some of the original movie scenes are not there. Even my husband, who's only seen it a couple of times, realized this. I would gladly trade the extras for the entire original movie."
positive,"Great exhaust for the price, fits 1993-2001 Cherokees: This kit actually fits 1993-2001 Jeep Cherokee XJ's, not 93-98 as the description above may say. It's a great basic replacement cat-back kit. It's no Borla, but you're not paying Borla prices either. The only parts that you may need that do not come with the kit are two metric 10mm 1.5 thread pitch bolts - and that is only if you have a 2000-2001 Cherokee. The exhaust sounds great, a little more bass to it, but no drone or rattles. Very easy install, removing the old rusty exhaust is always the hardest part.One other helpful note - if you have to replace any of the exhaust hangers on your Cherokee due to rust (the rear one in particular), they can be hard to find outside of a Jeep dealer. NAPA tends to carry them however."
positive,"Great edition!: Besides the awesome story, specially for those who are LOTR fans, this edition artwork is great! Great item for Tolkien's fans."
positive,"Excellent!: I thought this movie had it all, action, adventure, horror, humor, and romance! The special effects were excellent as well. Move over Arnold, Bruce and Sylvester! Brendan Fraser is the next big screen action hero!"
negative,Her book is as unclear as her speech: The author presents ideas that are outdated and imposible to implement into society. She is obviously an idealogue who is incapable of relating reality to government. She provides simple solutions to difficult problems. It just doesn't connect and her kame logic permeates this book. I would give a lower rating one star but there is no choice.
positive,closest and safest: Very close and safe shave.I still use an electric occasionally but nothing shaved closer than my 5 blade fusion.Usually after shaving with my Braun I have to do a touch up with the fusion to get that smooth feeling
negative,"ok: This costume is very flimsy, but the bright pink color is great. The only problem we had was the elastic on the mask was too short to fit my daughter's head. So I cut it off and used glue dots to glue the mask onto a pair of sunglasses that I pushed the lenses out of. Perfect fit and much easier to wear!"
positive,this CD Rocks! can't wait for the next!: this Cd was recomended to me by my best friend and I will recomend it to anyone else! I can understand why the receivers were voted number one in a bay area servey!
positive,"Works well, almost too well: This little device, is inexpensive and very easy to set up. The only issue I have is that it can be triggered off easy. Our neighbor's cat likes to trigger it off in the driveway, so don't be alarmed if it goes off once. I have learned to wait until it goes off more than once, maybe even a few times, and then you know someone is out there. Little things can trigger it off like small animals and very windy days."
positive,"Best Christmas Movie Ever!: While it doesn't have as big a media exposure as ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" I think in many respects ""The Bishop's Wife"" is better and far more emotionally engaging. The interplay between Cary Grant and Loretta Young is wonderful and David Niven's performance is priceless. This movie will put you in the right spirit, guaranteed!"
negative,"In-line Writing Style: This is the worst programming textbook I have yet seen. It requires the student to read each chapter from start to finish, because one cannot just go to a subject of interest and learn it. The writing style is completely in-line. I found I had to re-read sections many times to ascertain what the authors were trying to say, and the code examples were not self-contained. While I am not a programmer by training, I have taken a course in Java and many other courses. This book also focused too much on databases to my taste, but others may find that emphasis useful. Even the teacher who selected it said he made a mistake."
positive,"This is a deserted island disc.: If I were on a deserted island and could have only one cd and a solar powered cd player, this album would be the one! Lauren Hill's lyrics flow like water and the beats are hypnotic without dulling the senses. Her ability to switch from singing to rhyming is unique and seamless. The woman clearly is about business because she let her album drop with no mistakes in her ""sound"" or style!! I wouldn't be surprised if she stepped out on her own permanently (listen to ""Lost Ones"", and ""Forgive them Father""-- she is TALKING to someone REAL CLOSE to her). This is beyond the limits of ""hip hop"" and 'R & B"", this is soul for the '90s. While KIm, Foxy, Mya and whoever else is out there posin', Ms. Hill is getting the job done!"
positive,"Classic: I originally read this way back in jr. high and sadly only remember being entranced by it--not recalling any of the plot. I finally got around to the rereading and recalled why I had the original feeling of enchantment. This is one good book.Kit Tyler is a sixteen-year-old girl who leaves Barbados after her grandfather's death for the more austere world of Puritan New England to say with her aunt's family. But Kit is completely unprepared for the ways of these people. Even so, she manages to grow in unimaginable ways as she connects with people with whom she would have never seen herself.And it's not a simple moralistic book. It's a book about a girl coming of age. Unlike other books of the Puritans, there are no villains, just those who are different and it's amazing to see Kit come to understand that.The characters are entrancing and dimensional, the setting is described in an honest prose that only shows Speare's love of New England.It deserves its Newberry."
negative,Still Waiting for growth: I ordered 5 bags and spread it all in newly tilled ground. I watered regularly and still not one single blade of grass has grown. Perhaps it grows in Canada but not Washington State!! Would not waste my money again.
positive,"Since By Man: A great album which has strains of At The Drive In and other similar influences. Very diverse, each song being completely different in sound and essence."
positive,Great!!: I really like this blush. Goes on easily-- with a light sweep of the brush. Not much is needed for a shimmery glow!
positive,"Great band!: This is a great CD. I haven't heard progressive rock like this in many years. One thing I really like about the CD is that even though the band members are obviously very talented musicians, they never lose sight of writing good songs and melodies - not self-indulgent. I was very pleasantly surprised, and will have to check out the rest of their CDs now."
negative,"Vastly Overrated...: I have never entered a theater or turned on a video machine intending to hate a Stanley Kubrick film, but invariably that's the reaction I leave with, particularly for this waste of time and film. ""Ultra-Violence?"" I've seen more disturbing scenes in Spider-Man comic books.Since nothing I can write is likely to tarnish the undeserved reputation afforded to this so-called ""classic,"" I'll be brief: ""A Clockwork Orange"". (...)Not to disparage everyone who likes this movie, but this is the sort of pabulum that posers and pseudo intellectuals enjoy pontificating about. Of course, I have noted that the people who are truly passionate this movie tended to have seen it as a teenager, so perhaps there is something about it that resonates within the callow minds of (particularly) young men? I neither know nor care."
positive,"Wonderful feminist novel: This is a great, imaginative book, one of my favorites. I highly recommend it."
positive,"Nagata's best book yet -- 4.5 stars: ____________________________________________I thought Limit of Vision was Nagata's best book yet -- she's gaining full knowledge & control of the novelist's toolkit. And I admire her essential sweetness of vision: that probems have solutions, & that most people, given half a chance, will act decently and kindly.Except the bad guys, of course...Hghly recommended.Oh, and her website is well-worth a visit:http://www.maui.net/~nagataHappy reading--Pete Tillman"
positive,"Algebra: Structure and Method, Book 1: I have been teaching high school mathematics for 43 years and have used this series of textbooks the whole time, it is an outstanding textbook (series), unlike the watered down textbooks now being published. I was able to purchase 20 used textbooks for the price of 2 brand new ones. The books were in the shape stated in the ad and they will replace the books that are falling apart from 10 years of usage."
negative,"Dont waste your time with this book!: This book will tell you that six sigma is an excellent quality improvement program, (You probably heard this already) yet authors won't equip reader with the tools that six sigma offers. I read this book twice with a strong desire to understand the principles of the six sigma, but after reading it cover to cover twice I got nowhere.I like to read, and through the years I read a lot of books, but consider this to be the worst business book I read so far! Jack Welch, in his book Winning (which I strongly recommend) dedicates one short chapter to Six sigma, and it covers everything you will learn from this book. This book offers no substance what's so ever!!"
positive,awsome book: if you are a novice or experianced sailor this book will help you. It was a great read and help for my sailing skills. If you want to learn easy tips for sailing you will find them hear. Also if you are intrested in some just facts of sailing buy this book.
positive,"A Good Book To Read.: The book The Thread That Runs So True by Jesse Stuart was a good book. At the first glance, it looked pretty boring, but after reading it I was glad I did. It is about his life as a teacher at a young age . He teaches students that are older and younger than him. He has a lot of different problems, but in the end he is able to overcome these problems with no problem at all. This book is very interesting and fun to read. It makes you want to read more or never put it down."
negative,"Agree: I agree with other reviewers regarding Jarrett. His noises are irritating and distracting not unlike in his own 1970s live solo effort, ""Koln Concert"". The sound engineers at ECM need to seriously considering editing these grunts and groans when remastering these discs."
negative,"Many Flaws in Mellor's 'Nursery Knits': This book's patterns are seriously flawed. My attempt to follow the ""outdoor snuggly"" for a 0-3 month old baby resulted in a 32 inch waistline snuggly with legs that were too long and arms that were too short. In addition, the photos of the snuggly did not match the pattern's instructions. My cousin used the baby poncho pattern and had a myriad of similar problems. Do NOT buy this book!"
negative,"Straight to the trash can!: Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!"
negative,"No longer has diced pick-n-pluck foam: I have about a dozen of these cases holding various pieces of camera and lighting gear. Nothing too heavy duty, but up until my last order of 2 more cases, they've always come with a thick inner foam panel made of diced pick-n-pluck foam. This made customizing the case interiors easy and very nice to create compartments where I wanted them. The last order came with the same good (cheap) cases and foam, but the 3rd foam panel is UNCUT, UNDICED, and thinner than before. Really frustrated by this change which wasn't documented anywhere before I re-ordered. Prior to this change, this was a 4-5 star product given it's price bracket"
positive,"Still the Sultan: I really enjoyed this book. It gave me a behind the scenes look at the greatest baseball player of all time. Not only did I enjoy the baseball stories, but I also found the stories about the unique personality of ths man very amusing."
positive,It needs a more detailed title: I think that this book was amazing and I loved it. So it really is a great book. AWESOME BOOK
positive,it rules: shark attack files 2 is the greatest shark attack dvd that i have seen to date! I highly recomend it for any DVD shark attack enthusiasts out there. Blood and guts and disembodyment is what its all about. Get it now!
negative,"Poor quality, but at least they are sending a replacement free of charge: Worked great for 1 day, but that was it. Unfortunately, I threw out all of the packaging after I saw it worked so did not have the packaging to return to Amazon. Fortunately, Amazon still allowed me to return using the packaging from the replacement product that they sent via next day air. Good customer service, bad product, but I guess all manufacturers may make a dud now and then. We'll see how the second one works. Would have been 1 star but for good customer service on the return."
negative,"Very disappointed: Don't get me wrong, because I really enjoy Mr. King's books, but ""Dreamcatcher"" did not grab me. (not like ""Salem's Lot"" did when I was afraid for the sun to go down) The story line is boring and too long. I struggled to get through it. Sorry, but all I can say is ""Bring back the vampires!"""
positive,"Very good: This book continues the story of Ayla and Jondalar, sending them home to the Lanzadonii after quite a while of wandering about. It's well-written, with fascinating characterizations and dazzling detail. This time around, the sex didn't get in the way as much. As usual, it's a good read and gives insights into a way of life long since gone."
negative,"12 games for 9 bucks: Yep thats right 12 games for 9 Bucks. No kidding. Yeah. But the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is the fact that yeah you get all of those games but you get 2 repeats (galaga, gal Im not saying i dont like the game (considering that i bought it solely for the galaga & ms pac man) but it should be more of a selection than just having all the galaga's Some might disagree with me but oh well. The fact that it has all these old original arcade titles loves it. It would be better with a regular tv rather than a wide screen, as all the games are narrow. Funplay its like being in the arcade all over again, difficulity- that digout game is the only one that i am having trouble with! and graphics (who cares) Your playing your favorite titles which is why you bought it so dont cry for mommy if its not in HD!For the money you cant go wrong"
negative,"Spot the Squid: Perhaps the most entertaining part of this movie is watching an unintentional small luminous squid skitter across the screen about 30 minutes in.The second most entertaining part is watching with disbelief as a band of guards give up chasing a coach going five miles per hour the minute it passes through a set of gates.The movie was laughable and to be honest I couldn't sit through the whole affair.The script was awful and the actors a) should have known better; b) were really desperarte; or c) thought it was a comedy and everything would work out all right in the end.This goes into my list of movies with no redeeming features, along with Spirited Killer and Modern Vampires."
negative,"One word: outdated: This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call ""Old English"" (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to ""New English."" And trust me, it shows. Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read."
positive,"My son loves this game!: I wanted to say that I just bought the Rugrats game for PlayStation 2 for my 10 yr old son. Although I have not played it, he enjoys it if I sit in the family room and watch him play. I must say, every time I glance at the TV he is playing some new adventure. He is hooked to say the least! He likes it because it has the real Rugrats Nickelodeon characters and I like it because it is not obnoxiously violent like some other games. Two thumbs up from a parent!"
positive,"Entertaining, enjoyable, recommended: This is a sci-fi film with a good story, a mystery that gets solved, and some good action scenes. If that's what you like in films, you'll like 'I, Robot'.The special effects were probably state-of-the-art at the time (2004), but sometimes look a little dated now. This did not affect my enjoyment.If you look for subtle characterization and psychological interplay between characters, you won't find it in 'I, Robot', and you would not rate the film as highly as I do.The general background is inspired by Isaac Asimov's stories about robots, and the character of Susan Calvin is more or less the same as Asimov's Susan Calvin. But the story is new."
positive,"Living in Sedaris' Clothes: Another winner by David Sedaris. I am so enjoying getting to know this writer. In this book, we learn a bit more about his family. His mother sounds like an absolutely fabulous woman, someone I probably would have gotten along with very well. (In the hilarious ""Let it Snow"" essay, she efficiently kicks the children out of her house during a snow day, desperate for some peace and quiet. And in ""The Girl Next Door,"" she casually mocks her son's correction of her own Chinese menu interpretations. ""Oh, he speaks Chinese now! Tell me, Charlie Chan, what's the word for six straight hours of vomiting and diarrhea?"") The details of his siblings' lives are also recounted, and Sedaris guiltily acknowledges his own vulture-like tendencies to turn private family moments into public reading material. Funny, funny, funny."
negative,"Dodge These: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Literally, I could not get through it. It's juevenile, stupid, obvious humor, that treats the audience like idiots. It's sad to see Ben Stiller become an overacting film destroyer, but you can't blame this one on him. Even Vince Vaughn seemed awkward in this terrible movie, like he knew each line he delivered was worse than the previous one. Awful and horrible. I knew someone who was on a plane that showed this movie and she cimbed into the overhead compartment for the rest of the ride.If you liked this movie, I have some great footage of a dog chasing its tail for three hours that I'm sure you would enjoy."
positive,The Scarlet Letter is a really good piece of Literature: I thought that The Scarlet letter was a great piece of Literature and was a brave step for Hawthorne to take in this book during the time he wrote it. I would definatly recommend this to other readers.
positive,"Review of CycleOps Mag+ bike trainer: This is a great product for the money. Took all of about 1/2 hour to read the instructions and completely set up BUT if your rear spoke is the wrong size, you'll have to replace it with the one provided in order to use the trainer (I didn't have to thankfully). Levels of resistance are significant, although not as strong as I believed to be promised.I enjoy this (with my regular bike) significantly more than using my older exercise bike... plus, I think it'll help make riding easier when Spring comes back. Worth a purchase if you're looking for an inexpensive trainer.Even called customer service for help and they were very responsive."
positive,"Best one in Tomato Trilogy: Return of the Killer Tomatoes is hilarious. Anthony Starke is great. J. Stephen ""Rock"" Peace is back as Lt. Wilbur Finletter. This is the best movie in the Killer Tomato Triolgy."
negative,"Three words: empty, repetitive and boring: I know all opinions are subjective but I do not undertsand what you could find interesting in this movie. The love story is stereotyped. The boyfriend is an idiot (which makes the girl an even more idiot), the soundtrack is exhausting and the plot is non existing. In this type of movie there is MUCH better which has been done. Please....."
positive,Fun: I enjoyed reading the Hobbit. Not sure I ever read it as a young adult. Read in a few days so a fast read.
positive,"SIMPLY THE BEST: I am the best Lauryn Hill fan out there. Her smooth rhythymic tones are hot and out of this world. I tell you, this is the best yet. A classical hit of the late 90's."
negative,"The Worst Book Ever Written: The Lord of the Flies was without a doubt one of the stupidestand most pointless books I've ever read. Some people say it had adeeper meaning, a meaning that could change the readers life. To those people I say, ""Get a Life!"" There was no meaning or point to it at all! The book was about naked kids running around killing each other for no reason. It was retarded! It's not even worth my time writing this review - the only reason I am is to warn others who might innocently pick up the book because they heard it was good. My advice: don't waste your time or money (this book doesn't even deserve to be rated as 1, but I couldn't get negative numbers)!"
negative,"Not as good as most: I love Little Critter books, but this one isn't as good as most. It is cute, and my kids like it fine, but others are better. I think my favorite are the ones titled ""Just Me and...."""
positive,"Best of Twain: Great buy of the best of Twain Coffee table size with lots of notes. Worth reading and keeping. from Carolyn Shafer, Bought from Amazon. com"
positive,"One of my all-time favorites!: The first time I finished this book, I tried to tell all my friends and family members about the story, but could not find the words. I am so glad my fellow readers have the same difficulty in describing this wonderous tale!The second time I finished this book, I was no closer to having a description than before...and so it goes into the 4th, 5th, and even 10th reading.However, you would have to look long and hard to find more beautiful fiction. Trust me on this one...read it and enjoy a once-in-a- lifetime experience...you will be glad you did!"
negative,"That was a rough read: Maybe I went into this book with poor expectations, but I was disappointed on the content and how it was written. It read much more like a PhD thesis than a book. It was also highly one sided in it's opinions of the Church and Jewish people. I am sad to say I walked away with very little useful information."
negative,"bad: this is one of the worst movies ever made. I have no clue why it was so popular. First of all, the story is so stupid! Scorpion King? Give me a break! And the special effects look terrible. Woody Woodpecker looks more realistic. If you see this movie, be prepared to see humans interacting with cartoons most of the time. So I guess this movie is just like 'Space Jam.'"
positive,"Better than expected.: Not bad! Worth the watch! The monsters or whatever were a little weird but oh well, still some scary stuff."
negative,disappointing: This book was boreing to read because it did not follow a definite plot line and skipped from person to person. I didnt know what was happening or who it was happening to. It was a chore to read instead of a pleasure.
positive,"Most EXCELLENT - must have FUNCTIONING BRAIN to ENJOY !!!: I have seen all of the Batman movies. I am not a child but a retired baby-boomer who will always be a kid at heart. -- This movie is undoubtedly THE BEST Batman movie ever, putting ALL others in a secondary ""junk"" category !!! -- All of the actors in this production do an excellent job portraying ""real people"" in a comic book setting !!! - This movie IS NOT for the INFANTILE ""brain-dead"" who DEMAND EXPLOSIVE NOISE, BLOOD & GUTS, SKANK FEMALES EXPOSING THEMSELVES [cow-teats] and an infantile trite & trivial STORY LINE !!!And I must say ,,, NOT having female exposed private parts i.e. cow-teats, cleavage, whatever ,,, is REFRESHING !!! -- With todays garbage [cows exposing themselves] passing for movies :-( ,,, it's not often I can say I THOROUGHLY enjoyed this production !!!Thank You, Thank You, Thank You ,,, to the Production Team !!! -- I hated for it to end :-)Sincerely,Matthew"
negative,"i am the one: the costume does not open in the front. runs a little small. i have a 42inch chest and couldnt get it on. i would have still used it if i could have just worn it open, but it does not open so i sent it back"
negative,"Not Much Of A Camera: I got mine in a ""it's got to go"" sale at a local big name computer/office supply store for about $29. The directions are less-than-stellar; you're going to have to experiment. The photo quality isn't all that bad for a cheapie. Getting an updated driver from the Micro Innovations web site seems to be a chore for many buyers as there are NO drivers available as of the time of this posting. Get something good for your money."
negative,"Distasteful: I couldn't get through this book either. I originally picked it up because my name is Julia and my mom's name is Julie...so it was, literally, calling my name. I thought it would be a fun, quirky story of a woman finding herself through food...but instead it was a really abrasive, whiny story about the author, with the occasional mention of Julia Child and French cooking. Just couldn't slog through this one."
negative,"Bowie needs St. John's Wort!: What the hell happened? I was misled into thinking this album was going to be great. I hope Bowie doesn't sing these songs tousher in the new year. I really have to question themajority of Bowie fans who thought this album was his best work in twenty years. Depression must be popular again! And that's the bottom line cuz stone cold and the future world series champions ""the atlanta braves"" said so!"
positive,"Fun, fairly quick strategy game that anyone can play.: I originally bought this game after reading reviews on Amazon. It states ""ages 12 and under"", but play it almost every day with my 6 year old daughter. While she needs coaching from time to time, this is a strategy game that a young person can play that will adults will also enjoy. All but one or two of the times I have played this game it has only been with one other player, so I cannot talk a whole lot about how good the game is beyond two player. But in the two-player game, even a novice player can pick it up after one or two games and be very competitive. This game requires each player to adapt strategies to his or her opponents moves, so each game requires original thinking and planning. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a quick, competitive strategy game."
negative,Quality declined: I have bought four boxes of this product in the past year and had been very happy with it till this latest box. We had to throw away a number of the diapers because the elastic is loose and doesn't conform to the baby's thighs at all. The waistband also tears if the baby moves a lot. Very disappointed in the poor quality.
negative,"SNL downloads on amazon.com: Amazon.com doesn't tell you whether or not any of the episodes you purchase contain the music performances, no matter how much i liked. i primarily downloaded the episode because i wanted the MUSICAL PERFORMANCES, not the rest of the show! I finally downloaded the episodes and i can confirm that it does not contain any of the music performances on that particular episodes, which is a great disappointment."
positive,"It's the message: This is all about the message. The madman, The lighthouse keeper. I know it all sounds strange and all that, but listen to the words. It may just give you hope!"
negative,"Bad tube: I love this product. It is truly my go to lipgloss color. However, this particular tube leaks and gets everything in my purse all sticky. Yuck. I think the wand is loose or something. Somethings are better just picked up in store I suppose."
negative,"What more can I say?: Everything I feel about this book has already been said. It is slow moving and riddled with historical inaccuracies. I can forgive the boring writing style, because it is not my type of book. The incorrect facts, however, are harder to ignore. There are very few facts known about Mary Bolyen it shouldn't be too hard to keep them straight. That being said, if the story interests you, read it merely as a work of fiction. Then, get some Alison Weir for the history."
negative,"I guess this could be an appropriate title...: While there are juicing recipes in here there are a lot of recipes that are more appropriate for blender or food processor. As part of my resolution this year I bought a juicer but many recipes make very large quantities- Like 3 quarts or even a gallon! Um, if I need to feed juice to that many people I doubt I'd ever use my juicer and would instead by concentrate or the prepared stuff from the market. Not really helpful for the novice juicer."
positive,"Attn: CHER collectors!: This is a treasure for Cher collectors of all ages. There are actually two concerts on this dvd! First, there is the CBS special, then there is a specail feature on the dvd that allows you to watch the ""rehearsal"" of the cbs special. Cher in her normal everyday wear and sounding fabulous. Only drawback is the video footage of the rehearsal show is not professional, but it is a keepsake for CHER fans everywhere! A must have. There are also extras; crew footage describing Cher in food terms, commercial for the tour, etc."
positive,"A classic: Chilling especially given how powerful the media has become in our current society. Orwell was brilliant, and in this book, he is able to identify the critical elements of a democratic society that we often just take for granted."
negative,"Stopped working after 9 months: I'm really ticked off about this cable! I bought it in November. And now on August 1st it stopped working today. I took the laptop downstairs to another HDMI cable and it worked fine. This Cable on 2 different tvs did not work all of the sudden. I connected a Blue-Ray today and the connection was going in and out. I thought it was my wireless connection until I realized the video out to the tv was not working on the laptop where an internet connection was not necessary. No warranty.It doesn't matter if it's a good deal if it doesn't even last a year! I have HDMI cables that have been connected from receivers, etc. to the tvs for over 5 years! I won't buy from here again!."
positive,Mortal Radbat: This is one of the most enjoyable movies of all time recommend to everyone no matter what your favourite genre. Directed by the man who brought us resident evil and alien vs predator
negative,Not good: The movie skips a few scene transitions and once it got to chapter 15 I couldn't watch any of the rest of the movie at all and the file online said it was 'like new.' The disc itself looks clean but it will not play at all in my 2 week old player and three other players I tried it in.......
positive,"Deborah Smith: Read her, you will enjoy your time with her characters. Strong women, strong men, some bizarre quirks in lots of characters."
positive,"quality hiking boots in good price!: I found this boot very light and comfortable plus the fact that it's waterproof. it fits perfect in my size, it's warm and breathable too. I liked the colour very much and I was very pleased to find the product in such a good price, compared with other hiking boots that they are not waterproof at all. So far I haven't had the chance to try my boot in a heavy terrain like mud or snow but I believe that they are made for such surfaces."
negative,"Tries hard, but stereotyped and inaccurate.: Extremely well-written, good plot, characters and Mrs. Auel has done some research. Now here's the bad part. It is anthropologically inaccurate. Mrs. Auel does a beautifully stereotyped depiction of the Neanderthals as stooped, muzzle-jawed, intellectually inferior creatures as compared to wonderful Cro-Magnon people with their tall erect graceful carriage, blue eyes and blond hair. I mentioned this book to my anthropology professor and he said, very succintly, ""Burn it!&quot"
negative,"It simply does not work - Read the reviews: I bought the DSM-320 some time ago and have tried everything in an effort to make it work - latest firmware, reset, relocate, etc. etc. I've finally pulled it out of my system after watching it collect dust for several months. I highly recommend against purchasing this POS. In fact I will give mine away to anyone who cares to pay for the shipping..."
negative,"Boring: Less of a plot than the first movies. Fell asleep twice watching it, despite all the explosions....Seems like the writers may be running out of ideas"
negative,"eBooks: In my humble opinion, I find it is riduculous that eBooks cost more than books printed with ink and paper."
positive,"A Flamenco Must-Own: If you are at all a fan of or interested in Flamenco, buy this now. Paco De Lucia's masterful play is stunning at times, and every track on this album is a classic."
negative,"Break too easily: My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past."
negative,"I'd give this zero stars if possible!: After cherishing ""Anne of Green Gables"" and the sequel for many years, I couldn't believe there would finally be a third! From the time I first heard the rumor, I diligently searched the web and waited impatiently. When the Sullivan website confirmed the rumor and said it was coming soon, I couldn't believe my good fortune. I had yearned for more so intensely, it felt like I wished it into reality! I could not have been more dissapointed. Please don't buy this if you love the ""Anne"" movies! Borrow it from the library if you must. Seeing the old characters is all the pleasure you'll get from this. It's a complete failure that should go the way of ""New Coke""! Kevin Sullivan, please recall this video and make a new one that brings back the charm of the other ones. You have plenty of material from the books for the older actors. If you go with the books, you can't miss!!"
negative,"Image: Poor quality, the picture looks very bad. It seems as recorded with a VHS camera in the cinema. Do not recommend"
positive,"It gets the job done, but not exactly what I hoped for.: This product does not work well with my iOS, due to the slenderness of the iPod. If I hit a bump, the iPod will either skip, or it will be juggled out of place. It's difficult to fix, because then I have to reprogram my radio, and make sure the iOS is plugged back in. It's a lot of work while driving.I placed a small, but thick rubber band around the holder, and it keeps my iPod in place for the most part. Overall, I'm happy. I just had to pull off a MacGyver to get it to cooperate. :)"
positive,Freddie Prinze Sr.: I read this book over and over again and I love it. It gives you alot of information from the day he was born until he died. I thought his mother did an exceptional job writing this book and letting the newer generation know his legacy. Reading this book I felt like I was there. I definetly give this book 5 stars and recommened any fan of Freddie Prinze Sr. to buy it.
positive,"nice stuff: A completely expected return to form for those who have followed Mark Eitzel's career since the disintegration of AMC. Said gentleman's songwriting skills have only improved since then, as evidenced by a string of stellar solo albums; truly the only thing that's been missing is the backing of his old band. This release sounds great to me after only 3 or 4 listens, can only imagine how much I'll love it a year from now. It's still a crying shame that Mark and the boys have never gotten anywhere near the level of appreciation that they deserve, I guess this stuff is just too honest for most."
negative,"A bunch of CGI crap.....: The girl who replaces Megan Fox wears white the ENTIRE MOVIE, it borderlines stupidity. The movie is just garbage, I'm not gonna waste your time telling you every bad detail, but it almost seems that several things were done just to piss Megan Fox off completely ignoring story line."
positive,Moby_Play: Great CD. I ordered this because my pilates instructor runs this during pilates & it is great to exercise to. Now I am completly hooked & play it all the time in the car. Very eclectic music. Was as advertised.
positive,"Contact from another world.: I believe this book is true but it did not all happen as Aura wanted. Which means she has more work to do here or, on the other hand, it is about over."
positive,A pretty good adventure novel: Overall this is a well written and pleasingly paced novel. It supplies the reader with a good dose of Indy's cleverness and charm while creating a mostly engrossing journey. It does drag in parts but overall this a good addition to the Indy universe.
positive,"Michael J Fox shines....: This is Michael J Fox's at his best. The movie is very good. I can watch this one over and over. Good cast, except Sean Penn overacts his character. Definitely worth viewing."
positive,"Great little amp for the price!: I used this amp to power a pair of Anthony Gallo Micro Ti speakers, used the powered Gallo Sub. This amp is perfect for the hidden installation, and the primary connection is to an iPod doc with sVideo to the HDTV to view the choices on the iPod, and to make playlists with out connecting back up to the PC. The second input to the amp, the one that takes over when powered up and providing a signal is connected to a universal disc player, for stereo playback of cd's, and DVD audio. The AMP is quite small, and fits in the corner shaped cabinet that had a very limited depth issue for the electronics components."
positive,"good: this cd is awesome. tho i wont say its an improvement from wiretap, they do experiment a little. tracks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8-10, and 14 are all good tracks IMO. but the stand outs are tensioning and while oceana sleeps."
negative,"useless: i was very excited when I saw the ad. I planned to buy a few of macro lenses, but ...the macro lens works only for the 1/4 inch distance :-(I cannot scan a business card or an article in a newspaper, but only a few charactersI really need a macro lens but for a few inches distance"
positive,"See The Whole Instead Of Just Its Parts: This book really resonates with my philosophy that we can all accomplish a lot more by coordinating, communicating, sharing, and preparing together. Mr. de Geus frees each of us to be fully human, and to humanize the organizations we are part of. He successfully challenges the limits of the mechanical view of human interactions, and provides a great vision into what is possible. A good complement for this book is ""The 2,000 Percent Solution"" -- a book that shows each of us how to tap into our innate talents to create world-class solutions through asking and answering a better set of questions. I also recommend ""The Pursuit of Prime."" With these three books, you can accomplish anything!"
negative,"Avoid this one like the plague!: I've never in my life seen a movie so terrible, it made me wish I was dead, that is until I saw King Frat!"
positive,ive been looking everywhere: Absolutely love love love this movie. I converted it to dvd on my vhs/dvd player so that makes it 10 times better. Eliza Dushku as a kid and Juliette Lewis is Juliette Lewis. Yes!
positive,"Super Cool: If you're a Muffs fan, ya gotta love this incredible collection of outtakes, rarities, covers and whatever. Sure, first time Muffs buyers should pick up the first or second album, but this one is great if you're already sold on the band."
positive,"Fabulous! Not just a retelling of a biblical event.: David Maine has produced a modern masterpiece in what is one of the best books of the year so far. The Preservationist (or The Flood in the UK) is the story of Noah told from the perspective of his family, who are variously confounded, angered, excited, nervous or just plain stoic about his Holy orders.Maine's strength is his stunning portrayal of the women in Noah's life, viz. his wife & three daughter-in-laws. Clearly Maine loves his women and portrays them as storng characters without whom the men would fall apart ion shambles. And most of us know how true that is at any part of time or place.This is a realistically funny, poignant story told with a great sense of good humour about it, and is bound to be of enormous interest irrespective of whether one is a believer or not. A strong recommendation to anyone interested in literary fiction."
positive,"Hes real: Hes a real guy on this one, oh my. His face is scarier.Only one thing I didnt like bout this one is that hes not a comedy mood on this one.And where is his hat, theres no Freddy if theres no hat. But this one is worth watching"
negative,"Uneven, cutesy in parts, Williams overacts again: Generally unbelievable film about a man's dissolution and redemption. Jeff Bridges does a magnificent job with the material; unfortunately, Robin Williams is miscast as a crazy person (who has gone crazy by an act that was precipitated by Jeff Bridges' character). Williams should have played his part with some degree of complexity, but all that comes out is tics and showiness. What a shame. The script is uneven, in parts very insightful and in other places simply stupid (the dinner with the four main characters is just awful). If a the movie and therefore the script had been shortened by 30 minutes, the movie would have been much better. As it is, the unbelievability overwhelms whatever good points the movie has. Too bad."
negative,"A PERSONAL NOTE TO CLIVE DAVIS & ARNOLD STIEFEL: NOTE TO CLIVE and ARNIE: Think about the legacy. Think about songs like Maggie May, Every Picture Tells A Store, Scared and Scarred, The Wild Horse, Lost in You, Go Out Dancing, I Was Only Joking, The Killing of Georgie, Mandolin Wind, Italian Girls, Is That the THanks I Get?, Rebel Heart, You're in My Heart, Lady Luck, Every Beat of My Heart, A Night Like This, Stone Cold Sober, Young Turks, Moment of Glory, Dynamite, etc, etc.,,,,You are not doing the public a favor--you are robbing us of one of Rock's best songwriters. You and Rod have enough money. Think quality. Please. I am begging.......Rod doing so-so version of so-so songs is boring and so beneath his talent. This album is well beneath the talent of one Roderick Stewart. GIVE US OUR ROCK STAR BACK!!!!!"
negative,"Kerry Kamera Hound Risking Lives: Taking cheap political photo Op's while endangering my fellow Naval comrads' lives was reckless and insensitive. Kerry was booted out of VN due to his reckless disregard for the well being of his comrads' lives. After being kicked out of VN Kerry had a Hissy Fit Snit and Said ""I will show them"", and proceeded to betray his comrads all over again. We do not need a man with 57 positions on every issue that squeals like a stuck pig when the real truth comes out via Swiftees and/or Givem Hell Zell! When $62 million in ""drug money"" was spent to castigeate Bush it was OK; however the boonie is now on the other foot. The boonie now needs to be lodged in Kerry's appropriate 57 part anatomy."
negative,"Disappointing: Weak story, Characters were not interesting or engaging and Vampire rules were silly. Also tired of the Gay=slutty and incapable of an adult relationship. Can't we do better?"
positive,THE MAGIC ORANGE TREE: Is a really good book!!! Easy for kids to learn. I will recommend this book to other family. I PERSONALLY ENJOY READ TO MY LITTLE ONE.
negative,Ok but not for your first Washington biography: The author covers a lot of ground in a very limited number of pages. The result is a lack of a general biographical sketch of Washington. I would agree with other reviews that a more comprehensive biography would be a better choice for a first read on Washington.
negative,I didn't like them: Can't say if this is a good product or not but the really got in the way while I was typing on my computer at work. My doctor suggested them for my tremors but they where to uncomfortable for me. You may like them for what you are using them for. Not a negative review this is more a personal choice review.
positive,"My favorite!!: I collect Jim Shore cats, and I have to say that this one is just amazing. The colors are so beautiful. The figurine is also quite large. Such a great purchase! Buy it, you won't regret it!!!"
negative,boring and pointless: This is a 'kiddie book' that even my 7 yearold brother won't read. I don't remember when I had ever read a book so boring and pointless.
positive,"The Day the World Came to Town: 9/11 in Gander, Newfoundland: This is one of the most affirming books I have read in a long time. When you begin to doubt the goodness of people, books such as this eradicate all of that doubt. I also bought copies for two other people."
positive,"Read this book: Amazingly written!! Ray Bradbury is a visionary. The book was intriguing, and suspenseful. When I read it I couldn't put it down!"
negative,"Disappointing and dangerous: Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. What I got was never quite up to speed, but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in, the quick charge wasn't a must. Unfortunately, after a scant 8 months, with very little movement or unplugging (I've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time), the power cord has given out. There seems to be a short between the wires, with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire. Needless to say, I'm not going back to this product!"
positive,"It's a Pot: Here's how I judge my standard appliances... Do they work? Are they easy to use? Are they fun to use? Do they add any extra features? Would I buy it again?Most importantly, this pot works. The handles don't retain heat and they are safe to touch. I've made some good pasta sauce in it and the whole thing didn't combust on itself. I haven't put it through the dishwasher so I can't tell you how it holds up, though my other Farberware products have held up good. This pot is about as fun as you can get for a pot. Plus, you can say to people, ""Hey - check out this huge pot I just bought."""
negative,"Good music marred by terrible production: DVD has tremendous potential for music. While few movies are worth more than a single viewing, a good music video bears repeating. This DVD is about as bad as they come. Too much talk, not enough music. A voiceover is presented during ""Blue Sky"", which has one of my favorite AB's guitar solos. Most upsetting is that the closing credits are displayed while the band plays ""Whipping Post""."
positive,"Awesome: I bought this book for my class on persuasion. It does not read like a textbook, its a trade. So it is a lot of fun to read and really informational. Makes you look at the media in a different light, I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone really. Not just for communication majors, it is for anyone who is interested in mass media."
positive,"Nice color: I looked far and wide for a medium to light brown eyeliner pencil and this one turned out to be perfect. If you have blonde hair, you can look a little trashy wearing black eyeliner, so this is a wonderful find."
negative,"the flat bed: We purchased this product on 10/27/09. In less than a month, it already began leaking. I would not recommend this product."
positive,"Must have for twins: I am very pleased with my recent purchase of 4 boxes of Pampers. Delivery was super-fast (and free), faster than I expected. Having twins, this is the way to go; no having to tote two babies, and a 3 yr old, into the store to buy them."
negative,"This film is horrible: As a fan of post-apocalyptic movies, I must say that this movie is as far from post-apocalyptic as a post-apocalyptic movie can get. The majority of the movie is explained on the back cover- Mad Max is a cop whose family has been killed and he must seek revenge. But the seeking revenge part is just about 4 or 5 scenes towards the end of the movie! And to top it all off it seems like the apocalypse has had absolutely no effect on the world, because trees are growing, there's power, water, civilization, medicine, and ice cream! Jeez!"
negative,"junk!!!!!!: I have been a carpenter for over 35 years and I have rarely seen a bigger piece of crap than this tool. Where do i start...The magazine is made out of plastic. Some times the nails don't come out at all and other times they go shooting sideways through the chintzy plastic magazine. And it also has a hair trigger magazine release that is situated painfully close to the firing trigger. all it takes is a light bump on the magazine release and it does just that. So expect the whole thing to open up and fall apart on you often. I wound up zip tying the damn thing back just so that I could get through the last project I used it on. The shoe also has issues. It has a thumbscrew adjustment that self adjusts as you work. I can't tell you how thrilled I was to discover this the first time I used it. I've thought about selling it on ebay ""as is"" but i don't want to screw someone else with this POS. Buy anything else but this thing or you will regret it. I hate it!!!!!"
positive,"This book truly changed my life!: I have never read a book so true and blunt. While I thought being a ""bitch"" was something bad, after reading this book I realized Being a bitch is a good thing. I stopped giving men everything they wanted while putting myself on the back burner. I am important too and there is nothing wrong with respecting myself. Do yourself a favor and get this book, you won't regret It!"
positive,"Perfect- Holds Much More Than Expected: This is a great product. Sturdy, space-efficient and well designed. It holds two to three loads of laundry, handles the weight of wet clothes with ease and folds to a reasonably sized rectangle for storage."
negative,"Don't Have Great Expectations For This Novel.: You won't be needing a bookmark with this novel- more like a pillow! I read this my freshman year of high school, maybe I was just too young to understand it and appreciate it, but I could not read the whole thing without falling asleep. After reading half the book, I read the cliff notes and actually found them more interesting than the novel itself. Unless you are suffering from insomnia, I wouldn't buy it."
negative,"Can't use it, can't return it.: I was really looking forward to using this item. However, upon opening it I was overcome with a strong chemical odor. The packaging says ""for novelty only"" which means, it's not safe. I did some research and found out this could actually cause cancer. Of course, I can't even return the stupid thing eventhough I never used it. Shame on you people for selling shoddy products that can esentially kill people."
negative,"Not worth it!: This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!"
negative,"A Great band but a most disappointing DVD: I Purchased the DVD with great anticipation only after viewing the VHS copy I had in my music collection, What were they thinking. Interruptions during the music with interviews although I like the interviews put it on a different track (Angle). Most songs were edited so you do not get the complete song, Guitar solos missing, Drum solo cut short, Whipping Post 2 minutes? With today's technology I would have expected better, much better than the VHS. The running time is not 90 minutes I am returning my DVD today. I am a southern rock lover, as well as a Allman fan but this DVD Stinks."
negative,"trouble with car not matts: Matt on driver side slides forward and I have not found a way to anchor it. It would be better if the Broncos had gone to the Super Bowl in 2013. The ""Prayer in thin Air"" did them in or was it ""The kneel down in D Town?"""
negative,"THE WORST THING EVER CREATED: I'm sure you can see by now with everyone else's reviews that this product is garbage. Well, hey, if you pay close to nothing, don't expect anything much in return! Just save yourself the money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... instead, put some gas in your car or something!"
positive,Nice Gift: The tea chest itself is quite pretty. I bought several to give as gifts. There's a nice variety of tea inside and some really good flavors of green tea.The one downside of the chest? That the company pastes a label on the bottom of the chest and it is NOT easily removed. The label covers the entire bottom of the chest. It would be nice if they at least made it so you can remove it without leaving the wood looking worse for wear. I realize a label isn't a big deal; I just prefer to give a gift without the unsightly label.
positive,"Surprisingly Good=)!!: This book was one that i wish i would of read when i was suppose to in 9th grade. It was once we reached the middle of the book i realized how good it was. I am one of those students who hate reading those long novels about nothing important. Even though my teacher said it was one of the shortest novels we would ever read! After only reading the middle to the end. I just had to check this book out for myself! Once you begin this book, you may think it starts off boring..but keep going becuase youll never want to put it down. It teackes you about loyalty and friendship in real life situations. This is a book i would read over and over again!.Try this book out..you'll really like it!"
positive,Prime Suspect Series: Helen Mirren is a professional work of art in herself. I am the proud owner of the Prime Suspect series 1 through 6 and have just caught up with No. 1 thanks to prompt delivery courtesy of Amazon.It has been some time since I have seen No.1 but I wasn't dissapointed and thoroughly enjoyed the interplay between the characters culminating in the final courtroom scene. How did it go down??? Look and see
positive,"Classic: Classic old time Marty Robbins. With his special voice, he's a hard act to follow. A good CD for Marty fans."
positive,It is a Christmas gift.: The shoe tree is a gift. All I know is that it came in a box with a picture of a shoe tree on it.
negative,"Poorly designed: This phone is so poorly designed that I returned it after 1 month. The primary issues are ...(1) You always have to press the ""Talk"" button 3 times (not once) in order to get a dial tone.(2) When a voice message is waiting, the phone beeps loudly every 30 seconds. Very annoying when you let the phone take a message because you are preoccupied or have company visiting.(3) If you have the base wallmounted, the handset does not rest securely in the base -- Half the time it falls off when you set it down."
negative,"Awful writing!: In full disclosure, I have not read more than a few pages here and there in any of the Warriors books. My 8 year old daughter absolutely loves them, but what little I have read when reading with her is just gawd-awful. Thank goodness she can read these by herself. I find it hard to believe the spectacular ratings these books have received here. I found the writing to be almost unbearable. The author uses the same few adjectives, verbs and adverbs over and over again, and she seems incapable of writing a sentence that does not contain the repetitive names of two or more cats. Has she never heard of pronouns? Maybe the story is compelling, I wouldn't know, but no story could be compelling enough to make me wade through this horrible writing. True, the target audience of these books is very young, but writing for a third-grader does not mean one has to write LIKE a third-grader."
positive,"Terrific movie, well formatted DVD: This is probably my favorite DVD. I'm a long time fan of the movie and this edition makes it even better with all the extra features. A must-have for any s.f. buff."
negative,"No scientic research: The basic premise of this entire book and the philosophy of Masaru Emoto is that water crystals are affected by thoughts, attitudes and feelings. This is a very exciting idea and one that I really do want to believe in.However, never in this book is there any scientific research - absolutely none. The most basic principle of scientific research is reproducible results by reputable third parties. Who are Emoto-son's researchers? Allow me to quote, ""I wrote this experiment in the book that I published, and as a result hundreds of families throughout Japan conducted this same experiment for themselves. EVERYONE reported the same results."" And that's all you get folks!Really, I want to believe, I really do, but show some respect to human logic and scientific discipline. If there is ANY real research it should be in the book."
negative,"Not much Brigitte Bako: I was hoping to see a lot of Brigitte Bako. There is nothing to see. There are no ""bedroom scenes"". Unless clothed petting is offensive."
negative,"One Of The Worst Anne Rice Books!: I have to say that this is one of the worst novels that she has ever written. I just didn't think that it was that entertaining. After finishing the book, I went out and rented the movie, and It is far better than this novel. I am sorry Anne rice, but I can see why you used a pseudo name when you wrote this book. It stinks!"
positive,"so far so good: I recently bought this phone. I really like the phone so far. It is great to retrieve voicemail, it even stores your password to make it simple. It stores 50 names and numbers which make using the address book a pleasure. The clarity so far are very good and the speakerphone is awesome. The only two improvements I can think of is one: there is no speed dialing from the headset, and two entering the directory takes one too many keystrokes. Other then that great solid phone."
positive,"God's Zoo: Wonderful video, very comical and loved by kids, also teaches some good Biblical truths and good gospel songs."
negative,"Unscientific and under-researched: I found this book to be of little to no value.The author neglects to mention uses of several of the plants in her book. For example, the author makes no mention of using burdock or Queen Anne's lace for there roots. The roots of burdock are a delicacy in Japan.Additionally,wood sorrel should come with a warning to avoid consuming large amounts. The oxalic acid in wood sorrel can cause kidney stones in certain people.The author give no tips on identifying the plants referenced. Even more disturbing is the use of plants that have poionous copy cat plants, and the user is not warned individually about these plants. (Water Hemlock and Queen Anne's Lace, balsam and yew).(...). And if you are goingto eat the weeds, there are certainly resources with better content, and safety warnings than this book contains.-Your friendly forager"
positive,"Good Movie, worth watching: This movie was good, because it show's that Van Damme doesn't have to kick the crap out of people to star in a movie. It has a good story to it and some emotional scenes that show Van Damme's true acting abilities. Definitly worth renting."
negative,Junk: The sprinkler will not oscillate reliably. The whole purpose of an oscillating sprinkler is so that you do not have to stand around watering your lawn but with this sprinkler you have to keep helping it when it gets stuck or you will only water one thin line of your lawn. Don't waste your time on this product.
negative,"Lost In Translation: I have this Allman Brothers Band performance in VHS format, and it is amazing. A really classic performance featuring Greg Allman, Dickey Betts, Warren Hayes, Allen Woody and the rest. What a major disappointment with this transer to DVD. While the DVD format gives great color and resolution, there is a deluge of unsavory editing. In the middle of key live performances, interviews are spliced in. (...)But the real travesty is the omission of material from the VHS version, and the rolling of credits while the band blazes on Whippin' Post. This great song is literally cut short in mid-performance. The potential for a great presentation in the DVD format is lost in the editing. The running time claimed is ""approx. 90 minutes"", while it actually is less than 60 minutes. Sloppy job Sony!!!"
positive,"Best rice cooker I've ever had: This is by far the best rice cooker I've had. In the past, I've used Hitachi and National rice cookers that basically just heat up and cook the rice. This Zojirushi cooks the rice very evenly. I prefer my rice soft yet still resilient and the normal setting does that. It also keeps the rice from drying out if you leave it to warm. I've left it for a couple of hours and the rice remined perfect. Also, this rice cooker is quite easy to use. I highly recommend this model."
negative,"They canceled my order!: I ordered this as a Christmas gift on 12/13. On 12/19 I received an email that they canceled my order, the end. No explanation, nothing. (Other than my card would not be charged) I had to pay expedited shipping somewhere else to get a gift delivered by Christmas. Extremely unprofessional business practice to wait so long on the notification of cancellation."
positive,"Great Shelter and Play tent: We bought this as a last- moment decision before a trip to Hawaii - I was concerned my 6 month old would get too much sun and sand or I would have to hold him too much while he is so wiggly. This did the trick! He stayed in with his toys, and now my 3 yr old has it up in a play space for privacy. Good purchase for us."
positive,"De Palma is a master...a great spy film: First of all, there is a reason why this film is so great. Brian De Palma directed it! De Palma is a master visualist and this movie looks like none other. De Palma makes complete use of depth within the frame and his visual style is unmatched by any director working today (Scorsese being the exception) so this film (unlike MI2) holds up and is still interesting & riveting after repeated viewings. MI2 is a stupid, cliched plot with lotsa action and explosions I have already seen. This one really makes you think when you watch it and the way the spy/action/suspense scenes are directed & handled are wonderful. Also, a great script from David Koepp & the legendary Robert Towne"
positive,"Fascinating science; now I'm hooked on Kathy Reichs: If you like the science behind forensic pathology, you'll get hooked on Kathy Reichs reading this book. The plot and characters seem rather unlikely - but no more so than most of the classic mystery writers - and the book carries you along rapidly. I read this in one sitting - I recommend it."
positive,"Sassy, funny and smart!: This is Meryl at her funny best. What more can you say when the screenplay is based on the best selling book by Carrie Fisher! And Carrie wrote the screenplay too! Ms. Fisher is well known in Hollywood as THE person to call if your script needs ""pumping up"". She calls herself a ""Script Nurse""!! Too funny! And yes, she is very well paid for her services! By the way, Annette Benning got her big break in this film! She played the actress playing the hooker on the movie set. She only had a few lines, but everyone said ""WHO WAS THAT?""!!. Hollywood took notice..the rest is history! Shirley M.'s caracter IS the fading Hollywood star. She is so full of life..and herself!! Anyway, this is an excellent, entertaining movie. A Mike Nichols directed film, so you can bet it's top notch!!!"
negative,Dont buy this book: This is not a good written book. It looks like that the information is gathered from various sources and put together without explaining the important details. It tells an overview of the struts but fails to explain how and why. Even the elements of struts-config.xml are not explained in thorough detail and how they are related to each other. I would not recommend this book.
positive,Wonderful!: This book is wonderful. You get caught up in the story of Krabat and his friends (and foes) at the mill of black magic. The earthiness of the story is great.
positive,TiVo Wireless G USB Network Adapter for Series2 DVR: Adapter very easy to install and worked immediately. Keeps TiVo up to date with no user intervention. Also allows connection from any PC with Free TiVo Desktop software.
negative,"had some problems: Right from the beginning, had problems with this device. Could not switch from Celsius to Farenheit on the outside device ... constant beeping ... then just quit. Timex did quickly send a new one when sent in under warranty."
negative,I think they are wrong?: Question how can this be a new extended dvd if the old one is 128 mins? this one is 127 mins.
negative,All That Glitters The Crime and The Coverup: I was just wondering if I could please have my money back. When is this man going to confess that his brother worte this while the whole thing was going on if not before.All I can say is YUCK.
negative,"battery charger: The charger was received with the large transformer flopping around in the case of the charger, i contacted the manufacturer of the charger and they said i would have to pay $25 shipping on it, and they would repair the charger???? I think their quality control needs to be improved and i don't feel i should pay $25 shipping to have a new charger repaired."
negative,"meh...: I am aware that when I review this and say I strongly disliked this book am in the minorty. The plot of The Hobbit was good and interesting. However the author was very wordy and overly desctiptive and after a while it got annoying. reading this was like chewing cardboard, flavorful cardboard, because of the interesting plot, but cardboard nonetheless.I read the unabriged edition and so the abriged vertion may be less wordy and therefore better."
positive,"pleasure to read, great teaser for the ""Lord of the Rings"": Tolkien's ""Hobbit"" is an important precursor story for the ""Lord of The Rings"" trilogy. Bilbo, Gandalf, Gollum and mostly important the story of the Ring are introduced in this book. There are also a whole bunch of interesting infromation about the dwarfs and the elves, about ents, Kingdom of Mirkwood and all sorts of captivating magic.This particular edition is a pure pleasure to read. It is right in all proportions, smells nice, opens well, printed nicely and have some great illustrations. Great as a gift or a bedtime story read! Enjoy...."
positive,"amazing: When I first heard the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim, I fell in love with it. He is possibly the greatest composer of the century. His music is simply incredible. Anyone that does not own this CD should run out and get it immediately, along with his other CDs. My favorite songs are ""Triste,"" ""Inutil Paisagem,"" and ""Agua De Beber,"" but they're ALL good, I promise."
negative,Emergecny Use Only and Questionable: This is def not a great or a well made item. It is about the thickness of two one time use panchos but much larger. It will do in a pinch. Even at only $10.00 I was surprised that is was so thin; you can actually see right thru it. It is light weight and if the weather isn't bad/ not too hot nor too cold it would do. It doesn't have any sides so you could cut some large trash bags to cover the sides to keep rain out if need be. Just don't forget to pack some duck tape with it.Honestly; I'd rather rely on a poncho or tarp it would offer much better protection and is so much studier. Not bad for dire emergency but I would spend an extra $5 or $7 and get a good tarp I think you'll be much better protected.I don't recommend the product.
positive,"GREAT WEATHER AND EMERGENCY RADIO: A must have for those in the tornado areas, with it's silent monitoring. Also great for sailing in so calif waters where Santa Ana winds can occur with little specific warning.I think some of the writers did not fully explore the setup wich appers to allow you to limit the warnings to a specific part of the area covered by the broadcasts.Several times the radio has awakened after months of standby operation and in the middle of the night announced a flash flood alert for my area. It also has very significant value in providing information after a natural disaster or terrorist attack.Oregon Scientific is a great company. As for the customer who dropped his radio after three years and expected free repair or replacement, that's not the deal today with something this inexpensive.Highly recommended for what it does but the family should also have a battery operated radio for emergency use. E"
negative,"Hurts To Listen To: When seeing this in the record store, I was drawn to the sticker on the front featuring Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, From Autumn To Ashes and Poison The Well. All amazing bands in their own respects, but this album should not be compared to these bands or their albums. This cd has some interesting instrumental work but nothing spectacular. The vocals sound dry and uninteresting. All in all, this album was a big disappointment. The sticker throws the consumer right off, it is decieving."
negative,"disappointing...: How very deceiving the other reviews have been! I wonder if the author or his friends posted them. I read them and bought the book thinking it might offer a humorous side on the everyday life of Americans...I was very disappointed. I could not even smile. Grotesque, in some parts ourtight disgusting...miserly low class American life...at its worst. No wonder the author moved to Paris, although I do not doubt that ""the city will always follow him""... If he has read the Greeks, he will know whom I am referring to....Don't waste your money on this one."
positive,"It was a good book and also intersting: If I had to choose between the book and the movie, I'd choose the book. This book was a little bit difficult for me, becauce of the details and the feelings. But I liked the conversation between the characters and I also liked that the book was very dynamic.I recommend this book to anybody who likes to read. I think this is a good novel ""Lord Of The Flies"" because it makes you think about how the world is working now."
positive,Good Book for Rook or Vet: I bought this as a text for a class but I'm finding it very thorough and easy to follow with tons of good info.
positive,"Fascinating book: I have only been a Witch for a little over a year, so I still consider myself a begininner.I really liked her section about the science of Witchcraft. It intrigued me so much that I am planning to find out more about it!I don't know if it's the first book people who have just become Witches should read, I think it might be a little too complex for absolute begininners, but it's a great book for someone who already has some basic knowledge about The Craft of the Wise."
positive,"simply the best: this is by far the best lubricant i have ever used, and i haven't even thought about using another one since i found pjur 2 years ago. it never gets sticky and feels super silky."
positive,"Simply Wonderful: This is movie making like, well, like they don't make any more. Great acting, great chemistry, totally fun. Throw away the modern movies geared to 12 year olds and buy this for the sheer pleasure of watching two of the most wonderful performers ever to grace our movie screens.Frank Scoblete: author of Golden Touch Dice Control Revolution!"
positive,Always loved this movie: I would recommend this movie. Good story line. Such a great cast. I enjoyed it so many years ago and enjoyed it as much now.
negative,"Ty Beanie Babies Dog: Don't waste your money on this one. It does not look like the photo. The product is uglier and thinner, and forget trying to comb or fluff the fur. It won't happen."
positive,"An invaluable style and reference manual for advertising copywriters: This is the best style manual for advertising copywriters on the market. There may be a new edition that supercedes this one by the time you read this. if so, I would buy it without reservation. I find myself reaching for this time and again when I write. Highly recommended."
positive,"Jivin' Swing Sounds: I have been looking for this CD for a while and Amazon had it in great condition at a superb price. I love the Cherry Poppin' Daddies but had not owned any of their music. To be a true collector, you must begin with Zoot Suit Riot. Although it is music of a time gone by, the Daddies enliven it and the voices are current and the music so clear and energetic that I can't sit still when hearing it. These songs are certainly a mood lifter! They may me laugh, dance and feel good ! Great background music for a party for all age groups.Don't miss out on this sound in your musical collection. The daddies are the best at what they do and sometimes you want to just let your hair down and have a little fun !Treat yourself ! The prices are right at Amazon.com !"
negative,"Very Disappointed: I just purchased the new Clay Aiken CD and I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in my life. I feel like this man's beautiful voice is no where even near 10% of what it is capable of on this album. Most of the songs don't even sound like him. I have waited for this to come out because his voice sends goosebumps up my spine when he hits ""those notes"", and I skipped through every song on this album and found none that even came close. I hope that Clay speaks up and says, this is not the measure of me, and his next album show cases his God given talent. When you hear songs like ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" that are amazing and then listen to this album, you cannot even begin to compare. The only reason I gave it one star is because of the song ""This is The Night,"" other then that, I would not have rated it."
positive,"Long Trip Alone (I don't think so): In his third release Dierks makes it clear he is here to stay with strong vocals and song writing abilities. He has co-written every song on this CD and it shows in the way he comes across in the music. It's a journey from the first track to the last one, one that you won't want to end anytime soon."
negative,"BEWARE: We ordered this set, got it in a timely fashion, opened it and the second DVD was NOT the Rankin-Bass animated special as it is supposed to be (and as is described on the box), but an awful live action film of the same name (""the year without a santa claus"") from 2006 starring John Goodman. I alerted Amazon, and they sent a second set. I opened it today and it has THE SAME PROBLEM. I am sending both back and do not want to go through this again. Someone was asleep at the packaging wheel and who knows how many more box these boxed sets have the same problem. Be warned."
positive,"Gregg Allman Biography: I would recommend these products to anyone for any reason. If you like anything about music or behind the scenes, these books are really good."
negative,Awful: This was a terrible movie. Liam Neeson and Sandra Bullock should have stayed far away from this movie and made sure it was never released. The only redeeming feature was the performance of Oliver Platt.
positive,Soho crime: Very interesting read. I loved the way he incorporated the Japanese customs into the book which made it all the more interesting. Certainly a different style of crime book
positive,Nice Radio: Works good now. Had to send it back. (No Modulation) Standard fixed it quickly. Have other Standard Horizon/yaesu radios and they are high quality radios.I use it with the Coast Guard Aux.
negative,"Terrible textbook: This is the course book assigned by my college professor. I found the book to be disorganized, confusing and incomplete. Vocabulary words are often spread out throughout the chapter in odd places. The exercices will give you the question, but no sample answer so you can't understand the structure of the sentence you are supposed to be responding in. Often times they will provide you with a vocab word, but no translation beside it. You have to look it up in the back of the book or somehow manage to interpret the difference between a picture of an aunt and your sister.If your instructor has assigned this book, you're better off getting another textbook to understand what this one is saying."
positive,Best skillet I own: This skillet is excellent for the price. The non-stick coating on this pan is REALLY slick and I easily cook up eggs for breakfast where others stick and fail. Even heat distribution and great construction round out the package. I wish larger Anolon skillets were more competitively priced-I would surely buy more to complete my set. Highly recommended.
negative,Gillette razor blades: I purchased blades from Amazon before but these blades seem to.be very old and scratch the faceI will not purchase again
negative,"These break wayyy too much.: Don't get me wrong, these condoms make it feel as if you're not wearing anything if there's enough lubricant. The problem is, the second you start getting a little rough and start deep thrusting, these things break easily. I've had them break on me three times. They are also a little tight. I threw mine away. I'll be sticking with Trojan."
negative,bzzzzz: This UPS has an internal 24 volt fan (with no fresh air intake or exhaust!) that makes the whole case buzz. Mine looks nice but when the power goes out it just lights up overload (on what it says is a 216 watt load in the Windows application) and the computer instantly turns off. Too bad I voided the warranty on mine trying to replace the fan with something more quiet. I used to be a big APC fan but this is a poorly designed product.
negative,"Just in case anyone is as stupid as I am: This may be the best product out there ... I wouldn't know because I had no idea what I was ordering. It didn't dawn on me when it said pneumatic that I had to have an ""air supply"" ... plus it doesn't have any grinding points. I just wanted something to etch my name on the metal prints of my artwork. So back it goes and I'll look for something that's simple enough for me to understand what it is and how to use it."
positive,NOTHING LESS THAN 5 STARS: WOW--WOW--WOW---GREAT BOOK---WHAT A CLASSIC---CAN YOU BELIEVE THATIT WAS WRITTEN IN 1869??? YEARS & YEARSAHEAD OF ITS TIME. GREAT READ.
positive,This was a great book: I read the book The Castle in the Attic and I really enjoyed it. My favorite part was when William meets Sir Simon and sees the castle. I like this part because William gets scared and drops him on the floor. Will they become friends or not? Find out by reading the book.
positive,Curious about a career in Radio?: This book should be course-required reading for those aspiring to a career in radio. As a student studying broadcast communications this book has been invaluable at framing the industry and providing insight into the nuances of the medium. Mr McCoy has been a pioneer in the industry and has consistently inspired creativity in others... this book continues that trend.
positive,"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU!: When I read this story, I was amazed. Though it's written 50 years ago, you can find some things that really exist in our time. Maybe not as terrible but terrible enough. This story is a vision on the future. A future that may come sooner that we expect. I recommend this book to every book lover, this one you can't miss, and remember: Big brother is watching you!"
negative,"Less than 3 weeks old and is a cracked, moldy piece of junk: This thing looks good in the pictures, but I immediately regret only reading the first few reviews. The negative reviews are 100% correct. I had this thing delivered on 2/16/12, and I threw it away yesterday (3/4/12), as it was cracked, peeled, and starting to mold. Do Not Buy this item."
positive,"Eragon: I thought this book was exiting, yet slow at times there was action, but the plot is fantastic. I enjoyed reading the book but it gave me nothing to ponder. But a good read for Tolkien fans."
negative,"Disappointed-Wanted to hear the older songs!: I ordered this CD when the tracks listed included Lobo, and the correct artist for ""Lean On Me,"" etc. Once I got the CD, it had completely different tracks, and I wanted to hear tracks from the first two parts of the show. I am not happy with the final tracks for the CD. It was a let down."
negative,"Illegible: It was an illegible **photocopy**. It appeared as if someone took a picture of every page of an original ""Principles of Science"", then faxed those pictures to the printer in order to produce this book.I returned it immediately."
positive,"Moby's layers are thick: Play gives me the same 'lost' feeling when I listen to Orbit's 'Pieces'. Funny, original, loose and a bit sexystrange, fresh and almost perfect for every situation. But PLAY is a lot deeper than that. These pieces are sophisticated, unmitigated and very smart. The album often frightens me, then I turn it off and wonder when Moby looks serious."
negative,"Drawn out: After reading the reviews I was excited to watch this film. I found the plot to be very drawn out, predictable, and somewhat dull. I would recommend watching this if you have 2 hours of your life that you don't mind squandering and don't care if you come away from that wasted time with nothing to show for it. Enjoy the film."
negative,"They're Right - Stay Far, Far Away From This Printer!: I would like to add my voice to the Choir of Dismay, Frustration and Anger at this Piece of Crap printer. There was a time (long ago) that HP was a good brand that made good printers. Not now, Folks. I have had nothing but headaches with this printer that won't print. Paper Jams or never picks up the page, and now it's making horrible, grinding noises. I'm looking around for a printer that will actually print. The install was another headache, btw. I wish negative stars were an option - I didn't even want to give it one.On its behalf, I will say that the card reader and scanner are decent. The copier's okay, too. But, IT'S A PRINTER. That's my main reason for needing it... Duh!"
positive,Good Vacuum!: We really like this vacuum. We moved into our new house and it was amazing how much it sucked up. It is easy to use on stairs and has a nice attachment for that. It is also easy to clean and remove the bagless part of the vacuum. Really happy with this little red Hoover.
positive,What I Did Not Know About Benjamin Franklin: I read an article about Ben Franklin in a local newspaper a few years back and was always wondering if the article was correct historically or if it was a lot of religious fiction and the writer did a poor job of writing as she did not seem to have her facts straight.I am not all convinced that autobiographies are 100% correct as the writer (ghost writers) have a book to sell and making it interesting may be more on the platter that correctness. In any event you will enjoy reading this version of Ben's autobiography to find out a little more than the history and religious writers have written.
positive,""" . . . and nothin' but the proof."": This book is beyond beleif. The authors do more than quote old sources. They actually give it to you. When a Jehova's Witness says ""We never taught that,"" you will have the documented proof in your hands. The book contains photostated articles from their organizations early days to the present which show how dramatically their beleifs have changed, and the lengths that their leaders will go through to keep their members fooled. Get this book. Read it, and share it with your Jehovah's Witness freind or relative."
negative,"This book cries out for an editor: The premise of this book is simple: (1) People spend too much money on luxury goods, (2) less wealthy people spend more on luxury goods because super rich people spend a great deal, and (3) we'd all be better off if people spent less on luxury goods and more on helping others. Everything of value in this book might make a short article in a magazine - expanding it into a book makes it mind numbing. Unless you have an extremely high tolerance for reading the same thing over and over, pass on this book."
positive,"Love!: I liked this so much for my first baby that I have already purchased another to use for the next expected baby. I like that there was minimal fill-in-the-blank (because I always feel bad leaving blanks, but didn't always have anything applicable to fill in for each and every question) and there is a ton of space for narratives & anecdotes. Plus, the design is beyond adorable."
negative,"Not uplifting like the rest of her work: As usual, the composition of the pieces on this CD were done beautifully, but I was disappointed. I like everything I've heard by Enya thus far, but I hadn't listened to this CD before buying it. I found the music to be a real downer and depressing...the kind of music you put on if you need a good cry. I had hoped it would be uplifting like the rest of her CD's. Enya is very talented and everything she does is outstanding including this CD, it just wasn't the type of music I had wanted."
negative,"Probably wouldn't buy again, but it worked.: It was a chore getting this grass to stay down in the tank, but finally managed to use a few sprigs of it. If you purchase it, leave it is large of a section as you can, put it down first, then dump your rocks/sand on top of it and pull it up to height. Also, the sprigs were not as ""soft"" as I was hoping. No motion underwater."
positive,Great & Scary: I read this book to my little brothers and they had nightmares for weeks so you may want to preview it before you let younger readers read it. It is a great story though and I was very entertained by the story of a robot who needs human eyes.
positive,"A masterpiece!: I found 1984 to be a fascinating and realistic portrayal of human nature. Orwell's insight into the nature of governments is amazing and enlightening. He has this detached, slightly pessimistic attitude toward human nature that I love. He is so frank about man's selfishness and greed -- not only as it relates to the governments in 1984, but also to the rebels like Winston who, in the end, care only for themselves. There are no glamorous heroes in 1984 just as there are any in real life. Orwell has stripped man of all glory and glamour and shown him in an honest, if unflattering, light.I was also very impressed with Orwell's thoroughness. He described the society, the history and, most of all, the language of the futuristic Oceania in such detail. 1984 is truly a masterpiece."
negative,"EVEN A NIRVANA CD IS A BILLION TIMES BETTER.: GOD DAMN, THIS IS THE WORST ALBUM EVER CREATED EVER!!! EVERY SONG ON THIS IS A BIG TURD. THE STONES WERE AMONGST THE WORST BANDS IN HISTORY ALONG WITH LYNYRD SKYNYRD. NIRVANA NEVERMIND IS A BILLION TIMES BETTER. GO GET THAT INSTED."
positive,"best album I've heard in a while: On my first listen to 'Catch Without Arms,' I was a little disappointed. I had been hoping for something that was closer in style to Leitmotif, but that's not what they delivered. But after listening to it a few times, I've gotten over the fact that their style has diverged a bit from their original sound. And, now I think that I do like 'Catch Without Arms' even more than their previous efforts."
positive,"NBA 2k3 VS NBA 2003!!!!: Unlike the other reviewers, i'll compare the two best B-ball game on the market for ya. I got BOTH!GRaphic-NBA2003 had better graphics, smoother movement and brighter textures.Sound-NBA2k3, cuz of ESPN!!!Value-2k3 hands down. I don't know why... but it last longer. and Online Play nuff said....Gameplay- 2003 is more casual friendly, which means even if you're not into Basketball you could still find some fun here. And with their innovative Freestyle right joystick control, its deffinitly funner.While 2003 could be funner for a shorter amount of time, 2k3 is the real winner if you took your time for Seasons.... Which one's better is really a matter of taste."
positive,"KICKIN' THE BLUES: This is a top-notch CD, packed full of Thackery's amazing guitar work. I have been a long-time fan of Jimmy Thackery, I own all his solos CDs and over a dozen NightHawks. To finally come out with a instrumental CD is great !! I have all the songs, except the three new ones, but it is still great to have in one package. The last three songs, which take place live at Sulleys, and last over twenty minutes, is the best part of the CD. I was fortunate to be at the small club when it was recorded, and these excellent grooves of ""Rude Mood"" and ""Detroit Boogie"", along with the already released, ""Edward's Blues"" make in plainly obvious that there is nobody better than Jimmy Thackery and the Drivers when it comes to kickin' out some tasty rockin' blues grooves. This is really a great disc, I highly recommend it, even if you do have all his others."
negative,"Have any of you who said this was good seen Blue Max?: Obviously by all the 5 star reviews who think the dogfight seens are great have never seen the Blue Max. This is what WWI airplanes flew like, not the cartoon in Flyboys. The only disapointment in the Blue Max is George Peppard is not german. Don't buy flyboys, watch it on cable."
positive,Don't want coffe without this!: I discovered this product a few years ago. Now I can enjoy the Hazelnut flavor without having to brew a whole pot.
negative,"The worst movie I have seen in years: I ordered the original French version of this movie and got this version instead, due to the supplier's mistake. I watched it nonetheless and it was a horrible, painful experience.The screenplay is absolutely rubbish and the comedic timing is ridiculously bad. The skits, humour and jokes are SOOOOO formulaic, that you would have to deliver the lines to perfection for them to work, but Fellon and Latifah fail miserably.If not for Giselle Bundchen this film would not even be worthy of 1 star! Save your money and rent/buy the French version which is a cult classic."
negative,"NON-anamorphic picture: So disappointing! I thought this would FINALLY be the anamorphic dvd we've been waiting for, but... NO! Strange that so many ""different"" versions of this film have been released on dvd without the anamorphic addition. A HUGE amount of dvd buyers now own hd tv's and home theater projectors... the anamorphic aspect of a dvd is of significant importance to us!! I love this movie... what a total shame."
negative,"Great sound, shame about the music: Absolutely spectacular sound, - the cello has warmth and bit and at times the timpani make you want to jump out of your seat. Having said that, thats all there is. The music is bloated, dull, repetitive and uninteresting. Either full of sound and fury, signifying nothing or else moodily quite in pseudo-profound style but signifying just as little. A sonic spectacular, but only if you arent interested in (the) music."
positive,"A Stunning Debut: As soon as I heard ""Absolutely (the story of a girl)"" I was hooked, but I was curious as to how the album could be. I heard a few of my friends mark it off as a great CD, but I wasn't sure that I wanted to spend all that money on a gamble. Luckily for me, I won the CD and had my chance to listen to it. I was amazed that the whole CD seemed to keep churning out the hits with ones such as my favorite song ""So Far Away"" and ""Sometimes"". Check out The Madding Crowd if you like bands such as:(if you haven't heard these bands, you may like them)Dexter Freebish, Vertical Horizon, Everclear and Neve. Great album to add to your collection......no regrets over at my house. Goodluck shopping/browsing everyone!"
positive,"Rent This ""Space"" Tonight: How many of you have, at work, ever had the same minor ""mistake' pointed out by three or more ""supervisors""? How many have been told you have a bad attitude? Do you seek to validate your work-related malaise?If you've ever toiled at a medium-pay, low-mental-stimulation office job or at Friday's or ( as is the case of my assistant) both, you will have a great appreciation of Mike Judge's minor white collar masterpiece.Adding to this viewer's pleasure was the thoroughly enjoyable, Cali-oriented gangsta rap soundtrack."
positive,"Beautiful Ring: This ring is beautiful, stones are set nicely no gaps and smooth, comfortable fit. Believable and can be stacked with other rings."
positive,"Gracias Joan, Gracias Amazon for having this super album.: Joan Baez at her best - standing up for those without words. Her Spanish album was thrilling when it was released. I would hope that it will be re-released for this generation to enjoy."
positive,Exciting: I purchased this for my 11 year old son and he enjoyed reading it. It definitely kept his interest and he looked forward to reading time.
negative,"Piece of junk: After a year of use, this thing is wack... Doesn't make a full cup of coffee and I have spent around 15 hours screwing around with this thing to no avail. I am going back to my Walmart 25 dollar Mr Coffee tomorrow morning and I definitely will not look back or miss this overpriced piece of garbage!!!! I wouldn't waste your money on this unless you like a 180 dollar paperweight. I had my old coffee maker for 8 years and it only cost 30 bucks... Wish i would've kept it instead of giving it away... Then I could have just punted this POS Keurig out the door!!!"
negative,"WARNING! Sony wants to trash your PC: Do NOT purchase this, or any other Sony CD which Amazon has helpfully marked ""CONTENT / COPY PROTECTED"" if you plan to attempt to play this back (let alone rip a copy) on your Windows computer.See the customer reviews for the Van Zant Brothers CD here on Amazon, or search for David Berlind's blog entry from November 1 on ZDNet and Molly Wood's November 3 column on CNet for more details.One more thing: If you're reading this too late, do NOT try to remove this malware yourself, unless you are extremely tech savvy. It will kill your CD drive."
positive,"Desvio has Arrived!: Young, Fresh and Strong Talent here! From start to finish this album carries lots of energy. Tracks ""En Mis Brazos"" & ""Si Me Dejas"" are guaranteed hits. Whether you appreciate musica latina and/or enjoy good music you cannot go wrong with this album. I am anticipating these melodies to hit the clubs and car tunes soon!"
positive,Not for the faint of heart: Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon as well as the other actors had you sitting on the edge of your seat. great actors and great acting.
positive,"Great sound from a new band: Nine Days presents a refreshing sound to the often drab pop genre. The song ""Absolutely (Story of a Girl)"" was what attracted me to this CD. The song has a good beat, as does the rest of the album. I hope Nine Days releases lots more of the great songs on this CD as singles. A definate plus to the Madding Crowd is that it is explicit lyric free, and has a good messege."
negative,"Fleetwood Mac Rumours: If you want to hear music, don't purchase this video. Each song is quickly interrupted with current interviews of band members talking mostly of their failed romantic relationships during the recording of Rumours. This should be labeled a documentary, not a music video. The band members do talk about the music, and there are nice clips shot at Sausalito, California's Record Plant showing how particular tracks were mixed. However, I believe using the Rumours album cover on the video packaging deceptively implies that it is a music video."
negative,"I was expecting something else.: I thought it was going to be THE PRODUCT that I wanted. But it wasn't. I bought it to get rid of my blackheads, but it doesn't do anything."
positive,"Great Movie, Good Transfer: There were some points at the beginning of the film where there was noticeable grain to the transfer that didn't really distract from the film, but otherwise it's crystal clear and the HD Transfer was done well.Audio tracks sound great, nice and clear, far from flat."
negative,"Think About This: There are over 100 reviews already here, so I won't go over the same old stuff. Every true King fan might want to ponder this idea for a moment - doesn't it seem as if King has lost touch with ""real people"" as his fame has grown? His early books were great, but as he has grown older and richer, his fame may be causing him to lose touch with reality as the rest of us ""worker bees"" see it, and his writing has suffered from it. He's tucked away in a mansion in a small town in Maine, with not much exposure to the outside world. Also, Stephen knows, and so do we, that anything he writes will become a bestseller. So he doesn't have to really worry about pleasing the reader anymore - he knows it will sell a trillion copies and he'll get even richer. I will continue to read his books, but I'll get them from the library - I'm not paying a cent for these crummy stories anymore."
positive,Great CD: I bought this cd for the song 'I hope you dance'. I ended up loving the entire cd. It's worth every penny I spent on it.
negative,"Good concept but Needs Work: Their basic design is good but could be inproved upon easily. We have spent more in batteries for this toy than what it sells for. I guess rechargable batteries would be best. It is cute, but our son doesnt really care for it as much as the one that had lights shine on the ceiling."
negative,"It smoked!!!!!: When I received this item, I plugged it in and smoke immediately began to pour out of the base. I left it for a moment or two, thinking that it may have just been a build up of dust or plastic residue (or whatever) burning off on the first use.After 30 - 40 seconds, the smoke was billowing out even more heavily and I detected a increasing burning smell.At that point I unplugged the thing rather than leaving it to (possibly) burst into flames!So, for me, this item was a TOTAL waste of money - and not worth the postal costs of returning it."
negative,Review: Not very interesting. It was confusing with sailor slang words and British spelling. I would not recommend this book to people who like action.
positive,"Kylie takes a bite at subtlety....: Kylie Minogue isn't a very subtle performer - she's famous for hi-NRG floorfillers, not purring ballads. A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare but with Kylie, it's a dream and CHOCOLATE is a perfect example of it. Sweet and slow, it flows like its namesake throughout, with a catchy chorus that will for sure melt her fans down. Remixed for release, this CD also includes the funky CITY GAMES, two remixes (the EMO mix is the better one) and a live track, taken from her BODY LANGUAGE LIVE DVD, which should receive a late 2004 release in the USA."
positive,A great book for up and coming chefs: I am currently in school for my bachelors in culinary and this book is a must have for all students i believe i have only started to read it but so far it is great
positive,"Witty, clever and a great romantic Regency!: Enochs books are not quite the depth of character as a Stephanie Lauren or Gaelen Foley - more light hearted and fun. Still this was a good read and kept my interest throughout with lots of great dialog and enough romance to keep a romantic like myself interested. Rafe was the perfect hero, a rake with a heart. And maybe not so much a rake as a man who truly needed a home and a purpose in life. Felicity gave him both - a reason to reform and a wonderful woman to love. You will not be disappointed in this book."
negative,"Ugly Movie: People who claim they ""loved"" this gratuitous violence and debauchery-filled movie need to get a life and learn what a great movie is. There is nothing redeeming or ""important"" about this movie. It's just ugly."
negative,"Shoddy Disks: The shows (and Julia) are great. 5 stars for them but the disk was defective from the manufacturer and would not play segment 2 (Decorative Loaves). First disk would freeze up and shut down the entire disk (as if stop button were pressed). Exchanged it and had the same problem with the second one. These shows deserve a much better presentation than this manufacturer was willing to give it. Great show, but lousy DVD mastering job."
positive,terrific little laser printer and at a cheap price!: I had been tipped off by a professional friend of mine that he has 5 of these HP 1020s in use in his accounting business. He claims other printers have failed him but this model has withstood heavy use. That was sufficient recommendation for me - but you know what? He is correct! I'm quite happy with mine and rate it high for quality and value!
negative,"No lessons learned: This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.The book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology."
positive,The AAMT Book of Style for Medical Transcription: The book & CD set came in a timely manner and I'm sure will be used a lot in my business as a medical transcriptionist. Thanks.
positive,"The Best: K&N is the best, I use them in all my toys. Economical over the long haul, maximum protection from dirt, especially here in Arizona where its always dusty and dry. Gotta have an air filter so might as well get the best..."
negative,"You cannot fathom C.S. Lewis; he has no depth.: I'm not a Neitsche fan, but I paraphrase him above since it certainly applies here. C.S. Lewis gives a prosaic overview of why he chose to be a Christian. In lieu of honest inquiry he proffers flowery postulates with barely a hint of evidence. This is not a bad book if you're looking for a plausible excuse to be religious; but if you're not afraid to take a closer look at Christianity, read something like Dan Barker's ""Losing Faith in Faith"". Or, for a closer look at religion in general, read Campbell's four-book series entitled ""The Masks of God""."
negative,"Let down in literature: All endings of his short stories are exactly the same. I feel like I'm reading the same story over and over. After you have read one of his stories you have read them all. It is very boring to read his books and I do not enjoy them. All the plots are predictable, which takes the suspense out of the mystery."
positive,"Brillent! Exellent! the best alblum, ever!: if you love garbage this is the one to have.GREAT songs such as ""i think i'm paranoid"",special,""when i grow up"" and push it.this is a deffenet one to get.if it's $16.00 or E16.00 or whatever it costs. version 2.0 is an essentail alblum.so go and buy it and add it to your collection."
negative,"Of Mice and Men: Of Mice and MenOf Mice and Men was a good book, I recommend it to anyone who likes a good short book. It's full of fun and adventure. But it had its ups and downs. It is not a bad book, I think that I would read it again, but not for a while, I would like to watch the movie first so I can compare if it is even close to how the book goes. I only like one character and that's Lennie, he is very funny at some points, and sad at other points in the book. Over all it was a good book to read if you like to read books."
positive,Real easy upgrade.: This product is really working as what is said in the ads. Upgrading my laptop hard drive was very easy just following simple instructions.
negative,"BORING: This CD is totally boring, even when ""Penny Lane"" comes along to ""pick things up"", 'cause by the time ""Penny Lane"" comes along, I'm already so down and out b/c of how boring the previous tracks are, ""Penny Lane"" just isn't much; I like music from all decades and the '60's is no exception. But what the heck is so great about this CD? Nothing."
negative,"Try it before you buy a large quantity: I bought three boxes of the Kettle Korn (""Slightly Swee & Slightly Salty"") flavor at my local grocery store. Nobody in my family likes this flavor at all. It's actually going into the trash, that's how bad it tastes.Our tastes may be different than yours, so go ahead and try it. Just don't buy a lot of it without trying it first."
positive,"The Unbelieveable Genius of Philip Kaufman: A glorious acheivment in the history of American Film. Passionately directed and gorgeously photographed, with impeccable acting from Day-Lewis, Binoche and Olin. ""Unbearable"" will linger in your head for weeks after watching it. And it's one of the few movies to use animal death in a non-cheap fashion: The death of Tomas and Tereza's dog is riveting and beautifully performed. Contrary to some opinions, the book is not better than the film; it's an entirely different entity structured in a seemingly unfilmable, non-linear fashion. As a written story, it doesn't make the kind of dramatic sense it does on screen. What Kaufman pulls off with ""Unbearable"" is truly remarkable."
positive,Converse Rule: The Chuck Taylor converse I ordered from AMAZON meet all my expectations.It is comfortable on my feet and i wear it everyday.
positive,"Exquisite: I Robot is the top dog of futuristic movies! With technology past we now but allows we to know such, the future!"
positive,Inspiring and heartbreaking... very emotional: I have read the novel Run Baby Run 3 or more times and it has really moved me and I recommend this book to all my friends and my boyfriend. It is amazing how God can change someones life so dramatically. I would love to go to one of Nicky Cruz's ministries sometime in the future and actually meet the man who has made a dramastic change in my life.
positive,Informative and enjoyable: Excellent and detailed account of the Jagdflieger aces and the war which they fought in the skies over Europe. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about this incredible TRUE story.
positive,"Pampers are better than any other brand!: I've tried various diaper brands. Pampers beats all of them hands-down. Well worth the miniscule higher price. With other brands, I experienced significantly more leaks/blowouts up the back. Also, they leaked pee around the waistband area. I've never had the leak problem with Pampers. Pampers aren't perfect, but I have far fewer out-and-up-the-back leaks with them and they feel and look like nice, high-quality diapers. The ONLY thing I don't like about them is the ill-placed color pattern at the inner thighs and upper back areas, as it appears at a quick glance that poo is seeping out when it's not! Gets me almost every time!"
positive,"A wonderful story of early man.: I was introduced to this book this summer by my aunt. She recommended it as one of her favourites. So, I decided to give it a try. I found the beginning a little slow moving. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The story is starts at the begging of man and is based on the evolution of man. Ayla, the main character is left to die because her clan was killed in an earthquake. She is adopted by a passing clan and brought to live with them. The story deals with her acceptance into a very different community. She is cast as an outcast from her clan because she is different. In fact she is one step above them on the evolution scale. In the end she is exiled from the only family she has ever known and goes on to search for people like her. I enjoyed this book alot,especially learning about different plants and their many uses. Jean M. Auel wrote a wonderful book and I can't wait to read the rest of the series."
positive,"Cat lovers and supernatural lovers will enjoy this book!: This book was sooo exciting. I couldn't put it down. It almost made me believe it was real . . . that a cat could actually come back from the grave! The characters were really interesting and realistic, especially Sarah's brothers. Anyone who likes the supernatural (and who doesn't) wil love this book."
negative,"Shrinkage: These sheets look as pictured. Following directions to wash prior to using, the flat sheet shrunk to 72"" wide; it is now twin size. Because of the deep pockets in the fitted sheet, it still fits a double bed. They are usable, but barely.Also, since the weight is given in metric, ""heavyweight"" is a misnomer."
positive,"one of ""THE BEST OF THE BEST"" ...: Was that even a Van Damme film ? ... oh well , that's how I would discribe this Van Damme film .Great sets , Great locations , Great costumes , Great props , ok acting ... this is Van damme after all !The only 2 things I could complain about is the fact that Van Damme was a little bit cheesy about being proud to be a LEGIONAIRE and the ending ( I wont spoil it) .... it just seemed prodictable to me .All in all , this is a good film and I recommend this as one of the best Van Damme films ."
positive,One of my favorite books from childhood: A magical tale of enchantment...I first found this book in the public library when I was nine years old and fell in love with it. Years later I was able to check out this very same copy long enough to read it to my older two children. Now I am longing to read it to my younger children and have discovered that it is no longer available. Please contact the publisher and bring it back!
negative,"Not impressed: I bought this, but I have yet to watch the entire DVD. I had hoped that it would be an easy step-by-step, but that was not the case. I am not sure if I should have understood this before purchase, but the part I watched was very new age spirituality and very little actual forms. It did not hold my attention at all."
negative,"LET'S NOT FLASH TOO MUCH JUDAISM AROUND: Interestingly, the author is trying to push the US born jewish people in a sort of a JEWISH MAFIA.Let's be modest and treat all other religions and people as equal.Otherwise bad things will happen to us.The world and its people are not stupid to notice how disciminating and radical a lot of the Orthodox Jews have been towards others.There is a difference between Isreali Jews and US born ones like me.I do not feel that I should promote my Jewish brother, just becouse he is Jewish. I would promote the best person for the task. America has given us so much more than Isreal and I believe that we shall be gratefull and supportive of its people.May all religions and people trive and be equal!!!"
positive,Hilarious: My wife and I don't even have any kids yet and we watch this show all the time. It is really clever and funny and has become one of our favorite shows.
negative,Doesn't work for long: I purchased this model in March 2002 and in May 2003 - it just quit working! I thought the battery had run out - recharged it -nothing! Bought a new battery - still nothing. All it'll do now is make a click noise when you switch to camera or vcr. Cant even get my tape out of the damn thing now! Call Panasonic - what a joke! They wanted $149.00 for a diagnostic test and $102.00 service charge - I only paid about $300 for it new. I'll never buy another panasonic again - the service was terrible and they are not helpful AT ALL! Good luck if you buy one - get the extended warranty! They should sell them for $50.00 and just make them disposable!
negative,"Sizing is Ridiculous: I measure as a Small and the Small and Medium did NOT fit. Update: I ordered a Large and wore it for 2 days and it stretched too much. I am not sure this will help, but I have worn the item so I cannot return the Large. I am not any smaller than when I began so the Large did stretch and did not shrink my waist and/or hips."
positive,Pampers: I have been using Pampers since my baby was born. They are perfect. I loved the product and i suggest to every mother and father.
positive,"Works Fine...: The epilator works fine and the price says it all. I recommend it for people with not a lot of hair, because it doesn't get all of the hair the first time so you need to repeat again...That's why I gave it four stars not five...Other than that it works okay, I don't have to shave every three days anymore."
positive,"Life Changing: My Dad read this book to me growing up. I feel there is more said even in the front picture of the forest going into the horizon than in almost any other work I have ever read. I give it an 11. A fool may not get it, but if you let the book do it's thing, you are changed."
positive,"This IS Hardcore Punk: i've been a part of the punk and harcore scene for 15 years now. this documentary is just what every newcommer needs to see. its a great door into what started it all. i highly recommend this to anyone intersted in understanding where your favorite band came from. my only negative thought is that the movie ends abruptly. after 1985 there were a few more inmportant hardcore bands but they are not mentioned i dont believe the scene just ""died off"". this movie obviously focuses on the history of hardcore but it would have been nice to see how some of the second generation bands came about. overall, i loved it!"
positive,Rod still has IT: Rod still has it. He sounds good as ever. This is the kind of stuff he does best. Welcome back. Nice cover.
positive,"Best Bible Story Book ever: Elsie Egermeier's retelling is simple and direct. Growing-up I learned the scope and sequence of the Bible as Egermeier's was read front to back again and again. She included most all of the stories and told them without sentiment or apology. Adults will find this a great way to read through the Bible for themselves. Families and teachers will find it a reliable resource for children, youth, and adults.I wish it were in print."
negative,"Don't waste money: The book has two parts - first half is without obvious purpose that makes reader pretty much tired to read any further. Once you do that you are faced with examples that one can find on the web, no explanation of Perl code as if we are expected to know that already."
positive,"One of the greatest horror movies, ever, if not the best.: One of the greatest horror movies of all time. Maybe the best. Deep in the hart of Texas with a family of Ed Geins! If you love to eat meat, try seeing it from the other end. Great diection, cimemetography, characters, music, imagery, and story. A great bloodbath to behold! The bonus features are documentaries and commentary. Dig it!"
positive,great little book case: I love this bookcase. it's just the right size for the kid and it rids of some clutter. the only downside is that the taller books on the top shelf have a tendency to occasionally fall forward.
positive,"Stable and fast!: I am using this card on my new PC that I just built. I bought this as a cheap alternative to a USB type card. I must say, I will never do USB again. Strong signal and NO dropouts. Works great on my 64-bit system. There are no cons to this card. Buy it while it is still available. Other sites are out of stock!!!!"
positive,DVD Release: For several years I have been constantly checking to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet. Who do we even contact to put in the request?!? I would love this movie on DVD!!!!
negative,"Waste of money - Caveat Emptor: My computer would not recognize this upgrade kit with my Western Digital 250 gig PATA notebook drive.It showed up on my doorstep on Friday night, but by the time I realized I could not make it work by following the instructions, the west coast tech support closed for the weekend. I was persistent and surfed the web to find some help, and I found some of the other reviewers had the same problem as me.Frustrated on Saturday morning, I ran to my local computer store (Kaplan) and bought ANOTHER hard drive upgrade kit, but a different brand for 40 more bucks. The second hard drive kit I bought had a power cord and a USB cord, and it worked!(The apricorn unit only had a usb cable, but funny enough they list a power cable on their website as a recommended accessory)I would say buyer beware, unless you want to waste 40 bucks like me."
negative,Not what I expected: The story was not what I expected it to be. Not really appropriate for a young child. I would not buy it again.
negative,"Read a biography: I must agree with all of the previous reviwers who acknowlegde that Franklin is a facisnating man and played a major role in the creation of this nation, but you would never know from this book. It completely ignores his affect on the Declaration of Independence, his influence on American thinking, and most of his key inventions are skimmed over in a sentance or two. His writing style is certainly antiquated (which is understandable) but it makes it a difficult read, especially since it is boring to begin with. I think it would be a much better plan to read a biography by someone else who read through this book, save yourself the agony of getting through this story and learn more about the man then you do here."
positive,"A good education: I got this book today and I opened it and I couldent stop reading it, I read it today from front to back and now I am so amazed by this book that I am writing a review in the same day that I got the book in the mail, read it and now I am writing this in the same day! We are brought up to beleive these things about women which are simply not true! If we take the time out to understand women and look at them from a scientific realistic perspective which is not through society or religion, then we see the truth about women. Once we understand women and our role, we understand God. The truth about women in today's religous eyes is looked at as terrible, but the truth is the truth, if we dont understand women then how can we understand God, A man that calls this science foolish and devilish is a liveing breathing walking devil. A man who understands women is wise, look at king Soloman he understood women and he was called the wisest king ever."
positive,"A great bike for the price I paid...: I bought two of these bikes, before Christmas and when they were selling for one-fifty, which was an awesome price for an awesome bike. The bikes were relatively easy to put together - you have to install the handle-bars, seat post and seat, from wheel and the front disk brake (the only really tricky part), and it took me about an hour. Everything else is pre-assembled, and that is done very well too.The quality of the bike is just great - everything feels really solid and well-built. My only complaint is that for an all-aluminum frame they are surprisingly heavy, so even with the 21 speeds this is not a good bike for anyone living in a particularly hilly area.But even at two-fifty, these bikes are half the price of comparable comfort bikes at your local bike shop, and you can't even find comfort bikes with disk brakes from what I can see, so that makes the deal for me."
positive,"Hitchcock Does it Again: When Alfred Hithcock makes a movie, you know that it will be good. He has a knack for putting ordinary people in deadly situations. This film is no different. Meet a couple on a vacation they may end up taking the ultimate relaxing sleep- in a coffin. Rich and Strange. A film that will chill you to the bone with it's spectacular acting."
positive,"Dreaming of You: The main reason to get this CD is because it contains that ""other"" Diana Ross / Lionel Richie duet -- ""Dreaming of You."" It's a fun Motown song and only for that reason I give the whole soundtrack 4 stars. Okay, it's fun to hear KISS sing Disco (around this time Gene Simons & Diana Ross were an item), but the soundtrack could have been a bit more exciting. Ross makes it worthwhile though (if you like the song Endless Love, check out Ross's solo version of the song on Why Do Fools Fall In Love)."
negative,It feeds the Western stereotypes of India: This is another novel in the genre of the Macaulayite Indian trying his/her best to describe India to the West. The problem is that the synthesis is wanting because the author's understanding is based on stereotypes that muddle where a straighter look would have shown reality for what it is.
positive,Air Purifier: So far the air filter has exceeded my expections..The purchaing experience through Amazon was great.. Godd service...Good product
negative,"Good job Courtney...: Releasing a Box set, then a year later releasing a CD containing mostly Box Set songs and then three new ones, hoping the hardcore fans will buy both to get the full list of songs. It's a shame.She said she is bringing Francis Bean into the ""family business""- the family business of milking all the money you can of your husband's music? That's low Courtney, even for you."
positive,"I would put 10 stars if they would let me!: WOW is all I can say. What an intense movie, it's 2+ hour time just zooms by as you are entranced in a tale of fame and glory. I don't care what any critics say, this is a must own for DVD and movie fans. Crowe is amazing as Maximus. One of the best DVDs ever IMHO."
positive,"good quality, good price: I ordered these for a poker game i had set up in Advance, they arrived on time and i was impressed with the quality for the money, great set for a hobby poker player!"
negative,"Ponderous: This novel has been inexplicably compared to Nicholas Monsarrat's post WWII naval classic, ""The Cruel Sea"". Although a fan of MacLean's I could not get beyond the first 65 pages."
negative,"""The Postman rings once"": This book left me with a feeling of sadness and without sympathy for the main character.Too much wallowing in self pity for me.I also was surprised by the mistakes in grammer, spelling, etc., either made by the author or missed by the editor.I wouldn't recommend this book to any of my friends.We live about 5 miles from Bodega Bay, and I enjoyed reading about the town."
negative,"17 years old and it shows: Well, I might have agreed with the other reviewers if I hadn't ordered ""Strength Ball Training"" by Goldenberg and Twist at the same time. This book seems very amateurish by today's standards. It's a thin paperback with hand-drawn sketches. Maybe this was considered okay back in 1991, but this is 2008. SBT gives you all of the exercises in this book plus many more, updated with recent training science background, illustrated with photographs of actual people, plus a DVD with videos illustrating many of the exercises! And it's the same price! Come on, get into this century. Amateur productions like this one just don't cut it anymore."
negative,"Boring and unscientific: Unscientific? You are probably wondering how I could say such a thing. I could easily get through the heavy philosophysing via the Trevize & Bliss arguments, but when you get right down to it, Asimov just took the ""Future is bliss through the oneness/Gaia/connectedness"" (pick a mechanism) option. Ho-hum. Really, I expected a better ending to this grand series."
negative,"Nice texture, bad smell: I was so excited to receive the mat. It looks really nice and has a nice texture. I like the length of it being a few inches more than the standard size. I can't wait to use it. But little did I know, it has a very strong yucky smell, in some way worse standard yoga mats. I washed it with soap and water and laid it flat in the garage to air it out. It's been three days, the smell seems to fade a little but it's still not usable. My other yoga mats took only a couple of days for the smell to fade away.Update:It's been more than a month since I received the mat. It still has that light rubbery smell. I had it out in the sun several times but I can't seem to get rid of the smell. Other than that, I do like the mat. It has a nice texture and provides good traction."
negative,"Dont' Buy: Can be knocked off the suction cup and if it falls will break.DON""T Buy - at some point the suction cup or it will get knocked down and then break into 100 pieces"
positive,"Great Book, Especially the Apache SOAP Integration: I really got a lot out of this book. It covers many of the more useful Tomcat subjects. There is a focus on the use of Tomcat as it relates to the developer, but that is what I am so it was perfect for me.One of the more useful chapters was the chapter covering Tomcat and the Apache SOAP project.Great Book James."
negative,"Removal of the movie?!: This was a great movie in the theatre, even though they left out about 30% of the book. My biggest beef with this Widescreen edition is the fact that they took out ANOTHER hour of the movie!! The DVD case states that the movie is 159 minutes. Well the credits end at closer to 99 minutes. The DVD case also states that the special features are not rated or closed captioned. There ARE no special features!!This is a terrible knockoff of the movie. My wife is on her way to take it back to the store so we can try and get the deluxe 2-disk edition in the hopes that they actually had the whole movie. I don't see why you would waste a dual-layer DVD with 99 minutes of content and 0 special features. Sad. Very sad."
negative,"Absolute Kitsch: This is horrible music. This so-called musician poisons the instruments played here and commercializes them in a horrible way. No doubt out to make money, not true music. Uninspired and soulless!"
negative,"good price, bad quality: I buy these diapers through subscribe and save, so they come out at reasonable price. BUT the quality is not good enough. My daughter is a pretty good pooper and these diapers spil all the time! I have to change her clothes or wash sheets and mattress cover every day! The money I save on diapers i spend on detergent, energy and water.Huggies are so much better!"
positive,"OH EM GEEEEEE: this movie is amazing....i actually bought it a while ago. i think EVERYONE needs to see this. dont call yourself punk unless you've seen this film. i would give it 49735847598074867089567958670467 stars.have fun, kids."
negative,Not a very good movie: I am thoroughly disappointed with this flick. I thought I was renting a movie that would have me laughing. Instead I was treated to whole lot of mind numbingly stupid banter between two guys whose names I cannot remember and will not remember because their sum of charisma and acting ability are so incredibly lacking.Go see Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. See Fast Times at Ridgemont High (which this movie tries to emulate). But don't buy or rent this flick. You will be sorry if you do.
negative,"Horrible!: I was very disapointed when I saw this.Knowing Terence Hill was in it I was expecting something a ton better.Big disapointment.Good cast,but bad movie."
positive,"One Great Book: Eragon is an excellent book that I would recomend for a teenaged reader. Young Eragon sets out on a quest to avenge his uncles death with his dragon Saphira and his Teacher Brom. He later travels to the Varden to help them deafeat the evil king. This fantasy takes place in a mythical land during the middle ages. It is a very exciting book with lots of fighting and conflict between the two sides. Based on this Book I expect the sequel Eldest to be excellent. Christopher Paolini did a excellent job on this book especially for a 17 year old writer trying to please kids just younger then him. The advetures of Eragon and his companions are compelling, you won't be able to put this book down until you are done. Eragon will leave you itching to read Eldest; these are 544 pages that you will want to read again and again."
positive,"Cool Album: After hearing this album OVER AND OVER I eventually began to like it and finally purchased it. Although some of the songs are really just mixes of other songs, the art isn't lost. There's alot of creativity to be found here. Enjoy it."
negative,"The inability to think equates to the inability to vote !: This (comic) book tells us much more about the mentality of it's authors and readers then it does about evolution. And more importantly it helps to explain how the Repiblicans could convince a majority of voters to vote for an intellectual midget like G.W. Bush.It is now clear that an American conservative is one who believes that there is proof that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, but that evolution is an unproven fallacy!God (or Darwin) help the United States of America!"
negative,"weird and interesting!: I remember seeing a glimpse of this film a long time ago and didn't think much of it. A month ago, I watched the whole thing for the first time and thought it was interesting. I know Michael Myers wasn't in it and that's ok. But still, John Carpenter produced it and if anybody's a fan of John Carpenter as I am, it should be part of their Carpenter collection or Halloween collection. One of my favorite things about this movie is the music. I thought John Carpenter did a great job. I bought the soundtrack and my favorite tracks are #1-(the main title) and #9-(the rock). I just didn't get the ending of the movie and as far as the dvd, I was disappointed there were no special features, not even a trailer, but at least the picture and sound are great."
negative,"Eragon is cubic zirconia: After hearing this book built up as the next coming of Tolkien, I was disappointed and disturbed to actually read it. It was like being invited to a party and told that there would be an amazing diamond on display, only to find cubic zirconia. There's a little bit of sparkle here and there, but the sparkle is all easily recognizable as having been taken from elsewhere--WHEEL OF TIME, DRAGONRIDERS, and, of course, LOTR. Etc. It's kind of disturbing that so many people seem to be fine with that. I presume that many don't know because they haven't read Robert Jordan etc? What's good about this book is imitation, and what's so-so and even boring about it is the way it's written. Anyway, this is cubic zirconia being passed off as diamonds, and it isn't worth the hype it's been getting."
negative,Miscast Actress Playing Emma Is Too Old!: Anyone who knows the book knows that Emma is susposed to be about 20 years old so why do they have an acress playing her that looks like she's between 40 to 45 years old?Isn't this actress in this 70's BBC made version a little too long in the tooth to be playing a young woman in her early 20's?Buy or rent the Gwyneth Paltrow or Kate Beckensale versions instead. They act good in their versions and are young enough to be believable as Emma.PS: The guy playing Knightley in this movie is too old too.Jeremy Northam and Mark Strong are way better Knightleys.
negative,"Gay Man vs. Crazy World-This Book is Bizarre, Disturbing & Not At All Funny!: The only good thing I can say about this book is that it gave me a lot of strange and scary things to ponder. The author rambles for several chapters, then takes the reader along for his silly interpretation of 'family' life. If only the world were like him, he imagines that everything would be okay. Sedaris is flagrantly self-absorbed and immature. A truly disappointing read."
positive,"Great Cover - if you can get your Bible into it: My wife purchased this Bible cover for me as a birthday present. I had wanted this over anything else since my existing was falling apart. My Bible is a NAS Inductive Study Bible. And it is big Bible. But the XL, the largest cover they make, did not come anywhere close to fitting it. I really like this cover, but if it doesn't fit, it will do you no good."
positive,"Large: What strikes me the most is how roomy this tent is, though it's not possible to stand up straight. It works well for 4 people, though 6 might be too much. I like having a little wiggle rom for getting dressed without stepping on someone.It appears to be waterproof, though I haven't been in a big rainstorm yet, just very wet fog. Zippers work well and I like the color of the tent. The view from the inside ""windows"" is great and makes it airy if needed.The reason why I give it an average+ rating is that it's impossible to set up by myself. Somehow with advances in modern tent design I had expected that I could do it by myself."
negative,"At least they got back together...: Jon Hiseman writes in the booklet: ""If you are looking for <<Son of Valentyne Suite>> you can forget it... those days are long gone, for us, as well as you..."" No kidding! If you loved the rock-jazz of the 70s Colosseum with those trademark fugues you will hate this CD. The sound reminds me of a watered down, boring mix of Blood Sweat and Tears, Steely Dan, and Chicago. Heckstall-Smith is vaguely decent only on a couple of tracks. Don't waste your money on this CD--buy the old ones. The rating is *two* stars instead of one (or zero) as an encouragement to stay together and rediscover their rock-jazz plus classical roots."
positive,"An excellent read!: For all those Diana Gabaldon fans, Sara Donati does not disappoint. Well written and researched, Donati's books are a must read. Her characters are multi-layered and three dimentional, and the plot intricate and captivating, to say nothing of educational. Anyone reading these books will not be disappointed, but especially those with high standards. Into the Wilderness, and Dawn on a Distant Shore kept me burning the midnight oil many a night. I highly reccommend this series, for which there is a third soon to be published. If you want depth, and hate ""fluff"", then these books are for you. Thankyou Ms Donati for giving me something worth reading."
negative,"a disappointing bore: I was so looking forward to this novel - a somewhat trashy page-turner with an interesting historical backdrop. Well, it wasn't a page-turner, and the historical backdrop was so far from believable that I had no interest. It was trashy and truly juvenile. Frankly, I'm shocked that so many people have rated this novel highly. If you want a fun, trashy, historical page-turner, try Anne Rice's ""Cry To Heaven."" That was a guilty pleasure which I loved. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" falls miles short."
positive,"PT's Anesthetize...: Incredible Band !! Incredible performance !! Being a long time PROG fan...Dream Theater, Rush , P Tree, Tool..etc... I love this DVD/Blu-Ray...Looks and sounds great on my new 59"" plasma.. Get it, You won't be disappointed. !! TV not included..sorry.."
negative,"Lepo.....: In Hawaiian, this means Dirty, dirt, or filth, I think this word best describes this album. I bought this album thinking I would hear a wonderful singer and voice, but the only thing I can say is that screaming monkeys at the zoo sound better. All of his songs sound the same, kind of like a broken record. ""Invisible"" and ""I Will Carry You"" sound like the kind of screaming and moaning you'd hear at a mental institution. It seems his music only appeals to 4 to 14 year old girls, who have all the time in the world to sit in front of their computer and pine eternal about Clay's music. Perhaps when most of them grow up, they will realize what a waste of time this guy is. If you want to hear great music....listen to Iz Kamakawio'ole."
negative,"Disappointed and Shocked: I bought the Olivia Body Oil just showed like the picture sevel times in Greece. My wife felt it good. So I want to buy some again.I found it and the picture showed just like the same thing what I wanted. I put my trust in it. I am so disappointed and shocked with what shipped to me! It is not at all like the picture showed me, including the bottle and the something in it. I do not know what happened. I just feel being deceived! If there is zero star I can choose, I will.Sorry for my English."
negative,salt in the wound: This CD has no remnant of what Soundgarden was. Any fan that's mourning the breakup should listen to the old albums and spare themselves this souless pop.
negative,"in no hurry to buy: Sometimes being ""original"" isn't necessarily better. Now don't get me wrong... I love this opera and grew up watching it on tv as did many reviewers.. But I'm not wasting my money on a black and white early tv video. What I am hoping for is a DVD of the wonderful video filmed on location in Israel with Theresa Stratas as the mother. I saw this the first time on PBS circa 1979, and was able to find a video tape produced by VAI. However it is time for a release of that performance on DVD. If I want to hear the original cast, I have the cd of that performance."
negative,"For collectors only!: This CD only contains 2 songs, both of which are available on Madonna's first album. Definately only for those who can't stand not having any given Madonna cd for their expansive collection."
positive,Wonderful japanese comedy series: This is great comedy for adults (for more grown up kids also if allowed with some swearing). Much better than expected. And it has a very fine storyline behind.
positive,Coyote Ugly: I usually dont give reviews of movies becuase everyone else does and it sums up what I have to say but I read the reviews for this movie and was very dissapointed. I went three times to see this moive. It was exectly every time I saw it. I even bought the soundtrack which was wonderful. The movie was Awsome. It shows how you should never give up on anything that you really want -boy or girl- becuase it can be acheived. I belive that everyone should see this movie!!
negative,Fantastic: Every song in the album is wonderful and he has such a beautiful voice. I never tire of listening to it.
negative,"Name I know but....: This thing was a waste of my money.Thought that this item would be a good buy because of the brand since I have a coffee pot that is over 10 years old and has been with me longer than anything I own,but I was wrong.It won't even keep a cup of coffee warm not to even mention hot.Save your money wait till around Christmas time and get one at the dollar stores or someplace."
positive,"Clan of the Cave Bear, a true classic: Novels come and go, in our bookshelves and in our minds. But Clan of the Cave Bear is one with glue that sticks with us forever. I read this book 30 years ago when it was first published, and loved it. Shared it with my friends and family members at the time, who loved it, too. Now that I have a teenage granddaughter, I ordered it so she could enjoy it as well.Jean Auel created a character set in the backdrop of the Neantherthal age who could be (should be) a hero and role model to young girls everywhere. Her journey takes the reader into the hearts and minds of people who lived so long ago, yet the human element of love resounds deeply.Read this book! You won't be able to put it down. It is unlike anything you have ever read before."
positive,"A fascinating and imaginative classic. Do not miss this.: I first read it when I was 12, and still pick it up every 3 years or so to suck it all in again. There are very few books that I honor with a re-read. His characters grab your imagination and stay with you the rest of your life. There's battles, intrigue, politics, big business and even Ornithopters. And to this day I'd give anything to sit astride a racing Sandworm and glide across the vast sandy expanses of Dune World."
positive,a must see movie for everyone: this is surely the most beautiful movie ever made--the director jean cocteau tells the story of beauty and the beast--the film is sheer magic and impossibly beautiful with images of hands holding torches to light hallways --mystical mirrors with images --the beast with his smoking hands and beauty gliding down the hallways of the castle--josette day portrays beauty and gives the character an etherial otherworldly quality--john marius gives an equally strong performance as the beast who falls in love--the first time i saw this movie i missed a lot of the english subtitles because the movie itself was so beautiful to watch i kept forgetting to read the subtitles--my children were equally fascinated by this film but it is very realistic and i don/t recommend it for very small children---watch it yourself first ---a visual treat from start to finish
negative,Generic: I wanted something a little more specific to the African American child in terms of race and self esteem considering the prejudice that my child will have to come to terms with.This book only offered one chapter on that and not a very insightful one.
positive,"This book keeps you turning the pages...: First off, congratulations Mr. Paolini! You certainly wrote a wonderful book!I first picked up Eragon because I liked the way the cover looked. I have never regreted that move, as soon as I finished the first chapter I was sold. He has a way of letting you know just enough that you don't get frustrated, but you are still curoius. He makes you feel as though you are there, the chapter in which he first flies was when I truly noticed how I felt I was riding Saphira, instead of Eragon.I will say this book gets a little slow at parts, a few times you just say ""C'mon! Keep going!"" But it always picks up quickly again. Mr. Paolini makes the whole book seem real, from the way he describes the snow and the mountains, to what is going on in the story I can only say pick it up, you won't be dissapointed."
negative,The Gift that ruined christmas: I got this gift for my daughter.SHe had been talking about wanting to start knitting for weeks.This would be the perfect gift.On Christmas morning she opened the presents and found it.We started on it right away.We spent 2 hours unraviling the skein just to find out it was broken in the middle.The skein is now useless.We never got to make this product and I am returning it.My daughter only wanted something to knit and now shes devastated.Thank youfor ruining my Christmas.I never got to make the scarf and never will. If i were you I would not buy this product it may come broken and then you will have the same problem I do : a ruined holiday.
positive,"GOOD LOOKIN'!!: My girlfriend told me I had to see this movie, that I would love the ""eye candy"". She was right; I could spend much more time watching these girls dance around. But in addition to all that, it ends up being a very entertaining movie - fun characters, fun story, fun music."
negative,"Another Lost Sale: I too was ready to buy this product, but will not do it if I can't get the color I choose. I guess this company doesn't want to put their customers first!"
positive,Life changing book: This book changed my life for the better period. It's a must read book for anyone struggling through this life. I'm in the process of purchasing all of Don Miguel Ruiz's books.
negative,"It's a Mark Twain classic... but I couldn't say why.: Mark Twain is, of course, a famous writer and a producer of a number of US classics. But this one is just too much of Mark Twain trying to make nasty remarks in order to be a cynic and too much of pushing American chauvinism, against too little realism to be bearable. Fine, 19th century Americans (and 20th and 21st as well) believe as a religion that their republic was the best invention since sliced bread and every other country in the history of the world was a land of morons. But this story depends on some far-fetched underestimation of human beings (or overestimation of Americans in relation to all others) in combination with sweeping generalizations and a lot of sweeping history under the rug.In short, I didn't like it."
positive,Cool!: There is nothing more to say other than this is a cool classic clubtune you will never get tired of!!
positive,"If you love Usher, you want!: I wasn't totally in love with the show, but I'm an Usher fan. I feel like the Los Angeles show would have been more banging! I've been dying for Usher to release some sort of concert on Blu-ray. Really wish Confessions or 8701 would get put on Blu-ray. If you are a real Usher fan, this is a must have!"
positive,"Worth your time and very enjoyable historical (biblical) novel: Got this as a free Kindle read and so glad I did. This was one you did not want to put down and felt as if you were there in the scene, as you were drawn into the story. I liked that it was not repetative, as some writers will repeat points already made. The story was fast moving, engaging, and certainly of interest. A true test of any good book is if you want to read the next in the series and I'm there."
negative,not happy: Bought two of these HDMI cables and took one to the cabin to hook up dvd player to tv. The cable didn't work. Don't know if the other one works. I will check when I get home. So far looks like you get what you pay for.
positive,Acts- Build Community: Great discussion in our community group. Confronted (mis)conceptions of the Holy Spirit. Deeper than expected from online book review - much growth for all of us.
positive,"System Of A Down - Toxicity: Good album! I liked this album alot. Good and pretty heavy to my tastes. My favorites are in the top 5. There sinlges like ""Chop Suey"" - This song was decent, good guitars in it. And the other ""Toxicity"", that song was just straight off the hook, drums and guitars were bangin. This whole cd is bangin, I like there whole sound on this album, System Of A Down knows how to make good tracks. Check this album out!!!My Top 5 Songs1.Prison Song2.Shimmy3.Toxicity4.Psycho5.Needles"
negative,"Bizarre side effect: Although my Lasik procedure was a success, the experience left visibly red veins across the whites of my eyes which have not faded even after a year's time. Based on the other reviews here I began taking this supplement at the recommended dose of 3/day hoping that it would reduce the redness in my eyes. Prior to this I had been taking a single fish oil pill/day.While the redness of my eyes did appear visibly reduced over time, I began to experience a baffling side effect where, with my mouth wide open in mid-yawn, my jaw would suddenly and unpredictably ""lock"" open. I had to push and prod the side of my jaw for minutes at a time before things would pop back into realignment and I could close my mouth. For a couple of weeks I had no idea what was happening and was about to go see a doctor before I put two and two together. I immediately ceased taking the supplement and it hasn't happened since.Probably not a typical reaction bit I'll stick to regular (low dosage) fish oil for now."
negative,"Saved by two tracks: Being a big sopranos fan and having watched episode ""join the club"" where Tony is having his dreams while his on the e.r. from a gun wound from his crazed uncle. I heard the brilliant track titled "" when its cold i like to die"" by moby sang by Mimi Goese, who also sang into the blue. Both tracks are wonderfull but i realy hate Mobys techno songs but his slow songs are realy great. Almost the whole album sounds pretty annoying, except for the two slow tunes. Moby stick to your slow songs : )"
positive,"Quick read: Love Langston Hughes' poetry, but this was a nice departure. I would recommend this book to any young person who has not read anything by Langston."
positive,great natural product: this is a great natural cleaner that doesn't affect my chemical sensitivities. no fumes and works well!
negative,"Great up to size 4. Size 5 leaks at night: I'm a Pampers fan! From Swaddlers to Cruisers to Baby Dry. But when my daughter moved up to size 5, the pamper leaks at night. She is a soaking mess in the morning. And the soaking is the particles in the diaper. The diaper literally falls apart. I bought one case and it's is almost finished thankfully. Back to Cruisers we go!"
negative,"A Box Within a Box: This is a bit of a slog because it really is a parody within a parody wrapped in a mystery with Inspector Morse checking in. The mystery is compelling, but little else is in this Dexter work."
negative,An ok book: It was very confusing at some parts. Overall it had a great plot. It is a better reading if you are older.
negative,"Complex image of black life in the early 1900s: This book is not ""Color Purple"" or ""Harlem Nights"": anybody that is trying to read a simple narrative about black lesbians or the Renaissance will not find it here. Muhanji's characters come from various race, gender, and sexuality backgrounds. This book has twists and turns that may surprise those not up for the challenge of this reading. I didn't particularly love this novel, but I do think Muhanji has talent and will go places one day."
negative,"Not up to expectations.: I thought the author would actually REVIEW the outlet malls, not just tell us where they are (you can get that for free on the Internet!) He warns that not all ""outlets"" really offer great bargains -- but you have to check 'em all out yourself to find out which ones do.And guess what -- he says you can get great prices at Sams, KB Toys, and Tuesday Morning. Well, ""duh""."
negative,"Feels so awkward it's not worth it: I thought that I'd love this when I originally saw this in the store, so I asked for one for my birthday. When I finally removed the tags and stuck my hand into it, it felt wrong. When I went to grab my first cookie sheets from the oven, the sheet almost slipped out of my hand. I then re-adjusted, and ended up destroying a cookie.The biggest problem I have with this is that the spacing is fine for the 4 fingers in the hand, but the thumb has nothing but problems. I would much prefer if one size was sized for the 4 fingers, and the other for a single thumb. Otherwise, it is extremely difficult to visualize where the pressure you apply actually goes.My girlfriend picked up on a similar issue in the fact that the thumb side needs to be shorter than the finger side. When I tried again, I noticed that was also a major part of the problem.Even after trying this grabber quite a bit, I find it extremely cumbersome to use."
positive,"Great history: Great history of the1920's, written with short hindsight of the 1930's. Unusual perspectives on modern man. I would recomend this to any history buff."
negative,"This book helps your self esteem!: Personally, I wasn't very impressed. It is a decent adventure story, but it's very predictable and pretty cliche throughout. I will wait and see how the story develops- because it did keep me entertained. I mean, it's not the most original story, but it's a decent eight-hour ride book."
negative,"Terrible. Just terrible.: People must really be desperate these days. Just because pretentious jerks who write bad music reviews for Rolling Stone and Pitchfork say this is good, doesnt mean it'll make you super-cool if you say you like it too. M.I.A. is HORRIBLE."
positive,good movie: The best cartoon ever. No other cartoon even comes close. even beterthan misson imposible!
positive,"Thinking Book (Review written by Muad'Dib): This is a really wierd book. In the beginning it starts out like any country in a war, but later it delves deeper. The world being controlled by three super-powers that (if you read to Goldstein's book) would supposedly, and I agree, would gain absolutly nothing from all this. The are simply trying to use excess junk. Anyways, Orwell did an amazing job on this book, creating several radically new ideas for the time, including creating Newspeak, Big Brother (which was the basis for the show ""Big Brother""), and, the worst, Thoughtcrime. Anyways, this is DEFINATELY not a childs book, so you should keep it out of the hands of anyone ignorant to the world. It makes you think of the present, and the future. If you like Orwell's books you'll LOVE Animal Farm."
positive,Awesome war movie: This is the greatest retelling of the Midway battle in WW2 with more stars in it than i could name!It WAS the turning point of the war and showed that we could dish it out as good as we got!This is one edge of your seat action packed movie and is a classic to not be missed!
positive,"Pop power from 1974: Amazon's review is wrong; this 1974 LP often gets confused with their 1965 LP, mainly because they are both simply titled ""Hollies"". This one is the band's reunion LP with Allan Clarke, and is one of their best from the '70s, with delightful tunes such ""Falling Calling"" and ""Down on the Run"", both featuring harmonica. Why this LP only generated one hit, ""The Air that I Breathe"" is a mystery; everything here is equally commercial-sounding. Unfortunately, the happy atmosphere here was short-lived, as the albums that followed were workmanlike affairs, with a general lack of musical direction. No matter; The Hollies are one of the great pop bands, and this is one of their best moments."
negative,"Seasoned practitioners--don't bother: This book is quite disappointing for those who are knowledgeable in this subject area. One new to the subject might find CE-VI serves as a quick (but weak)overview. In other words, Baldwin never addresses any one of the subject areas with depth. Each book chapter is only a summary of the area it addresses with a few very short case histories inserted. I would suggest all purchase ""Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness"" by Shakuntala Modi."
negative,Unreliable scale: The scale calibrates but then does not weigh accurately from one weighing to the next. I thought this was supposed to be medical grade?!?
negative,"Don't Believe it for a Minute!: I cook as a hobby when my diet and my budget can afford it. I do not believe this book or the blog for one minute! A young woman living over a pizzeria working a full time job would not have the money or the time needed to create an average of TWO complicated and expensive recipes every day for a year. Just one cheesecake costs me about $15.00 and three hours of my time, not to mention blowing my diet. She's invented the whole thing."
positive,"A Different Collection of Early Stuff: This is among the first Ellington CDs I owned, and remains among my favorites. It presents a nice survey of earlier material, with many of his greatest hits as well as some less familiar tunes (i.e., ones you don't find on every collection of early Duke). Ivie Anderson's vocals really shine, especially on ""It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)"". Not every song was destined for greatness, but the lyrics to ""Love is Like a Cigarette"" are a hoot! The sound is decent considering the age of the recordings."
positive,"A Great Flick!: This movie is a real classic liked it as a kid,and even now.Wish more time was spent on the ghosts though.The Part with Martin Milner where he got his was so cool.Kind of a Dumb Father Figure.Get a load of that Telegram Deliverers Face!One of the classic lines in this movie as said by the little boy,'I Just Saw A Man Without A Head'I recommend this movie for Margaret Hamilton and Martin Milner.Pretty Cool Ghoul Sounding Soundtrack also."
negative,"Oooooh LOL {gracious me, hahahaha! hahHAHAHA!}: You know, I simply do not even recall ever watching this bollywood flick. I can't tell you anything about it other than it shows in my records that I indeed purchased this Salaam Namaste DVD~oh goodness.... just remembered. YES! I had checked it out of the library abt one yr. ago and it was one of the most boring movies I ever set my eyes on, so I fell asleep. The high-pitched singing woke me up, so turned it off. The next day was gathering a bunch of DVDs I'd checked out to return them to the local library, however noticed my cat had knocked this dvd onto the floor & it cracked. This is why I purchased this movie, as a REPLACEMENT for the library as I obligated to. No, this movie really sucked. Good choice for insomniacs however."
positive,"The Hobo Philosopher: This is Charles Dickens' version of the poor kid fantasy. This is almost a fable, I would say. This is the kind of story that you hear over and over growing up in poverty. It is almost in the category of Robin Hood, but this is the real thing in the flesh and blood. The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't. I started A Tale of Two Cities a little while ago and I have it on my night stand. I think that I'll get back to it tonight. I don't know who beats Dickens in superb phrasing and style. He is the Master.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:""Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother"""
positive,"My husband's favorite book.: I enjoyed Cannery Row, but my husband loved it. He rarely reads fiction, but now reads everything Steinbeck that he can find. The characters in this novel are wonderfully bright and colorful, and wonderfully they have a happy ending and live again in Steinbeck's sequal Sweet Thursday. A great book to change the mind of someone who thinks they don't like literature."
positive,"Lara croft, angel of darkness: The graphics on this game are really really good.A big downer is the controls, it used to be really easy but now you`ve got no choice but to use the anolog buttons and i hate them!The locations are very detailed and the interaction of friends and enemies is very impressive.But, i`m not sure that it was a good idea to bring in another character.overall, a very good game worth the money, v.good graphics and locations. The only set backs to this game are the controls, and the extra character."
negative,"Just advanced applications: Unfortunately , this version of the famous Hamilton's book contains only the second volume of the entire book (one can see inside the words ""Volume 2"" and ""Book 3"" in it's first pages), so all the basic definitions about quaternions are not present there. Only the more advanced applications of quaternions (the last part of Hamilton's original work) can be found on it. I bought this book and it hadn't a practical use for me, so I had to download the full version from internet, in pdf form, by free, in order to find what I was looking for. Result: I donated this book for our library, perhaps someone have the first part of the original work and can use this book...But I think this is waist of money for most of us..."
negative,Great in theory but constantly clogs: coffee grains get clogged in the water lines and I have to unclog daily....I am on my second machine in a month. Love the idea of the machine but just doesn't work well in reality.....
negative,"Small: I wanted to use this as my desk chairNopeIt was too small and was like I was sitting in the floor.Also, the pump they provide is horrible...pleas to be pumping for another 20 min just to inflate."
negative,"Starts out good, fizzles not even half way through: I tried reading this book after hearing about all the hoopla on Oprah and was dissapointed. The book started out very interesting when it discussed the two mutes who were roommates and friends and then jumped to several other characters in some sort of boarding house... I stopped half way and moved on to something else. The book is not worth buying but maybe a good one to pick up at the local library..."
negative,will return it: Will return it - did not realize it was not in English until Christmas morning when I tried to play it for my son and got message not compatible in this region?
negative,"Not the Better Translation: The Matthew Ward translation is inferior to the translation by Stuart Gilbert. Using the French ""Maman"" does nothing for the reader of English and, in fact, detracts from the quality of the reading experience. Compare the last several lines of the two translations, and you will find Gilbert's much more powerful, even lyrical. When I first read Camus' book, which is my favorite novel, only the Gilbert translation was available, and it blew me away. When the new improved version came out, I read it and tossed it in the trash. Gilbert, however, makes Camus' lines sing with electricity. If you can get the older translation, do so."
positive,"A clever spy thriller: Tom Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt, a member of an elite espionage team headed by Jim Phelps(Jon Voight). What was thought to be a routine survellance assignment goes all wrong and leaves Ethan framed for the death of his team. Desperate to uncover the truth and find the mole he goes on the run. But will Ethan want to believe the truth when he discovers it?This is a clever movie that has it all, plenty of suspence action and a great plot. This is by far superior to the sequel. The director Brian De Palma is a genious and shows it with breathtaking shot after shot. The supporting cast is perfect including Jean Reno and Ving Rhames. This is a movie I can watch over and over. I highly recommended. The film is presented in wide and full screen, DD 5.1 and has a theatrical trailer."
positive,"The Hobbit:A Very Well Deserved Rating: I think that the only way J.R.R. Tolkien could have improved TheHobbit is if there was more about The Battle of Five Armies. I understand it is supposed to be from Bilbo's point of view,but I still think that he could have improved."
positive,"The best investment for a young traveller.: We bought the audiovox for our seven year old for Christmas. She's thrilled and we've already had two pleasant, long trips. Easy to operate, perfect size for a small lap, good sound quality and the picture is excellent. I'm impressed with the battery life, too."
negative,"There is better existentialism to be found.: I feel compelled, on behalf of all of those interested in existentialism, to add my threnodic voice to all the other numerous and predominantly ebullient reviews of Albert Camus' *The Stranger*. As. I have stated in my summary, there is better existentialism to be found. If I wished to be rude, I would say that Albert Camus is just a Dostoyevskiy/Kafka 'wannabe'. I do not so wish it, so I will merely state that this book does not suffice to place him in the same catagory as those masters. If you really enjoyed Stranger, then *Crime and Punishment* will blow you out of the water."
negative,"RUR has not aged well: Steeped in early 20th century morality and Old Testament biblical references, I found this a hard play to like. A lot of the dialog is particularly incredible, and demeaning to scientists and women. Of course, the woman in story is made out to be an airhead who can't possibly understand the issues involved.Certainly unique in its time, it doesn't track into the 21 century. Read Asimov's robot chronicles,, which still hold up very well.I did like the linked TOC and the electronic presentation in genersl..."
positive,"nice and warm: i started to put these slippers on 2 weeks ago, they were bit tight at the beginning, but now are a lot better. very warm and comfortable."
positive,TRULY SCARY - Blu-ray Perfection!: I love a great horror film that can actually make you want to turn the light on or lose sleep after watching it. Every so often a film comes along that accomplishes this and 'The Descent' is a prime example. The film is a departure from the clutter of junk horror films that have been released over the past few years by not merely infiltrating you with just startle scenes. The sheer fear factor of being trapped hundreds of feet below ground with the prospect of death at every turn is simply the cornerstone of the aural terror you feel throughout most of the film.The Blu-ray presentation is immaculate from the reference quality video to the PCM 6.1 lossless audio track that is amazingly immersive. A must see for any horror fan and a 'high recommend' for anyone!
negative,"Complete CRAP!!!: I'm not sure what went wrong with the production of this DVD, but whoever signed off on it as a ""professional, commercial product"" most certainly should be shot. Repeatedly. In the head.This DVD is unwatchable crap that looks like it was recorded using a cellphone camera. For example, anytime the camera points to the lights on stage, the video blows out, meaning that the band mates disappear into a blur of bright yellow. Of course, comparing this DVD's video quality to that of a cellphone's, is an insult to cellphones.It was mentioned in a previous review that this concert was for charity, so if you're feeling charitable and want to waste your money, go ahead and buy the DVD and use it for target practice (a la ""Success Story"") but if you're looking for a good Who concert DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!"
negative,"A work of complete fiction: In a nutshell, this book's basic premise is that the government can create money at will. Therefore, the government should create all the money it wants and make us all rich. It doesn't take a PhD in economics to realize the absurdity of such a hypothesis. Freely printing money at will was tried before in this and other countries amd the results are always disasterous."
positive,"Rock in your shoe.: This music will make some uncomfortable since it occupies an uncatagorizable space. But like a rock in your shoe it will make you jump around. It offers a mix of pleasure and pain, rhythm and harmonics. Any album that rates a ten is too perfect. This one is human yet godly and still a beast. If I want rock I listen to this."
positive,a great season: if you liked the first season then you will love this one even more it brings back the whole cast from the first one for more adventures and surprises
positive,"THE HOBBIT: Filled with action and the fun of dwarves, elves, goblins, the hobbit Bilbo, Gandalf the grey bearded wizard, and the Dragon !!"
negative,"RECEIVED WRONG DVD: I ORDERED ALL THREE ANNE OF GREEN GABLES MOVIES FOR MY DAUGHTER AND FOUND THAT THE CONTINUING STORY, DESPITE BEING LABLED AS SUCH, WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST ANNE DVD. I'M SENDING THIS BACK FOR AN EXCHANGE, HOPING TO RECEIVE THE CORRECT ONE.THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH ANYTHING FROM AMAZON."
positive,"Another of my 'all time favorites': A movie for everyone: like submarines? like aliens? like mystery? like adventure? You've got it! Plus for those of you who are ""softees"" there is also love and sweetness!"
positive,"Golden Fleece is the BEST: Like the other reviewers, I can no longer find this product on grocery shelves. I tried HEB, Target & Walmart and that's about the only choices we have here in Texas. For some reason, periodically, stores stop carrying them. They should not do this, as they are absolutely the best for cleaning tough baked on things, as well as quick swipes before putting dishes in the dish washer. I have been using them for more than 40 years!"
positive,"A favorite: Jude the Obscure is one of my favorite books. I have read it several times, and now I have it on my Kindle to enjoy again."
positive,GREAT GRAPE: Yes the first album is the best but Columbia screwed them up my releasing 5 singles at once!!! Anyway I would have given 5 stars if they had squeezed in Naked if I Want to (from the first album).Still you should buy this now!!!
positive,"Looking for good rock???: So here I was, wanting to buy a good rock cd. Just looking for anything. Then I got to the letter ""G"", and then I noticed GREAT WHITE. Sure I had some of their stuff and it was pretty good. Never been a big big fan of GW but I respected them as a good straight foward rock n roll band. I picked up a copy of ""Can't get there from here"", just as a shot in the dark. I hit the damn target here. This album has truly opened my eyes. From ""Rollin' Stoned"" to ""Hey Mister"", this album rocks. Highlights, to me, are ""In the Tradition"" (beautiful song) and ""Wooden Jesus"" GREAT WHITE will always hold a spot in my cd player. Keep Rockin'!!!!"
negative,"Ordinary novel from overpraised author: My second attempt to like Seymour, as did my first, failed.The reviewers who compare Seymour to LeCarre and Greene surely cannot have read much of either. Seymour is more a writer of thrillers, more Clancy-like,than either LeCarre or Greene. Both of the latter write something very close to literature; Seymour (or Clancy for that matter)never come close to that level. His plots are intriging, even at times exciting, but his people portraits rarely more than caricatures."
negative,"Simply terrible: I gave it a try for pretty much the last year until I ran out of blades that I had pre-purchased. I'm done with this razor and already went back to the M3 Turbo, which in my opinion is the best of all of the gimmicky razors.Two main problems with this razor, it does not feel sharp and just drags along your skin and hair almost pulling them out making it pretty painful to shave. Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other ""detail"" parts of your face comfortably, even with the little mini razor on the front. It just doesn't work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3, in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use."
negative,A very disappointing movie: Its sad that a animation that is clearly made to attract children was made with such rude humor and disrespect towards others. How this animation could be recomended for anyone is beyond me. Shame on you Adam Sandler that your ability is not used for more postive purposes.
positive,"TERK HDTVLP Indoor/Outdoor TV and HDTV Antenna: This antenna is the best off-air HDTV antenna I've ever used because it is the only one that will consistently pick up all of my local HD stations in one position. I can get the following: ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, CW, MyTV, and PBS."
negative,"Not realistic: I was very disappointed with this book. I took 2 books it was ITALY DISCOVERY JOURNAL I turned to and it is the one my kids enjoyed the most. Pat had great insight about how to make your kids part of the experience, they will always remember this trip as with ITALY DISCOVERY JOURNAL they were part of the decisions."
negative,"The Worst Movie Ever!: This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen! The plot was impossible to follow, the action confusing and flashy, and the film editing awful. For example, there is one sequence in which a motorcycle crashes through a chain link fence and the sound effect boingongong is heard, like a spring snapping. Ridiculous! Concept - Terrible, Acting - Worse, Execution - Rollerball looks like it was made in 2 weeks using 2 computers that didnt work. I reccommend that you see this movie, just so you can tell your friends you've seen the worst movie ever made!"
positive,For a British Child: We purchased this book for our grandson who is British. It proved a superb explanation of the colonies with captivating illustrations to acquaint him with his heritage.
positive,"Just Get It. Easy.: A definite upgrade from your old shampoo!!! Makes hair so soft and lucious!!! Helps damage, but don't know about it promoting growth. Trust me, make the switch!!"
positive,"Ferris: This movie is the Ferris Bueller of the working age. Not only are you laughing through the entire movie because you work in an office yourself, but because the movie portrays real people and the idiosyncricies of life. From the hoosier next door to the abused waitress to the fearful office workers soon to be laid off. This is a corporate world and you should go pee before you see this movie because you will laugh so hard you cry."
negative,"it's your choice: Do you always believe what you read. For many, we do. They say, you can't judge a book by its cover, and that is what many people do to the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. To know what they are about, and why you ""fear"" them, you must get to know them. If you feel that this book is true, it may work, or it may not, but pray about it. Mormons aren't bad, no one is. It's only what we say, think and act, that makes people and their religion seem bad. Saying something about other people is a choice that we each have,...""free agency"" and should try to be Christ like in that choice."
positive,"Truly an ""Acquaintance With Darkness"": This a dark and mysterious book about an interesting and unthought of topic. The book makes the characters realistic. It is haunting and morbid. I would suggest this book for anyone who would like a most creative and intersting view on the Civil War."
negative,Don't bother.: Boring. What was I expecting? Something that would give me insight into my own abilities to heal self and others. This didn't do it. Especially since it wasn't in English.
negative,"River Runs Red: Ft Pillow Massacre: This book is listed in the incorrect section as it is pure fantasy!!!!!! I've studied the Ft Pillow incedent for decades and have read accounts from both blue & gray witnesses and never saw anything realted to the so called atrocities mentioned in this piece of sensational fiction!!!!! What a joke!!!!!!!If you are wanting to learn some Tenn. history then save your money on this book. It is a laughable piece of work if it wasn't for the fact that such nut cases as Glenn Beck have featured it in a segment on his conspiracy theory radio show and has passed it off as a legitimate book on history. More proof at why no one should take any of Beck's reports seriously!!!!!Ronny MangrumFranklin, Tenn."
positive,"there's nothing better than this: I was incredibly bored one day, and went snooping around the basement looking for a new book to read. When I found my mom's old tattered copy of Clan of the Cave Bears, I didn't expect much. Oh my goodness, though, Auel is a virtuoso. I cannot wait for the next one!"
negative,"Catholic Christians Beware!: Mackay's anti-Catholic bigotry is well documented, and in this tome he leaves no opportunity to bash the ""Romish Church"" unexploited. I found the instances of anti-Catholicism in the book to be a major distraction from the rest of the content contained therein. In my mind such close-mindedness has a deleterious effect on the author's credibility."
negative,banal and dated: This Hugo award winning novel shows its age. Characters are using slide rules and fingerprints to prove their points. Not to mention the Martians running around Earth and Mars. Very talky not much else going on. Lots of fiction very little science or imagination. More of a character study of a man's blossoming from a self-centered oaf to a world leader. Really a pretty basic fish out of water becomes a hero story. Not a whole lot of literary value here. I consider this book a waste of time. Not even a good escape novel.
negative,"A worthwhile topic but lacking focus and proportion.: Brokaw's thesis is that a generation tested by (a) the Depression, and (b) WWII, rose to the challenge and deserves our respect and admiration. This may be true, but Brokaw does not prove it. His book lacks the kind of rich specificity which would be convincing. For the various people he interviews, he gives us very little on how they survived the Depression. And as the book advances, we get less and less of the particulars of how the subjects experienced the war. The problem may be that there are too many subjects, or interviewees, to be handled with the thoroughness or depth that is finally convincing. At the end, we are left only with the warm feeling that they have survived, and we can all be grateful for that, but not with a sense that we have come finally to know them, especially in their past, and how that past has shaped them, which is, after all, the point of the book."
negative,bad dvd: The box set consists of 3 dvd movies. The second dvd does not work...how can I exchange the bad dvd for a good dvd?
positive,"excellent album.....: Miles is amazing as always. More rock than jazz though for all those who love the classics. Some fast paced changes and movements through a wide range of hard jazz, it totally rocks. Start with Miles in the sky,then In a silent Way, then this album and end with his masterpiece Bitches Brew for the entire progession of one of the most phenomenol talents of our time. Peace"
negative,"There are much better train CDs out there than this!!!: The picture on the front of the CD is very deceiving. It shows a steam engine (an American-type steam engine, as a matter of fact) and there are no sounds of steam in the entire CD. All you hear for 90 percent of the time are slick wheels running on rails -- no engine sounds, no locomotives working hard or switching. In my opinion, this album is not worth the money for steam rail fans. If there had been a picture one of the European (or Asian) electric-powered trains that you hear on this CD, I would have never bought it."
positive,"just got it: nice printer, good DPI. doesn't have the bells and whistles of a more procy printer like color or automatic printing on both sides. It meets everything it claims though."
positive,Back to basics...: Sometimes back to basics is the clearest path towards understanding current realities. It is amazing to me that a book written in 1946 is still so fundamentally relevant.
positive,high school wana be gets popular rock guy: this movie is one of a kind it was very deep and moving high school girl falles hoplessly in love with town rock star who has had every willing girl in town but she changes him then says good bye .
negative,"The most boring Fantasy novel in the whole world!!!!!!!!!!!: Mr. Paolini,I know this is your debut novel but... IT'S EXREMELY BORING!!! Half of the book is Eragon and his dragon, Saphira talking through their minds about the most boring stuff on earth! I was about 3 or 4 hundred pages into the book and I quit! I was FALLING ASLEEP FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!That's really all I have to say about that.Your critic, HECK NO! I'M NOT A FAN!"
positive,"my favorite series!: The book is about a kittypet, or domestic cat, who is named rusty. rusty goes into a clan that is full of adventure. he is a ThunderClan aprrentice and has two new friends,ravenpaw and graypaw. this book is action packed and tons of things you never expect happon in a world where rusty will prove to everyone that he is just as good as everyone else. i am on the 3rd book now and i can't stop reading them. thank you for reading my review. i hope everyone loves this series as much as me!"
negative,"Get ready for standardized test: Horrible product! Too much talking about general stuff. Not enough real tests. Very low level of expertise. it is just ridiculous how people can get published with such book about nothing. Bits and pieces here and there. Please, Amazon, do not sell this book - too little of material for too much money. It's a SHAME!!!!!!!!!"
negative,"SUCKATHON!: This album was terrible. It was as if Chick was talking to his wife and said, ""Hey baby, why don't you sing on my album?"" and she was all like, ""Ok, but I really don't know how to sing."" Don't buy this album. As a beginning Chick fan, I thought that all Chick Corea albums were good. I was dead wrong. After listening to this album, I was downright embarrassed for Chick, because I knew that he would look back on that album years into the future and just frown. Do yourself a favor and buy something better like Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, or even the disco album, Where Have I Known You Before? Spare yourself the humility"
positive,"Great Story: This book failed to capture my attention in school, but having read the first chapter more recently I was immediately hooked and couldn't recommend a greater classical read with a style that is still relevant to today's reader."
positive,"Works Well --- Slightly Heavy: Have had this for just a few days. First impressions are that it is built well, has good performance, and has an ergonomic design. Bagless portion of operation is great. Besides getting to have a visual assessment of all the dust and dirt you vacuum up, its extremely simple to empty the dirt cannister. I love a product where I don't need to read the instructions, and this product definitely falls in to that category --- all aspects of the vacuum's operations are intuitive. My only disappointment with this unit is that its a bit heavier than I would have expected and as such can be a bit difficult to maneuver ... especially in dense pile carpets. On the whole, good value for the money."
negative,Essentials of Business communication by Mary Ellen Guffey: This is a concise version of the book but not the original book. Even i can't return it since there is no return policy. Accidentally i placed 2 books but i didn't find any option to cancel it. Even i tried contacting the sellers but no use.
positive,"May ""The Hot Dog Syndrome"" be with you!: The Hot Dog syndrome was fun to read. It kept me focused on the priorities of operating a successful business. I thought the ""voice"" was talking to me. Reading this book and applying its simple plan will benefit anyone who owns or operates a business. I could not wait to see what the ""voice"" was going to tell me next. I now keep the book handy at my desk to remind myself throughout my work day of its lessons."
negative,"must have got a dud: got it through amazon.only keeps coffee luke warm.old sharper image can warmer cooler died after 4 years,services tomorrow,it blew this mr coffee plate away.can not find that type anywhere.would not recomend this item to anyone.."
positive,The Best Christmas Songs: Bing Crosby's best recording of beautiful Christmas songs for the family. Not well known because he sings of the Christ child and the true meaning of Christmas.
positive,BEAUTIFUL: THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FILMS I EVER SAW. VISUALY STUNNING. IF YOUR A FAN OF GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY DO NOT MISS OUT!!!!!!!!! THIS FILM WON THE OSCAR IN THAT CATEGORY FOR BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY IN 1970.
positive,"Review: The blades work as expected, which is very good. The only problem I have is that the price is too expensive. I am only saving it might be $1.00-$1.50 on going to the local store and getting them there."
negative,"Not all that: I read this paperback years ago and I enjoyed it. But there's nothing about it that warrants even the $28 price tag on the used copies, let alone $150+ on the new ones. Save your money; this is highway robbery."
positive,"Great Movie, Great Cast: This was an amazing movie-with a very tallented cast and great songs. Beyonce Knowles, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Hudson, and Eddie Murphie did a wonderful job playing the members, managers, and lovers of a girls groups loosely based on the Supreams"
negative,"Lackluster: I found this film to be somewhat boring. Though I enjoy comic book movie franchises, Spiderman is my least favorite."
positive,Wonderful: It just helps to have God's word there for you in the area or topic you need to focus on. Very helpful and easy to use.
positive,"Incisive and funny critique of organizational life: I agree with those who find this a superb comedy. And, as with most great comedies, it is so largely because of its extremely incisive and insightful view of contemporary society, in this case of the absurd, boring, oppressive, and meaningless character of much of contemporary life and work as experienced by those who inhabit American corporations and organizations, especially those of a high-tech and bureaucratic character. Thus it is high-quality social criticism in addition to being deeply humorous (as such other great comedies as Modern Times and The Apartment were in their times)."
positive,"Got Me Running: This tea product got me running alright, to the crapper. But it did help loose about 10 lbs, mostly compacted fecal matter. I also feel more energized and feeling alot better. Before taking this product my best friend was a couple of cups of black coffee but since taking this for the last month my craving for coffee and sweets has subsided, however i now have to bulk up on toilet paper. Great product great buy!"
positive,"A great ride on: honestly, I thought this was awful as a walker. with hardwood floors, this moves much too fast to be stable. as a ride on, however, it is two thumbs way up. My 2 year old is unusually big and tall, but he has loved this so much as a little ride on scooter. it plays a very cute little tune and is quite durable. we have had it nearly two years and have only replaced the batteries once. a great buy as a ride on."
positive,"Don't expect it to ship in 24 hours!: I ordered this 3 weeks ago and it still hasn't shipped, so don't expect to have it in your hands anytime soon. Just so you know..."
positive,Sony basic Hi8 Handycam Rocks!: Performance is outstanding. I had a previous Sony 8 mm Handycam which died and I replaced it with this camera so I could continue to playback my old 8 mm tapes. This camera performs faster and is simpler to use than my old Sony. It does everything I need and does it well... I got a great deal.
negative,different from picture shown: Product recieved doesn't look nothing like the photo shown. It's full nylon and the quick link doesn't even fit on the chain. It doesn't even come close to fitting.
positive,"Fun for all ages!: We bought this game for our 5 year old daughter for Christmas not knowing anything about it. It has become a favorite of ours ever since. We have given it as a gift on several occasions. It's easy enough for a mature 2 year old to play and fun enough for a group of 9 year olds as well. We take it on vacations and to parties, even while we waited for a table at a restaurant. It's unpredictable and changes every time you play it. Just when you think you lost, you could be the winner in the end. Each game is just the right amount of time, not too long for younger players, and not too short for the others. I highly recommend this game as a fun, fast-paced activity for your family."
negative,"Poor build quality - too bad.: I've owned a pair of QC2's for about a year now, and after about 6 months they started making an annoying squeaking noise if I wore them while walking. Then this morning, I went to put them on my head, and the headband cracked, making them pretty much useless.I've had $50 headphones built much more solidly than these."
positive,Several good tips.: There are several good tips here but some are outdated since it deals with film and developing. But still you can get some inspiration here.
positive,Mosby's Medical Dictionary: This dictionary is a great resource. It is full of wonderful color pictures and are very interesting. This book has helped me in many of my classes this semester.
positive,"inspirational when one's in a book slump: i fell in an anti-reading mood for a while in 8th grade, but a lot of people encouraged me to read because it really helps in writing. i went to the library 3 days ago and copied down some titles that incoming freshmen were required to read before fall. ""a tree in brooklyn"" was the first one on the list that still had plenty of copies on the shelves (i think the thickness discouraged some people). i opened it up that night and started reading; it's really interesting! some mysteries of life (some basic things like laughing in a new environment) are explained and in such a way so it isn't boring at all."
negative,"Who knows what this is?: I bought this thinking it was a band with free jazz reed man, Peter Brotzmann. I was surprised that only two pieces feature him and the rest are Scandinavian polkas. This is the strangest thing. A polka after Brotzmann is enough to jar you for a long time.I returned mine for a refund."
positive,"Watch this series: I wasn't interested in birds when I recieved this series as a gift. But it is so remarkably well done that I'd recommend it to anyone, bird lover or not.Attenborough's talent is to present fairly detailed information in a very interesting fashion. He doesn't fail us in this series...the photography is remarkable as well.Perhaps the most remarkable footage is of a bird that does a convincing imitation of a camera shutter, a car alarm, and a chainsaw. You must see and hear to believe."
positive,"A very well done sequel!: We bought this DVD[ASIN:B00005JPH2 The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian] right before the holidays. So far, my family has watched at least half a dozen times. On one of our 7 hours drive to a ski resort, my kids (13 and 12 yrs old) watched both of the Narnia DVD (White Witch and Prince Caspian) back to back. They really liked both DVDs, though my daughter think that the first DVD (White witch) has a prettier Narnia (snow, everything).The Prince Caspian DVD add a bit Shakespear drama to the story. The actors are very good, especially the one playing Miraz.Highly recommend this to any Narnia fans!"
positive,"The autobiography of ""EVERY"" Caribbean mother.: Jamaica Kincaid's work always provokes sentiment for me. As a fellow Caribbean native, she describes some deep darks truths about people. . .truths that are consistent only among Caribs as they are influenced by thier social and cultural norms.In this novel, the mother's character, at parts, seemed much like my own mother: Having a dream of a better existence, but having it crushed by a woman whose dreams have also been diminished. And thus, a vicious cycle within a society of women who never seem to truly live; instead, only exist to raise other crushed little girls to yield even more unfulfilled woman.Don't look for any made-up or whimsical fantasies here. You will find yourself precisely where little secrets lie. . .in places you will only visit by way of Kincaid's chariot."
positive,"Go to the Ant: This cassette has musically rich tunes with sound, biblical lyrics. Judy Rogers uses mostly guitar with her songs. She has a very pleasant-sounding voice. She comes from a Reformed background - each song is well-written and pure in its doctrine. This tape has songs encouraging children to enjoy their work, to keep their conversation edifying and to listen to the words of their parents. My children have grown up listening to her many tapes - this one is for the younger ones, say ages 3 to 10. I have bought over a dozen copies as birthday gifts for friends of mine. Enjoy!"
positive,"THE BEST CD!!!: everyone MUST go out and buy this wonderful cd by super star Clay Aiken!! it will leave you breathless and wanting more!! don't delay, it will sell out fast!!!"
negative,"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is tedious,dull and too long: I think this book is too boring for kids to read.it is very tedious and continues with the same boring facts over and over for 224 pages in a row and when it finally does get to an ok part it only says 5 words on it.my favorite parts are few and far between.it also has incorrect information.what is the chance of a person from the barbados,which are further south than the bahamas and very close to the equator,having no tan whatsoever and speaking perfect english?I rest my case."
positive,"Awesome: Wish there were more books like this. The cook book section requires a lot of deciphering though. I've got a chemistry degree which helps, but I still spent a lot of time researching the chemicals and apparatus."
negative,"Don't be fooled by the name; this is just a CHEAP shirt.: If you are looking for Bill Blass quality (go and check it out in a store), then keep away from this.On the other hand, if you are looking for a CHEAP shirt, then this is the real thing."
negative,Sound Quality is Lacking: Purchased this for use with my Tracks HD and as others have stated above the sound quality was greatly lowered for me and my left speakers sound is off with this product. Glad I didn't waste more than I did on this.
negative,"Does not fit in my Xbox 360: I bought this cable for my Xbox so I can get better picture quality on my TV when playing. I received the HDMI cable fine, but when attempting to put this in the HDMI port on my Xbox, the cable would not fit because of my AV cable. Cable should be a bit thinner so both the AV cable and HDMI can fit at the same time."
positive,"CSI continues to bring the detective side out of you.: After becoming addictive to the CSI series, I just can't seemto get enough. So I purchased the third complete series to geton with the excitement and I couldn't stop.Each episode is such a unique story, with twisted human emotionsand perceptions of the truth and the real truth. And how the human mindis so animalistic. This season only had one returning character, but made itworth while to get more insight of the character of Gil Crissom. And WarrickBrown returns to his oldneighborhood to give you a perspective of his past.All in all, if you're into CSI: Las Vegas, you'll enjoy thisseason as mush as 1 and 2."
positive,"BEWARE -- this is a HUGE pan: Farberware classic is great -- an inexpensive yet equally functional alternative to the very expensive pots & pans. Note: recently Farberware reduced its quality, in that older Farberware pots & pans had their thick aluminum base completely encased within a stainless steel shell. The newer pots & pans have the aluminum base attached to the bottom, but not encased within a stainless steel bottom. So, their quality is less than it was; most people who ""grew up with Farberware"" may not realize this. Farberware used to hold the patent on the technique of having the aluminum base CURVE up the side of the pan -- they no longer do this, and are the same as many other manufacturers. Also note: if you are buying a 12"" pan, this is a HUGE pan, since it has a squareish cross-section. I found it to be so absolutely huge -- you could fry a dozen onions in this monster -- that I simply never use it. The 10"" and 8"" sizes may be what you're looking for!"
negative,"1916 - Watch For The Miniseries: Want a good mini series? Start out on the decks of the Titanic, add a scandalous affair between a priest and an abused wife, force the hero to chose between the stuffy beauty and the golden hearted prostitute, add lots of arguments, and conclude with gunfire. Sound familiar? 1916 was a great concept. The poet warriors' futile battle with the British could have spun like Braveheart, but it became a very slow- moving Gun Fight At The OK Corral."
positive,"LA strikes again: Once you get through the almost Playboy, LA lipstick versions of gay women and just settle in, The L Word is a lot of fun. It has become a cult in the lesbian circles and is actually a very interesting story. Don't know how much longer they should keep going though. All good stories slow down and this is no exception. It is, however, still fun, sassy and sexy. I recommend it!"
negative,"Not that great: Will not buy again, save your money and just buy LUVS, the only advantage the baby dry have is that they smell good. We went thru almost twice as many diapers trying to keep our baby dry.lol"
negative,"DONT READ THIS BOOK: Ray Bradbury tries to write a bestseller in this boring novel. He keeps the audience in the book for about three pages, then everyone falls asleep. If he could do it again, I think he should have never written books in the first place."
negative,"entry mixed up: I want to know about the The Chameleons (UK) music DVD, not the Russian movie the entry mixes in. 1 star because the page is useless."
negative,"The Number Does Not Deliver: Lee Eisenberg's ""The Number"" simply does not live up to its promise as a financial planning self-help book or retirement guide. Short on advice and long on anecdotes, little useful information is imparted. Much better advice can be found in Eric Tyson's ""Personal Finance for Dummies"", a truly helfpful finance guide for the average person."
positive,A Majority of One: This is one of my favorite movies. Rosalind Russell and Alex Guinness are just wonderful in it. Great movie!! I am so glad that is finally available on DVD. Thank you Amazon.
negative,"Very disappointed!!: I didn't like the workout, Donna's teaching style and some of the music that was played in the background. She talks way too much. It only got my heart rate up very little. The workout was not fun at all! Save your money and invest in Tamilee's Tighter Assets or her ""I want that"" series. It is a much better investment."
positive,simplify your beauty regime: Yowsa!Talk about making it easy for us. This book gets right to the point. The title says it all.
positive,"Alterna-Metal ExtraOrdinaires!: This album kills their last. This one is way more raw, loud and noisy. But also more melodic. They have managed to flesh out their sound and experiment enough to stand out from the rest of SCREAMO. More inspired than most, Glassjaw have an energy; a creative edge consisting of both brains and brauns. And the lead singer,...that mug can scream! They have made their mark in hardcore - with this album, they are well on their way to joining the ranks of alterna-metal pioneers/revolutionaries/extraordinaires such as Deftones, Hum, Tool... i know thats saying alot. But this album drips with ingenuity, art, and uncompromised sound - quenching my thirsty ears.GlassJaw continue to push the envelope...Can't wait for the next 1."
positive,"Crazy In the Woods: You must buy this film, It is one of the best horror films that Ive seen in the last couple of years...Stanley & Simon are brothers & well they like to hunt & kill ......"
positive,Great: Easy to install and works great. I use it with Adobe Premiere and several types of cameras and dv decks.
positive,"Narnia strikes again!!: Some sequels do not carry the intensity and glory of their pilot movies. This movie definitely does. The main characters are all back and they are involved in an attempt to restore Narnia to its formal glory. The action is top notched and the story grips you from the beginning. The blu-ray version looks great and the sound is crisp and intense. Although some of the movie is not actually in C.S. Lewis' novel, it still stays true to the story line and fans of the beloved series will love this movie. I can't wait until the third movie release. Bring it on!!!"
negative,"Time to Revitalize: I think I have read everything Hillerman has written. Hunting Badger, is, at least in my opinion, his worst work. We already know Chee, Leaphorn and the other staple characters. Very disappointingly, Hunting Badger has no character development of the antagonists, no suspenseful plot and no real conclusion. This book seems to me to be a ""My editors want another book."" piece. I look forward to additional Hillerman books with hope that he will again do his usual interesting charatcer development as well as geographically detailed work. But, as far as Hunting Badger goes, miss it. It isn't very good. jbd"
negative,"Where's the ""beef""?: My hat is off to the author for his timing and marketing. He will surely move closer to his ""number"" with sales of this book. For those of you looking for more than reassurance that you are not alone in the search, don't waste your time and money on this book. Find a good advisor or start studying on your own and save money through whatever retirement plan that you have at your disposal. Finding the ""number"" is not nearly as difficult as having the discipline to save towards reaching it."
negative,"Disappointment: Followed the instructions on fluffing, still the pillow is terrible. Purchased a pair of down pillows from Sam's for $16/pair, this horrific investment cost around $45 and I don't use it at all. Stay away."
negative,"could be stupidest book ever: Predictable, boring, and above all STUPID. I love sci-fi horror even bad sci-fi horror. But let's get real. This is an unconvincing book that is a complete waste of time. The characters are predictable and stupid. After 15 minutes I found myself wanting to put the book down but had to read on (my bad). I found myself wondering who really wrote this? If it was King I was sure he must have alzheimers because he sure forgot how to write. The movie is even worse!"
negative,"Kiddie porn exploitation without any musical significance: An entirely artificial project, manufactured by their (middle-aged male) manager Ivan Shapovalov. Break into the big money western music markets by exploiting a theme that's near and dear to every (middle aged male's) heart: teenage lesbianism. The girls were simply picked for the job.Music: formulaic dance tracks, incompetent singing, banal ""gay-PC"" lyrics.Would have given 0 stars if I could.As far as introduction to modern Russian music, this one leaves everything to be desired."
positive,"Excellently woven tale, keeps you riveted.: This is a wonderful coming-of-age story, set in a fantastical land. Paolini does a good job of skillfully weaving the tapestry together so that you care about the characters. It's a hard book to put down once you get started.As to another reviewer who graded the book poorly for being ""derivative"", I seriously doubt there are any wholly original tales out there. What makes any work unique are the characters and events and how they are arranged to make a whole. By that standard, Eragon *is* unique, and very enjoyable."
negative,"These guys really suck.: This cd is horrible!!! I thought that it might sound a little like there first, but it just sounded weird. It was so bad that when i put it in my cd player, i started bleeding from my ears. Skip this cd for gods sake and by something better like a rake or a loaf of bread."
positive,autobiography of ben franklin: Good review of one of our founding fathers. A little light on info on Mr Franklins later life. I really like this book. I am sharing info with my children
negative,"Bad memory leakes: The software is nice to work with, not very simple to use but usable none the less. The only problem I've encountered with this software is the notoriously bad encoder with memory leaks up to wazoo. If you try to encode a large movie file into mpeg2 premiere will more than likely crash on you due to bad memory management. The only solution so far is to simply restart the system and pray it wouldn't happen again. Although from my experience it seems to work the 3rd time you try. I have tried this on two brand new machines one with a new XP 32bit install and both expereienced the same issue."
negative,worst movie ever: this movie is one of the worst horror movies i seen. they should of never had made this piece of crap in the first place.
positive,"Best Coffee Ever: Short and sweet. This brewer makes the best coffee I have ever made at home. K-Cups are on the pricey side but the convenience outweighs the cost. Average time for a fresh cup is 30-40 seconds and makes another as fast as you can put a new K-Cup in the machine. Hope I don't wear it out as I use it 4-5 times per day. I have not tried any other type of single coffee brewer out there, but this one meets all my needs. Quality seems to be excellent."
positive,"Dolly's Best Album: I have been a Dolly Parton fan for longer than I can remember. I listened to my cassette with Jolene until I wore it out. This is Dolly Parton's best album ever. Period. There is not a bad song on the record. Her soulful, plaintive ballads contrast with driving bluegrass melodies to create a complete album. There is no way to really explain how good this album is - you just have to experience it for yourself. If you are a fan of Dolly Parton or just bluegrass music in general, you need to buy this album."
positive,bridge is one solid piece: love that the part of the bridge that goes over the tract and has the tunnel cut out for the train to go over is one solid piece. Some other brands have that part of the bridge as two pieces and the bridge is always collapsing. what i don't like is the round plastic pieces that connect it to the rest of the train tract. If you're going to make a wooden train track make it all wood please. A friend of ours has this bridge and she's already lost one of the plastic round pieces that connects it to the rest of the track.
positive,"Fantastic: I first read this book in 7th grade, for English class. I don't understand why some other teenagers don't appreciate this book. It really is a great book, with well-established themes. The downward spiral these boys take really draws you into the story."
positive,"Time to think: George Orwell is a master of the English language, his superb style of writing and the intensity of the story is sustained throughout.The novel covers a timeless issue. Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius."
positive,Lost Balls- a great photgraphic journey: Charles Lindsay has captured the true soul of golf with this photographic journey through some of the most interesting places in the world. This book is perfect for the person who truely loves and understands the game of golf. His combination of humor and photographic genius make this a wonderfully entaining book for anyone who has ever played the game. I hope there is a sequel.
negative,"WHY?: Ray J is not a thug... This as well as his image is all a FRAUD. It's insufferable listening to all his whining. Even R. Kelly's presence on ""Quit Actin'"" and Mya on ""Sexy"" are not enough to save this garbage. Ray J take a hint and ""Quit Actin'"" yourself and while you are at it stop singing too."
positive,"Incredibly engaging: I had to read this book for a Senior Seminar in English and was surprised to find that it was an entertaining read. Granted, one must suspend disbelief in a few places in order to allow for coincidences but what Chesnutt does is something of a pastiche of different writing genres. He also goes to the very limits in portraying the many gradations that existed in the Southern color line.In truth, most of the characters are not necessarily likeable, but one cannot help turning the pages to see who will do what next. Those who chanced to pass for white were never far from an intrigue of some kind.This is a fast read as well as an entertaining one, and while Chesnutt plays with many different styles and humors, it is not without historical merit."
negative,"A Rocky Tale: Armand is a hobo and hates children. One day, he arrives back under the bridge (his home) only to find kids and their mother. He becomes attached to them and gives them life experiences but can he give them there Christmas wish?I thought this book had a great meaning but it wasn't that good. The book wasn't an addicting story, and the story wasn't well written. Also it seemed to change course throughout the story. It was a rocky book and the author didn't do a good job of keeping the story in one style. I wouldn't recommend this book even if it sounds intresting."
negative,"A New Translation: This is a new translation (2006) of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. I hope someone qualified might soon comment on the merits or significance of this new translation. Meanwhile, the Editorial Review information offered for this book comes from an earlier edition of a different translation of Freud's work, FWIW. And the second paragraph in the editorial review prelim is entirely inappropriate--it's for another book altogether.I give Freud's book (not the translation) a low rating because it is misleading. It's not about the interpretation of dreams in general, but more specifically it's, covertly of course, about Freud's own dreams. More basically, it's about ""infantile memories"" he claimed dreams concealed. (For more explanation of this point, one could consult ""If Freud's Theory Be True..."" in Psychological Reports (1992, 70, 611-620), which would explain how Freud himself tells us his book is not about what it appears to be about."
positive,"Timeless and cozy like an old worn out sweater!: This book is as wonderful today as it was years ago! I agree about the missing Burpers - I want them back! But still a wonderful and fun way to instill principles of courtesy in the reader. A wonderful reminder of years gone by and if we are lucky a promise of what we can be in the years ahead. Just be nice to one another! Ann Clarke, author ofPeople Are So Different!based on tolerance and understanding."
positive,"RAVE REVIEWS: I love the item but I have been the one receiving rave reviews for the past 5 years. I purchased this on Madison Avenue in one of those extravagant places and here is the same exact thing for 12.99???Anyway, I wear it over my shoulders, around my waist with sexy pants, around my waist as a sarong and use it as a blouse sometimes when I travel to a tropical area of course.Everyone loves it and even now years later, I still get compliments. I am buying one now in case something happens to this one."
positive,"Truly empowering, uplifting and inspirational ! A MUST read!: The God-Mind Connection ( and the books which follow in the the trilogy) outline for us how to achieve all that we want - both spiritually AND materially.( No, they are NOT mutually exclusive!!) How to achieve true success and real peace of mind. The most amazing thing is that it is all available to us simply for the asking - no special exercises, no sacrifices. AND IT WORKS!!! This is a must read if you want to know how to have everything you ever wanted for yourself and for those you love. And you'll want to give a copy to everyone you care about, too!"
negative,"1 Good Song = 1 Star: I can't believe that Ghostface Killah could make such a sucky album, after making his classic album ""Ironman"" Anyway, I only gave this album one star, because there was only one song on this album that I could enjoy, and that's ""Tush"""
negative,"Extremely Weak Psychological Thriller: I'm surprised to see that other people actually enjoyed this film, since I would rank it as perhaps the worst psychological thriller I have ever seen. A turgid script, weak lead performances, and lackluster direction make for a tedious experience. The DVD transfer is acceptable, though the contrast is rather excessive (perhaps a recently struck print was the source). With so many fine films unreleased on DVD, it is rather a mystery why this entirely lackluster effort has been released."
positive,mean Blu-ray: It's a mean Blu-ray with lots of extras good picture and sound Agood price look like it was made yesterday
positive,"Super!!!: I don't often write reviews but I had to write about the Keurig B70. I have tried nearly every coffee maker I've seen. My most recent one was a Senseo. I was always spilling water - either filling the tank or after a cup was brewed. To use a travel mug, I had to brew into a regular mug and pour it into the travel mug. The Keurig B70 solves these problems. Almost all of my 16 oz. travel mugs fit under the spout. You can remove the tank to fill it but I leave it on the machine and fill it with a jug. I remove the K-cup right after brewing and there is no leakage. There is a big variety of coffees available or you can use your own (and adjust the strength of brew) using a separate adapter. I will buy another when this one finally quits."
positive,"Best in the series so far: Sam Vimes is my favorite Discworld character, and this book is his triumph! I've read all of the Discworld books to date, and this one is my favorite. Keeps the reader in suspense, and I couldn't put it down. Great characters from the Discworld are seen in their younger days. A must read for all Discworld and Pratchett fans!"
negative,"Pure trash: This lap desk is a joke. As the other reviews indicate, it is very flimsy. The pads are not comfortable. We simply threw the lamp away. We tried to return the desk, but were given a full credit for the cost and told to keep the desk, so you might say in the end we paid what it was worth."
negative,"Not the story LeCarre wrote: This movie presents a different story altogether than the one LeCarre wrote. The plot line of Harry and Marta was not the unspoken love story of the book, and the ending in no way resembled LeCarre's tale. The verbally explosive scene at the tailor shop makes Harry the one who gets upset, rather than Mickey (via Harry's humiliation of him), giving Mickey's suicide a different motivation entirely. The episode where Harry moves Mickey's body and cleans up Mickey's apartment is left out. Louisa is given an alternate personality more suitable to Jamie Lee Curtis. Don't waste your time and money--read the book. Better yet, listen to The John LeCarre Collection audio. Let LeCarre tell the story himself--he does so wonderfully."
negative,"The Great Indian Wars 1840-1890: This is without a doubt the worst video I have ever watched.The videos picture could not tracted without jumping lines and wiggling screen it was painful for me to watch.The movie itself was out of focus.They used old black and white movies"" indians meet the cavalry "" to illustrate the action and pencil drawings of the indian chiefs while they spoke of them. There was one man speaking with a monotone voice.After five minutes it became very boring to watch.The movie was put together very poorly and hard to watch the pictures had very little contrast, and hard listen to.It was so bad I could'nt retain any of infomation,my mind kept wandering off. If you enjoy being bored,and having your ears and eyes assulted by this low grade quality picture this movie is for you. Reviewed by Paul Phillips"
positive,"Advice to potential buyers: Just wanted to mention a few things the other reviewers didn't. This player supports the WMA format which iPOD does not. I have the 8GB unit and expanded it with a 4GB MicroSD card. After adding the Micro SD card, the unit took about 90 seconds to start up, and battery life was reduced from 3 hours to about 30 minutes! Overall, I love it as a MP3 player, but would recommend you go with a unit with 16GB built-in storage if you think you'll need that much room."
negative,"Title tallies to music samples: Mon 27.12.2004 21:37The website music samples should tally with the music titles.Wrong tally makes for difficulty in hunting for the tune that I want.Please ignore the rating.Regards,Justin - Edinburgh"
negative,"Get the free version and save your money for a cup of coffee: It's not worth it, even with the low price of 1.99. You're better off getting the free version. The only thing you're going to get is a couple of illustrations and there is no link for a free audio book like it says there is."
negative,"Terrible game, very disappointing: I wrote this review only to bring the average rating more in line with reality. I would definitely recommend playing this game before buying it. The story is fine and the graphics are nice, but the gameplay is so [weak]that it will bore your socks off. I used to play way too many hours of MUDs and other text-based adventure games, so I have a high tolerance for bad interface, but this game is potentially the worst I have ever seen. In fact, the game would be much better if they had replicated the character interface from ""rogue/moria"" and put it on the GBA ;)"
negative,"Total cheese-fest: I can't believe movies like this get made! This movie is CHEESY from start to finish. The characters are empty, the plot is thin, and the cliches are in abundance. Buy/rent this movie only if you want to laugh at the money you just wasted."
positive,"powerful: Hey you girls who think this book is ""aweful,"" first learn how to spell. ATKM might teach you how to. Second, if you read past the first few chapters, the action speeds up. Like any good book, the author needs to set up the action. Why'd you fool even bother reading the Cliff notes, which are written in boring scholarly tones? Warren was a true poet, and each and every word of this book was carefully selected to convey Penn's message of corruption and fate. By taking the reader through a story through the eyes of Jack Burden, Penn documents the changes of Jack's philosophy of events. An extremely rich book, gripping, and for you ignorant girls, the plot resembles TV soaps that you're probably spending too much time watching. If you want soap-opera twists, ATKM has them also. Reviewed by Jeff Goodkind, 11th grade."
positive,"Good Book on battles and campaigns: If you are in the market for a good book on the major battles and campaigns of the Revolutionary Army then this is the book for you. The author does an excellent job in describing each event without going to exacting detail and boring the reader. If you do not get pulled into the war after reading this book then you need to reread it slowly to better absorb the knowledge within its pages.I agree with another reviewer: ""This excellent piece of scholarship and tale of high deeds belongs on every enthusiasts bookshelf....""Pick up a copy at Amazon.com!"
positive,Shogun Assassin: I love this movie.I had not seen it for many years but it was as good as I remember. I have not seen the whole series so I cannot compare but this is definately one for the colection.
negative,"Neither Ironic nor Meaningful, Simply Dated: Call me a philistine, but ""Candide"" did more to confuse than enlighten me. Yes, I know the story is deliberately far fetched, almost surreal, but it still failed to make an impact even when considering the work in this context. Absurdity can only travel so far.My sad but brief review is that ""Candide"" is less meaningful today that it was at the time of its writing. No, I have not found the meaning of life but nor has Voltaire."
positive,"One of the best comedy albums in the last 10 years.: Criag Shoemaker has the abilty to use his voice unlike any other comdeian around. No matter what he says, or who he is at the time he says it (aka ""The Lovemaster"" or Barney Fife"" you can be sure he will make you laugh."
negative,"Learn to ride!: If you think you need this bit, you need to learn how to train and ride a horse better. There is never a need for such severity."
negative,"BORING: The only thing that saved this boring B movie was Matt Riddlehoover's cuteness. The script was bad, the acting was bad, but Matt is oh so cute. That's all that this movie is worth is to see Matt. Should've been 'more' of him to see, though, to make up for the dumbness of the movie."
positive,"Star Wars meets Fantasy?: Did anyone else realize the storyline was the same as Star Wars IV? It's a good book and fun to read, but half way through I realized it was the same basic story as Episode IV. I quized my son who was almost done with the next book ""Eldest"" and it's the same story line as Star Wars V!! I guess the 15 year old writer is just a good plagiarist."
negative,case closed NOT!: Okay so I guess I didn't read the 1 or 2 reviews that said the case doesn't close shut.It clicks shut then flips open. Anyway I will return what is essentially a pointless product now. Very disappointed.Seems the build quality is inconsistent as most reviews said it shut fine but 1 or 2 did report this problem
positive,"There's no such thing as Monsters!: The Lord of the Flies is a ""scary"" story because it's possible - it shows how people behave when under extreme stresses. Morals and ethics are luxuries of Civilization and are quickly shed when you are hungry, cold and miserable. Too bad author was overly influenced by Freud, but other than that the story is fascinating.We tell our kids, ""There's no such thing as Monsters!"" The truth is, the Monsters do exist inside of us. The sooner we realize that, the better chance we have at keeping them under self-control. As for kids, the same applies - unless you prefer letting the criminal justice system teach them to control their ""inner monsters."""
positive,THE SICCEST 1 EVER: EVERY SONG CRACKS ON THIS 1 JUST LIKE LYNCH C-BO SHOWS THE BESTRAPPERZ COME STRAIGHT FROM SAC-TOWN
positive,"Best Diapers: Among the Pampers Swaddlers, Costco Kirkland, and Huggies Snug and dry, this is so far the best and I am 100% satisfied and don't even want to try other brands. It is the softest one, even better than Pampers Swaddlers. It smells good but I think a little bit too strong. Use it for my baby day and night. Don't even to buy the night diapers. It is pretty dry even after the whole night."
positive,"""To not read this is a sin."" Toni VII, verse 4: Whoever read the first page of the book and like the stile of the exposition there must buy the book.There is nothing greater under the sun and on the Disk as well then that. (I can fill that my Gods are suffering because, I'm begining to belive in the book instead of them) But what can I do - it's stronger then me.What can I say (take a look on my e-mail address) It says it all."
positive,"The real story of globalization: ""Before one can cry Big Mac, Larsson humbles the critic of globalization into silence. Larsson is William Blake's ""Mental Traveler,"" taking the reader through ""a land of men and women"": the slums of Rocinha in Rio where police are more dangerous than gangsters; a Bosnian mother supporting her blind husband and mentally retarded daughter on sweater knitting. Put down your placard and have a veggie burger, this guy's been there.""- Zachary Wales, Business Correspondent, United Press International"
negative,"Worst book I've ever read!: I don't know who the target is for books like this, but I found it painfully bad. As a student of Irish history, I can tell you this book is not only poorly written but historically inaccurate. Not that perfect accuracy should be the goal of a fiction writer, but how about making an attempt at being accurate as well as entertaining? The book rambles on and on with little motivation for the character's actions or substance in the writing. Some of the passages are just laugh-out-loud ridiculous.""His face looked like a linen napkin"" Really? What does that mean? It was in someone's lap? It was covered in gravy?The author makes use of (often misspelled) Gaelic words throughout, but doesn't include a glossary. Are we supposed to be impressed? It just makes the sentences awkward.Avoid this book at all costs.If you want authentic, well-written historical fiction, stick with Pressfield or Rutherford. I just wish I'd read this one first before I'd ordered more by the same author."
positive,A must for any JL fan: My 3 year old son is OBSESSED with Justice League! Needless to say he HAD to have the watchtower! I too had read the bad reviews and ended up getting it here on Amazon! Yes the three legs don't stay on but after a week of putting them back on a hundred times a day I got out the superglue to secure them on and I have not had a single problem since! Granted you don't want to have to superglue a toy that should work on it's own but if your kid loves JL just buy some glue too!
negative,"This movie has beautiful Japanese Animation!: This movie was done by top notch Japanese Animators. It is so pretty, you could reach out and touch a Transformer. The voice cast include Judd Nelson, Leonard Nimoy, and Orson Welles in his last movie performance. Peter Cullen plays Optimus Prime. There is also wild special effects and lighting that is so breathtaking! To anyone who loves Japanese Animation I recommend this movie!"
negative,"Please quit leaving out pages, Nabu Press: Bancroft and Zumpt did a great job with the content. Nabu Press's print job is blurry, but the free Google ebook also has blurry printing. Maybe no clearly-printed exemplars exist. Nabu Press says on an end-paper: ""This book may have occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc. that were either part of the original artifact, or were introduced by the scanning process."" Nabu did indeed leave pages 136 and 137 out of this book. I got this book on a sale for something like 7 or 8 dollars. I am not going to pay full price for Nabu Press books until they give up their right to omit pages. The paper and ink are fine. If Nabu has worked from a clearly-printed exemplar, the book would probably be an excellent print-on-demand. Until Nabu Press quits excusing itself for bad workmanship on its books, I will only be tempted to buy their books when they are at a 2/3 discount."
negative,"Disappointingly dated: What a disappointingly dated book. i am amazed that amazon is selling this. Had i realized it was this old, I would not have bought it."
positive,WOW GO CLAY!: this cd was GREAT! there is definetly something for any age. i am 15 and just adore clay...and i think that his older fans would love this cd also. im going to be looking forward to when he can write his own...but this cd was just great even with other people writing for him. there are so many good songs and it just impresses me everytime i put it in! GO OUT AND GET THIS ONE! i bet ull love it too!
positive,"Timeless Classic: Read The Hobbit 35 years ago for the first time and many times since and throughout my life it has been a joy and a comfort. Knowing that Smaug will be defeated, that Gollum's ring will find it's way to safer pockets with brighter futures and that in the end the inhabitants of Middle Earth are not so different from ourselves. A children's book that grew into so much more. Professor Tolkien's written words are the true magic that the movies can never truely portray. Bought the Kindle version, my paperback is rather 'delicate' from being reread so many times, and illustrations and maps are clear and all included. Will continue on my quest to reread the Tolkien series on the Kindle, what better way to spend the afternoon than with old friends."
positive,"Woman's book of changes: This book is for older women who need to ""find themselves"" all over again and use as a tool to journal thier thoughts. As a woman in her 20's I still found it to be most helpfull in conjunction with my regualar Franklyn and Palm pilot as a way to organize my thoughts and goals through journal writting. It's a great gift for a woman of any age!"
negative,WARNING! Copy protection sucks!: I would advise not getting this CD for that reason - send a message. When I spend money on a CD I want to listen to it when and where I want to without having to download a bunch of software to my computer. I bought this CD today and I am returning it tomorrow.
negative,"Flimsy Bag Holder: The product seemed like a good idea but wish I had read all of the reviews before ordering. The product is not sturdy at all. It didn't come with the number of screws noted on the instructions so I had to go out and purchase more in order to finish putting it together. That was after I spent way to much time trying to decipher the instructions. Also, the clips that hold the bag to the frame are very tight and very difficult to put on and remove. I've torn every bag I've used. I hate wasting my money; but, I'll have to buy a better one."
positive,"Very helpful: I have been taking Belly Dance lessons for several years. I found this tape very helpful and the instructions clear. I think the intent of the tape is to introduce certain movements and let the viewer be creative. So if you are looking for a full workout you will not get it from the tape. You have to make your own. But that is one of the beauties of the tape. If you want to dance in the privacy of your home or if you are thinking of taking lessons, I think this would be great for you. It is a very gentle tape. Do not be fooled by the 1996 date listed here. That must be the reprint date, my tape said 1985 which explains the dated hair and makeup. Atea is not the most animated speaker but I think that is in line with gentle nature of the tape. I think the tape is very much in the spirit of belly dancing as it encourages the viewer to use her own style."
negative,"not happy: the ball was damaged {slightly} point it was supposed to be new, plus after shipping the price was higher than prices for the same thing at local stores, bad move on my part, lesson learned. do not reccomend this this product."
negative,"UNIVERSAL SUCKS: McMILLAN AND WIFE is a five star show, Universal is a negative 100,000. Do not expect to see any new McMillans from them, this show will have to be farmed out to get released in full. I am so sick of buying the first season of a series only to realize that the rest of the series won't be, like Kojak, etal. Or, you can buy the whole series, one DVD release at a time like I did for the Wild Wild West only to have it then re released WITH the two made for TV movies included and no you can't get the movies separate at this time. Keep ripping us off and sooner or later, no one will bother with your crap."
positive,"A Gem for Horse Lovers and History Lovers: A wonderful, wonderful story--absolutely a page turner. I first read it around 1949, and I can remember being moved to tears.I recently gave it as a gift to an eleven-year-old friend, and she is loving this book."
positive,"Best one so far!: This is one badass movie. The cgi is spectacular. The 3d is not that great, but the action is crazy, it never stops. Cant wait for Transformers 4. Keep up the great work!"
negative,"Dissapointing: I purchased this product to help eliminate my mild acne, and used it in conjunction with MDSkincare's cleanser/toner, and tinted moisturizer. I have 4 days left of my 30 day supply and have seen no improvement in my acne, or noticable improvement in overall skintone. Actually, I am now breaking out in places I've never had probelms with before. I will try Perricone products next, the MDScincare pads seemed to be a waste of $75 for me."
negative,"Cheap shots and low blows: Aside from the truth or falsity of the facts presented, this book serves more as a medium of insults to evolutionists rather than a respectable debate with them. Countless passive aggressive and unnecessary attacks on evolutionist in even simply referring to them, project the typical intolerant Creationist mindset rather than a respectable author.And yes, the cover is hilarious."
negative,"Leslie West.....: Leslie West is said to be Jeff Beck's favoite guitarist. That was over 30 years ago...now Leslie is just a shadow of his former self in more ways than one. There are really no memorable guitar solos on this entire album; plus his classic Les Paul Junior ""tube"" tone & vibrato are no where to be found. No really good songs or even guitar riffs either. I could not even listen to it all the way thru. If you want flat out...to the wall rock, pick up the new Blue Oyster Cult, Status Quo, or Ted Nugent cds; wait for this one to hit the cut-out bin."
negative,"Good beach book: With all the publicity surrounding this book, I was hoping for a great summer romance--'a woman conquers her greatest fears and overcomes her tentative inclinations in order to love again!' It was a good one night read. It actually seemed like a rough draft of a great book--fine, but not very satisfying. If you must, buy a used copy, or borrow one from the library."
positive,"Even the shortest game can succeed.: Ducktales is one of the very few games that prove that even the shortest game can succeed. There's only 5 levels, and you repeat 1, but those 5 levels are lengthy.The plot is that Scrooge McDuck, the richest duck in the world, wants to be even richer by traveling around the world, finding treasures.You can go to Transylvania, the Amazon, the Moon, the Himalayas, and the African Mines.Ducktales shares certain similarities to MegaMan, like the level selection, how the levels scroll when you fall, and how there's a boss at the end of every level. In fact, Capcom made this game.The game is a nice side-scrolling platformer with impressive graphics and upbeat Capcom sounds and music."
negative,Fahrenheit 451 Audiobook: Some Authors should NOT read their books for the audio format. This is by far the worst I have heard. I found it extremely difficult to follow the story which sounded like it was being read by my great grandfather!
negative,"Not for the faint of heart: A darker view of comics and not for children or teens.Many plots circle around murder, psychosis, brain-wipes, and the absolute authority to make decisions. DC has moved from the safe superhero (who are morally justified) into an area where there is little to distinguish their actions from the bag guys. No longer is it good guys against bad guys. This is a real good example of how once cherished absolute ideas of our youth have been subverted into shades of grey to shock the new generation. I see these issues reflected in society, politics and the nightly news. I don't need to see them in my lighthearted 'pleasure' readings. Wasted my money on this item. Calvin and Hobbes would have been a better buy."
positive,"Great product!!!: I love this product. It is a light fragrance. I rated this product a 5 because it has a great smell and it was very cheap. If you buy this product out of Macy, you will spend more."
positive,"The impact is enormous!: This book was magnificent. I started it knowing how it would end, yet I was still close to tears when I put down this wonderful book. A wonderful book for someone who wants to read an amazing classic, yet doesn't want to have to spend four or five months reading it."
negative,"Stupidly funny.: Sorority Boys is the dumbest, pointless, and offensive film of 2002. With that being said, this film does have some funny jokes and thanks to Michael Rosenbaum, he keeps this sex comedy from sinking fast. Rosenbaum has great comic timing which isn't always apparent since he plays Lex Luthor on Smallville, he gets to show his funny bone and he is a hoot! Barry Watson is quite pretty as a girl but this film is no Animal House. This film is a guilty pleasure, so it keep it a secret. Good luck!"
negative,"Boring: I was so ready to be done with this book. I absolutely loved the others in the series...lost major parts of entire days reading them non-stop, but this long awaited addition is nothing but repetitious drivel. Really, how many times does Ayla need to be formally introduced. How many caves, rivers & landscapes need to be described in such detail that the reader loses all interest. Nothing happens that I cared about at all."
positive,"Amazing for struggling readers: I ordered this book for my 9th grade regular students for learning Romeo and Juliet. It has the Shakespeare version on one side and the plain English translation on the other. It really helped some of my lower level students get involved in learning the play instead of getting discourage because they didn't understand the language. I highly recommend this product, especially for struggling readers."
negative,"Great Film, Wretched Video: I hate to spoil the lovefest... yes, I agree with previous reviews as to the greatness of the work, but people need beware the truly horrendous quality of the transfer. The image and sound quality are appalling; it's discouraging that such a cinematic masterpiece gets such slipshod treatment.My message to the company that released this: get your act together or give the rights to someone who can do the job properly! Don't buy this version!"
negative,"barely works: This thing would never stay suctioned down to any surface. So you are forced to hold the sharpener while trying to sharpen the pencil, and half the time it won't even sharpen them properly, it will just ""eat"" them. And then the plastic cover breaks. This happened to 2 different sharpeners. Find something that is better quality. it's not worth your time."
negative,"Big Thumbs Down for New Illustrations: I love Brett Helquist. His illustrations for A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example, are wonderful. However, his work does not belong here. Stephen Gammell's illustrations are really what made these books the classics that they are (no offense meant to Alvin Shwartz). I will be looking for copies with the proper illustrations as soon as I can find them."
positive,"Love bird in love: My love bird, Josie, goes crazy for this toy. She flips the mirrors around and talks to herself for hours. She did destroy her first one but she's so cute playing with it that I have to keep them in stock."
negative,"The old one was better...: I originally bought the iLuv transmitter over others because the transmitter ran off the iPod's battery and wasn't solely reliant on the car's electrical system to be used. Since my car currently has an issue with the electrical system (the lighter/plugs don't work) I pretty much wasted my money buying this new version since it cannot be powered off the iPod itself. I don't know why iLuv changed what I considered a unique and useful part of their product to be just like everyone else, but I am thoroughly disappointed to have wasted 34 bucks on it."
negative,"disapointed: I was delighted with the early arrival then schedule of this DVD. However I didn't enjoy it at all. I was hoping to here the original songs of Etta James and the acting wasn't that good either, which made for a boring movie."
negative,"yuck!: Wow, I can't believe that somebody actually published this piece of crap. It reads like it was written like a fifteen year old who has read way too much sci-fi/fantasy and not enough of anything else. Reading this book was kind of like driving a square-wheeled car. Ka-chunk Ka-chunk Ka-chunk. It was very slow in most places and the ""made up language"" distracted from the story rather than adding to it. (BTW Tolkien had a PhD in medieval languages, he kind of knew what he was doing). The main part of the action was in the last few pages and things happened almost too quickly and I was forced to re-read several times to grasp what was going on. I hope that the sequel is better, but I'm not ready to waste my time reading it."
negative,"Kerry risked others lives for his career: The book is a whitewash on how Kerry & Jane Fonda helped North Vietnam. Kerry & Fonda's efforts encouraged the North Vietnamese to fight on. The NV leadership said they were ready to go for a conditional surrender after 1969 but decided to fight on thanks to the efforts of Kerry, Fonda and Ramsey Clark.Kerry is a hero in JFK's Vietnam War but a hero for North Vietnam. In 1975, the North Vietnamese rewarded Kerry with a sweetheart real esatet deal for Kerry's cousin."
negative,"It's okay.: The hero is quite nice, but the heroine is a bit too odd sometimes. The repartee between them is good and there are steamy love scenes. But the secondary characters are weak or unintentionally creepy and the ""magic"" is silly, dragging the story down.A very mixed bag. If I'd read it more recently, I might actually lower the rating."
negative,"Not a pleasant experience: While a more than adequate insight into everyday life in the England of George III, this book serves the uninitiated reader of O'Brian's work poorly. Nothing much takes place during the story, and what little as does, takes place offstage, as it were. Characters and events are introduced that lead no where and serve no purpose other than to fill the page. While the real world is often like that, works of art are not the real world, and novels are not documentaries. I was grossly disappointed in this book, as I had read such wonderful things about this series, and I will give O'Brian another chance, but I did not find any charcters other than Aubrey and Maturin to be given any definition, and their characters were more described than shown. Reading The Yellow Admiral (a pretentious title providing no insight into the plot nor encouragement to the reader) was not a pleasant experience."
positive,"Not as good a Viva: For me, this sophmore effort from Cibo Matto is a little bit disappointing. This time around there are less food references one of the things I loved on the first lp and second this album is less wacky and hip-hop oriented with the exception of Sci-Fi Wasabi. You definitely can feel the influence of Sean Lennon on this album. It seems Cibo has gone toward the pop route, which is not good. A plus side of this album is that it demonstrates Miho's great voice, she is way more clear and fluent on this one. Moonchild is a good example on how good Miho's voice is. I like how Cibo is evolving their sound, but this evolution is below par, hopefully the next time around they evolve again for the better. Overall is a good album, but I like Viva better."
negative,"Doesn't even play: I think it's not an authentic copy cuz it won't even play on my dvd. It tells me it's the ""wrong region""."
positive,"More Relavent Now than Ever: Anyone who is interested in the nature of power and manipulation of the masses should read this book. Despite the fact that it was orriginaly an inditement against Stalinism, it is still relevant in 21st century America.The nature of the ""War on Terror"" could have been taken dirrectly from the book, in places word for word. The story provides facinating insight into the way that reasonably inteligent people can chose to behave in irrational ways in the name of partiatism and loyalty."
positive,"A True Masterpiece: This movie ranks among my all-time favorites. Sure, the animation may not be perfect, and the DVD release could be better, and there are just a couple of thematic elements here and there that I could do without, but nonetheless, this movie is a classic.It's a wonderful movie about unicorns and love and destiny, and discovering who you are. The music is brilliant, and the actors are superb. If I could be any character in this movie, I'd like to be the butterfly, or the cat, or the talking skull, or even Mommy Fortuna!"
positive,"Quest for Fire: Adapted from a novel by J.H. Rosny Sr., ""Quest"" is a credible and riveting what-if look at the life ways of early humans. Intent on verisimilitude, the producers enlisted novelist Anthony Burgess to create a primitive language spoken by the actors, while zoologist Desmond Morris (author of ""The Naked Ape"") was asked to choreograph their body movements. Depicted by Annaud as aggressive and carnal, the Ulams also come across with a certain poignancy, as curious creatures amazed and delighted by the appearance of a flame. Shot at remote locations in Scotland, Kenya, Iceland, and Canada, ""Quest"" is not a glorified National Geographic re-enactment--it's a compelling drama about fear and survival at the dawn of man."
negative,"disappointed: I LOVED the movie, so I bought the book....it was a great disappointment. The amazing movie writers did an amazing wonderful job of turning Julie Powells book into a fun movie. The Book is NOTHING like the movie. The book is foul mouthed trash. I stopped reading after 3 chapters. It is no wonder that Julia Child didn't like Julia Powells book. I was extremely disappointed. If you liked the movie.... don't buy the book."
negative,"Defective: Might be a good deal for the price if it worked. Mine came and it was already turned on. When I try to turn it off it doesn't and actually adds to the number on the digital display. I tried the spare battery just in case this was a low battery problem and that didn't help.When I could get it to work it did appear to be accurate 80% of the time. Sometimes though it would go out of whack.I really like the price and the product seems good, which is why I gave it 2 stars. It seems sold and I figure that I just got a bad one which is possible with any product. I'm thinking of ordering another to see if I have better luck with the second."
negative,"Lost: 121 minutes: Well, that's 121 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Last year, I was compelled to see an animated movie about guinea pigs saving the world. It was the worst movie I ever saw. Now, it's the second worst movie I ever saw. Do yourself a favor and give ""Bad Lieuenant"" a miss."
positive,"Interfaith Symbol Charm: The order came in a timely manner, It was in perfect condition. I was greatly please with the service and the product."
positive,"Counldn't have done it without this book....: I actually bought this book at a lactation consultant's suggestion and at her offices. My child was 5.5 weeks premature and had difficulty learning the suck/swallow reflex. I read this book while pumping in the hospital NICU as well as at home. This book answered each and every question I had throughout my nursing relationship with my child (now almost 2). I highly recommend this book to all mothers who want to do everything they can to educate themselves about nursing their child. Because of my experience with it, whenever a friend of mine is pregnant and planning on nursing, I put together a care package for her that includes this book, a tube of Lansinoh cream, and breast pads along with other gifts for her baby shower!"
positive,"Works great!: I had a wireless USB adapter, and it does not compare to this! Easy to install and hasn't dropped signal on me yet"
positive,"Suprisingly, a very good movie: i expected this movie to be terrible, but might as well see it. I was proved wrong. My favorite part has to be the scene at goofy goober's.FINAL THOUGHT - buy, see, rent, steal,or borrow this movie"
negative,"Sparkly and pretty...: but when you put the necklace on, you can't even see either the sparkle, or the beauty of it. The stones are very small, which is expected. What is not expected is that the stones are linked by 3...(Meaning, 3 stones seem to be soldered together, then connected to 3 more stones, etc.) This made for an awkward appearance when worn since it's not ""fluid."" In other words, the necklace would ""flip"" constantly, and all you saw was silver and not the ""topaz.""I considered keeping it anyways because the price was great, the stones are sparkly and the color pretty, but the 18"" wouldnt fit 3x around my wrist (2x made it too large) to be worn as a bracelet of some sorts.Unfortunately, this will have to go back. I wish it was better designed for more movement of each stone so that it laid better against the skin."
positive,Better than the movie: This is a quick read and fast moving book. Don't watch the movie too you've read it. The movie barely does it justice...unique book I would recommend to all
positive,"If People Are Looking For Vintage McCartney, this album doesn't disappoint!!!: If there is any part of McCartney's solo workthat's underrated, it lies squarely here..from the cool funk/operatic jazz infusedReception to the jazz based Arrow Through Me,and some relatively hard rock that would haveJohn Lennon proud, this is really Paul McCartneyat his best folks... very creative, Linda's finallyin tune... excellent effort and well worth theinvestment... Back To The Egg stands along withTug of War as one of his finest achievements!You can see why Lennon was beginning to softenin those 1980 Rolling Stone interviews whereinstead of attacking his former partner,he acknowledges his gifts."
negative,"New meaning to the term ""thin""!: Description of the comforter does point out that it is lightweight that would be an understatement. More like a poor quality sheet with a bit of down in between the layers. Made in China of only 74% down. To state that this comforter has a retail price of $160 is laughable! Really more of a throw than a comforter. At $50 it is grossly overpriced! Look elsewhere!"
negative,"pathetic, horrible: My biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't give any rhyme or reason as to why anyone, least of all the King, would follow her. It does not explain how Joan became known as the Maid of Lorraine or why the ""peasants"" would love her. She acted pretty much psychotic and very high-strung throughout the entire movie(based on the fact that she saw her sister raped even though this is not historical). The woman in that movie noone would have followed.My other major problem with the movie is the ""visions"". They made absolutely no sense, and instead of getting a sense of ""God"" (goodness,light,etc). You just get a dark feeling. . . .ugh . . ."
positive,"Good product nonetheless: I just had one problem with the delivery wherein one bottle (soft wash gel) leaked but this was replaced immediately. I'm very pleased with the ease of use and results produced by the cleaner wax, quik detailer and quik interior detailer. The only thing to make this better is they add one or two micro fiber towels. Got this for $20 a few months ago."
negative,Best Suited for the Landfill: This movie was so disappointing I threw it in the trash. It is not even worthy of passing on to someone else.
positive,Use for PM exam: The chapters cover the material with lots of problems and solutions. The only book I used and I aced exam
positive,"Children like this book: My children (ages 5-10) love this book. I have also read from this book to hospitalized teenagers; when I read Oedipus I finished the story and heard a chorus of ""read it again!""I noticed that some of the reviews posted here say that this book is unsuitable for children, but I wonder if the reviewers actually tried reading the book to them."
negative,"Could be a lot better!!!: Where do I start, how about I hate these diapers!! This gel stuff leaks out of them, all the time. They don't last long on active babies. Not to mention that I have to clean up leakage. Try another brand please!!"
positive,"Interesting information on what our dreams mean: This is the second book I've read by Sylvia Browne. I enjoy her insights and the information about dreams, life after death, astral visits, etc. I am always interested in reading spirituality books, and I found this book of dreams very enlightening.I have recently read ""What Dreams May Come"" by Richard Matheson about life after death, and what I found interesting was that his book was written in the late 70's and a lot of Browne's facts/theories in her book match with what Matheson wrote about in his fictional love story. (The Hall of Wisdom, Working plateaus, etc).There were still a few times while reading ""Book of Dreams"" where I had to really shake my head and wonder, ""Wow, is she for real??"" But I kept reading and I think the ideas and theories do make some sense. Since her theories are hard to prove, our faith and beliefs are what spirituality is all about. I enjoy Browne and her books, and I rate this read a 4 out of 5 stars."
positive,"Nicely Made Bit, But Actually a 1/2"" by 1"" Cutter: These Milwaukee router bits are presently being clearanced out by multiple sellers, and they appear to be identical to Freud's premium router bits (but without the red paint). As such they can be an excellent bargain. You get a very nice Italian made bit for Chinese bit prices.Be warned, however, that this bit would more accurately be called a 1/4"" shank bit with a 1/2"" by 1"" cutter. The 2-5/8"" description is misleading at that refers to the entire bit length including the shank. For my purposes (at at the closeout bargain price), the 1"" cutter length is fine ... but be sure you know what you are getting."
negative,"...AND THE WORST BAND EVER AWARD GOES TO...: ...Unwritten law!!! This band has always been a terrible Pennywise wannabe and now they seem to be hellbent on sounding like every grunge-lite nu-rock band on the radio! I listened to the entire album online and all I heard was Creed, Fuel, Trapt, and every other terrible moron band one can think of. These dirtbike fanboy losers need to give it up and start a lame clothing company like SKIN already and stop poisoning the airwaves with their mediocre, copycat radio rock! Bottom line...this band sucks and so does anyone who thinks this Cd isn't a waste of the fossil fuels used to make the plastic that contains it!"
negative,"A story that wasn't for me: I consider myself a big King fan however this I will erase from my memory. I did find some parts of the book interested like the relationship of the friends, how they cared for Dudits and how they had all been friends for years. I loved the story until the guy with bad farts came along. I am not into aliens and do not find story lines along that nature very exciting but I thought King would pull it off. To me, it was just like any other Alien story... a bit more creative and gross but not anything I wanted to read. I didn't even finish the book because it was getting too ridiculous."
positive,"Great for Home Lab: This is great for creating a home lab, while more expensive than 3550's, the 3750's have many features that are not supported by the 3550. These switches allow you to use a QinQ tunnel and use the switch as a breakout switch with GNS3 saving you money in the long run (not needing to purchase physical routers)"
positive,Exactly as it happens in the office !!!!: Excellent performance of all actors. This movie is really similar to the regular life in the office. A lot of fun !!!
positive,Perfect: This account of Edison Marshall's own hunting experiences willmake you feel out of place in today's world. It captures a timenow gone.
positive,"Good support is hard to come by...: I have long been on the search for an affordable, high impact sports bra for well-endowed women...this is it!I am not a small chested woman(size DD cups)and I love high impact sports, but I have had a difficult time finding a sports bra that could keep me from painfully bouncing everytime I would run or jump. This bra keeps that from happening. I no longer feel pain when playing sports or running.I also don't feel as self-conscious when working out which is another added bonus.The bra is comfortable and supports my chest well. There is a hook-and-eye closure with a tab cover up that snaps in the back; which is part of the reason this bra can be so comfortable, look good, and have great support.I will continue to buy this product, as needed, in the future to keep me in my high impact sports."
negative,"Mostly motivational !: Good as a primer, there are others that are more detailed. But, buy & read all you can, cheaper than the smallest ""mistake""."
positive,STILL THE BEST: I have reviewed this album before and have not changed my mind at all - it is absolutely the best music out there. Clay has everything going for him. Eclectic - I and 8 other members of my family will join you in Glendale.
positive,"Solid work from a solid band!: 'First Under the Wire' is a very consistent and pleasing record. Assuming you like the LRB sound (I do, very much -- but they inspire loathing in some, a mystery to me unless those people hate melody, killer harmonies, and strong songwriting). I find it to be essentially a reworking of their previous album 'Sleepercatcher', with lots of 'matching' tracks. Cool Change=Sanity's Side, The Rumor=Shut Down Turn Off, Middle Man=Light of Day etc. That's not a problem for me though, because I love Sleepercatcher. I have to take issue with the reviewer who panned Mistress Of Mine, though... I think it's one of Glenn Shorrock's finest moments.Definitely one of LRB's high points."
positive,"What a breath of fresh air!: Marianne Curleys trilogy is a wonderful breath of fresh air in an over-crowded science fiction and fantasy world of Tolkien copycats and Harry Potter wannabees. Her books are completely original and innovative, all told through a real time first person narrative. I highly reccomend these books."
positive,Most Informative: This is the most informative series on Goju Ryu in print. Absolutely a must for all goju-ryu karate-ka.
negative,"Great idea--terrible design!: Bought this for my 5 year old Justice Leaguer. My son is not a rough player but we went through 4 (YES, FOUR) of them before we finally got one where the elevator didn't break in the 1st 2 weeks. Mattel needs to get their act together and design toys that have durability. VERY disappointing!"
positive,Excellent buy: In the past I charged my 3 batteries individually with a schumacher charger. Just installed this minnkota and I am already in love. The charger is all metal with good weight. I like how it looks and really appreciate having individual lights for each battery. Compared to the competition this was a no brainer. Other brands give 1-2 year warranty or lifetime that is pro rated (with some crazy equation that almost totals the cost of this charger). This has a 3 year warranty. This is another great product from minnkota and I expect I will have it a long time.
positive,"The best i've had thus far: This nutritional yeast is great over popcorn with a little sprinkle of olive oil! It is packed full of b-vitamins and amino acids: A definite super-food! Great value compared to my local store, where I'd have to pay the same price for only half the size. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective health food supplement."
negative,"Redefinition of LAME: I had low expectations and they still weren't met. My only satisfaction is that I didn't have to pay to see it on Amazon Instant Video but I'll never get my time back. Seriously, this movie has redefined LAME; bad acting, bad editing, bad script. If it weren't for the two little fuzzbots, it would have been a total loss. The ""stars"" who did this film must have had a bad round of luck in Vegas and desparately needed the money. Don't waste 2.5 hours of your life on this, especially when there is so much other less crappy stuff to watch!"
negative,"dont waste your time or money: these strips don't whiten your teeth AT ALL, even if they did the bottom strip only covers 6 teeth so you would look stupid with both white and yellow teeth when you smile. You should use trays and gel, it gives you great results and dosen't cost half as much as these strips....stay away!!!!"
negative,"Great suction, bad belts: Got this vacuum yesterday. Picks up exceptionally well. The belt has broken 3 times already when it sucks up things it shouldn't (the edge of a sheet, a tag from an area rug, and a shoelace). Seems a little ridiculous that the belt snaps so easily. They are cheap and pretty easy to replace, but it's a pain and I don't want to deal with returning to Amazon. Oh well."
negative,MADONNA PUSHING A GROCERY CART? RIIIIGGGHHHT!: I SAW THIS MOVIE ON MY WAY FROM SEATTLE TO TOKYO AND I WAS APALLED TO SEE TWO OF MY FAVORITE STARS LOOKING LIKE EVERYDAY PEOPLE. HODGE PODGE! THE STORY IS A GOOD STORY AND I LOVE THE WAY THIS MOVIE REFLECTS ON HOW HARD IT REALLY IS TO FIND SOMEONE YOU WANT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH BUT RUPERT AND MADONNA DON'T BELONG HERE. IT'S JUST NOT BELIEVABLE. THE ENDING NEEDED A LOT MORE AS WELL. A LOT MORE! I WOULD PUT SOMETHING IN FOR THE DVD BUT I HAVEN'T VIEWED IT AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE A DESIRE TO SINCE THIS MOVIE IS JUST BASIC HOLLYWOOD MUMBO JUMBO STARRING BIG NAMES.
negative,"JUST LIKE ANY OTHER: THIS PRODUCT IS CONVENIENT BUT ITS ALSO THE SAME AS ANY OTHER PRODUCT I HAVE USED. EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY'S BODY ACTS DIFFERENT, THIS WORKS THE SAME AS THE LIQUID FOR ME."
negative,Another made in china piece of junk: I just got this today to replace an Xacto that broke only after about 2 years of use. After sharpening just 3 pencils it was aparent that this shapener was not going to work right. All of the pencils were sharpened lopsided with wood remaining on one side of the point. Plus it will not sharpen any pencil under 3 inches since the cutters are set back so far in the case. The motor also sounds gritty and weak. Just another piece of crap made in China. I am getting so sick of this!! On a positive note this is the first thing I have ever had to return to Amazon.
negative,"train wreck on cable...: One has to wonder what good film wasn't made for this p.o.s. Too many cliches to count: every sister is an exec, every brother is a player.Some garbage has to be watched to see how bad it can be. I'm in the wrong business. Would have been made for tv except for all the swearing.Now to read the five-star hallucinations."
negative,"Poorly typset Kindle edition: I love this book, but it's a far better experience in print than in the Kindle edition. The book appears to have been transferred to electronic form with OCR and poorly proofread. Many of the alpha-numeric abbreviations are mangled and throughout the book you find tell-tale errors, like ""c"" for ""e,"" which leave you looking at nonsense words. Worst of all, in this case, are the myriad ""m"" for ""rn"" errors which turn almost every nautical use of ""stern"" into ""stem,"" which carries the opposite meaning and is truly confusing."
negative,"Great graphics, no story line, no point.: great if you like doing stupid tasks in a tony hawk style manner. only problem is the time clock is always ticking making this an arcade adventure rather than a video game. Don't waste the money, good graphics or not, this game is not entertaining."
negative,"Time Tried: TRIANGLE is one of those movies I can take or leave. It tries very hard to be original in plot but ultimately fails to really impress me. The ""time paradox"" or ""time loop"" is decent enough, but the film really does not scare or move me. I have to lump it into that group of films which I'm not sure I'm glad to have seen or not. I will give the film credit for all the reflection shots of the main character. Seeing her as double or even triple images really foreshadows the film. The acting was reasonably solid for the most part, but the story itself seemed to hopelessly grind on to the end."
positive,"Absolutely wonderful: This is a film I watched years ago in school as we were reading the novel. It has remained in my memories for over 15 years. When I found it on Amazon, I had to have it. The story is of extreme pain and extreme love. How far will the extremes go? how deep are the wounds of pain and how deep is the love that one man has for a woman he knows he can never have? how far will he go for her? this movie is very deep and emotional, one of the best Dicken's stories. This is a beautiful story, with beautiful actors and it is worth every minute."
positive,"Moving piece of literature...Vonnegut with another winner.: Mother Night is one of my favorite Vonnegut books, along with The Sirens of Titan and Hocus Pocus. It is different than the majority of his works, as Vonnegut does not rely on obvious comedy, or space travel. In this account of an accused Nazi war criminal, Vonnegut lets the reader deep within Campbell's mind, in order to allow the verdict to waver back and forth between guilty and not guilty. This is a brilliant novel, and it deals with issues deeper than Vonnegut lets on. A must for Vonnegut fans..."
positive,"Great Movie: This is a great movie, a bit sad in some places, but goes to show some people do have a heart when it comes to homeless people even if it is only a movie...Curly Sue"
negative,Buy from a different publisher!: There are key parts of this book missing. I was so confused about the story until I realized this. Get the book from a different publisher.
positive,"Hot Buy on a Cool Glass: I am so happy I found these glasses. They keep my beverages ice cold and the ice in the glass keeps for hours. Well worth the money, just sad you can't buy replacement inserts."
negative,"Stream-of-consciousness: His fragmentary thoughts are difficult to follow. There is some wisdom here and there, but not worth the headache you'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head. Here is an example:""If you say your own name to yourself at such a moment, it will seem utterly alien. You will then understand the sacrament of baptism."" Huh?At first, I thought his writing may just be over my head, but after re-reading most of it, I realized it was just bad. It's like the whole book was written when he was high or something. Some very good ideas, but most can be found in other, better written books."
positive,Pleasant read but nothing impressive: I pick this book for the holiday. The language is easy compared to the LOTR trilogy. Suitable for kid. Pleasant read. Just that the story line is plain and not addictive enough.
positive,"mana book: This book is great for all mana fans. It has the best of their songs from Falta Amor and Donde Jugaran los Niños albums. Songs are: Buscandola , como diablos, como te deseo, de pies a cabeza, estoy agotado, la chula , me vale, oye mi amor, perdido en un barco, rayando el sol, te llore todo un rio, and the best mana song ever VIVIR SIN AIRE.This book is worth buying, it is great!"
positive,"Very convienient: good coffee, no mess, lots of varietyeasy to make/grind your own beans with the k-cup ( you should use the modification and cut out an old use k-cup and place it in the tub to keep the water seaping a little bit longer.) Also you can re-use old k-cups about5-6 times with your own grinds. Both has been explained in the older reviews and works well for people who like stronger cups!"
positive,"Shubb partial capo: This is not a shortcut to alternate tuning. But it gives you the best of both alternate tuning and standard chord shapes that you already know. It is an awesome little capo that adds a lot of color to arrangements. It is a great purchase, well worth the price. Experiment and have fun!"
negative,"Boring: I thought this book was long, drawn out, and boring. It was too descriptive. To me, the writing style is a lot like Jane Eyre. I don't particularly like that type of book.Plus, it was way too sad and unrealistic. I don't think THAT many bad things could happen to one person."
positive,"Seems to work well...: It is definitely authentic guarana powder. Seems to give u a good caffeine amount. Only problem is it never seems to incorporate into your drink. I've tried using a blender, a spoon and even soaking it overnight in water but you always have to shake it before you drink it cuz it doesn't disolve. Tastes not bad with just water though."
negative,"Irresponsible!: What in the world was Jax Peters Lowell thinking when she wrote Chapter 17, ""Rx for Health""? I cannot begin to express the fear and anxiety I felt when I saw Celebrex named as a drug that contains gluten. I stopped taking it immediately and began searching for a gluten-free alternative. I was so upset that all of my efforts as a celiac to live gluten-free were being undermined by my Celebrex. I had thought it was gluten-free! I found the website that Lowell mentions on page 394, Glutenfree Drugs.com, hoping to find a gluten-free alternative pain medication. Imagine my relief at seeing Celebrex on the list. I contacted Pfizer....no gluten! I Googled gluten and Celebrex.....NO Gluten! There are many responsible guides for celiacs. Lowell's book is certainly not one of them!"
negative,Water does not taste good: My son recently gave me a B70 Keurig coffee maker. I'm a tea drinker but appreciated the fact that I could brew coffee for friends. I have notmade one cup of coffee..but I have heated water for tea. I find that it does not taste good. The water has a plastic smell. Will this go away after more use? Has anyone else experienced this? I realize if you're using it for coffee you would never taste it.
negative,"Scratched disk: Disk 4 was scratched and so I couldn't watch 2 episodes, I tried cleaning the disk but that didn't work. All episodes were on the disks but there was also a disk 6 that had episodes from a different season, so I believe that these are fake."
positive,"AMAZON.COM IS BEING UTTERLY IRRESPONSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!: I don't understand how Amazon.com can allow ""reviews"" with vulgarities and obvious intentions to slam the artist rather than reviewing the cd, to be posted. Is this how Amazon.com wants to be portrayed? Trashy because it allows trashy ""reviews"" to be posted. This is outright irresponsibility especially when children may visit this site!Why does Amazon.com even bother to state ""Please be sure to focus your comments on the album's content. Read our review guidelines for more information"" when it isn't responsible enough to check before it allows posts of this dispicable nature to be put up. I am deeply disappointed!Having said all that Clay's Measure of a Man is an excellent cd and no intentional slams of Clay or his cd will make fans of Clay to change their minds. In fact, I know of many people who are not even fans of Clay and they love this cd. A great cd is a great cd, period."
negative,"Item picture is not representative of what you will actually receive: The speaker is great, but it looks nothing like the picture included with the item description. There is really nothing about that photo that is even remotely similar. I don't know if I got an earlier version of this speaker or what. Amazon really needs to correct the photo on this item."
negative,"Ummmmm. . . . . Beautiful Jacket, I guess: Before I begin, I have to give a nod to the author who, after all, is only 19 years old. If any of my students wrote this well, I'd be very impressed. That said, I still don't think young Paolini is anywhere near ready for publishing, and I'm frankly a little confused as to both how and why this book was accepted and marketed so lavishly.The plot line is predictable, the diaglogue trite, and the writing style very clearly that of a beginner. I read to page 200, hoping and hoping that something would happen to justify the glowing reviews featured on the dust cover. Unfortunately, nothing did, and I just can't make myself go on. This book may interest very young teens (although in our post-Harry Potter world, perhaps not), but otherwise, I would caution against wasting either the money or the time."
negative,"Lord of the flies: William Golding wrote a good book contrasting two types of war. Boys are stranded on an island after a plane crash. They are challenged to face a number of opsticals, including death. The time set is during WWII."
negative,BE WARNED: DOES NOT WORK: Do not order this DVD. It does not work. The HD player will tell you that it cannot load it (error message) after 10 minutes of trying. Looks like everyone else has had this problem as well. I called Amazon for a refund and recommended that they pull this item. It DOES NOT PLAY.
negative,"Favorite movie ever!: This is a great movie, right from the beginning there is music and singing some of the best songs I've ever herd this movie has great costumes and performances , and vivid color ,I give it 5 stars!."
positive,"One Of Shirley's Most Touching Films: Some people have said this is Shirley Temple's best film. It's not my favorite but I admit it is very good....and it has some of the most touching, wonderful moments of any of her films.The mean old lady, ""Fraulein Rottenmeier,"" played by Mary Nash, has too big a role in the second half of the movie making for a number of unpleasant scenes. I had gotten so involved with the story that I couldn't stand to see this mean woman so nasty to ""Heidi"" (Temple). Also, there was only one song-and-dance number and that's not enough for a Shirley Temple movie, in which we come to expect songs-and-dances.The other characters were fine. Arthur Treacher provides good humor; Jean Hersholt is great as the gruff-then-loving grandfather and Marcia Mae Jones is nice as the young invalid.This is a true classic story and ends with perhaps the most gorgeous and sweetest smile I've ever seen on Shirley's face."
positive,Handheld Shower Head not so hot...: I tried and tried to install this new shower head but the bracket was apparently defective. All it would do is leak from the main bracket. But Conair Corp is very good in honoring their warranty and I should have my replacement soon!The fact that the main bracket that connects it to the shower pipe is plastic instead of metal and is rounded instead of hexagonal (having six sides) is also quite disappointing; but I will lose less money by the exchange than if I tried to return it for a refund.
negative,"THIS WILL MAKE YOU THINK: I AM 22 AND FOR ABOUT 7 YEAR I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE CLOCK WORK ORANGE MOVIE, I HAD BEEN DESCRIBED PARTS OF THE MOVIE AND WAS VERY INTERESTED BY THE MOVIE.ONE I HAD FINISHED WATCHING THE MOVIE I FOUND THIS TO BE BIZZAAR, BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT IN ITS DAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD MOVIE.PREWARNING:- BE PREPARED FOR RAPE AND VIOLENCE AND IF YOU LIKE THE SONG 'SINGING IN THE RAIN' IT WILL CHANGE YOU VEIW ON THE SONG FOREVER.BUT IF YOU HAVENT SEEN IT I WOULD RECOMMEND TO DO SO."
negative,"Errate almost as big as the book: I just printed this book's errata, which is 14 pages long. Then I took a pencil and tried to correct all the errors in the book - well at least all the errors that are mentioned in the errata.While this is probably the best book available to get ready for the SCWCD exam,14 pages of errata is a lot. This book if full of errors and should be recalled.I completely lost my trust in the publisher (Manning) and don't consider them anymore when buying books.Go and get an O'Reilly book - they actually do review 'em - even before they go to print."
positive,"so Kurt, how do you really feel about the war?: Man, if any of his books really reflects his views on war, government, and patriotism, this one leads the pack. He lays the satire on pretty thick. Unlike _Bluebeard_, he handles the fictional biography idea well. The book is structured very nicely. Like _Bluebeard_ though, he provides one of the more satisfying conclusions to his story. Many of his books are weak when the end hits."
negative,This DVD should be sent to Boot Hill: This quality of this DVD was terrible. I got it as part of the Trinity 3 pack and I am extremely dissapointed. The 2 others are fine. Boot Hill looks as if someone sat inside a cinema and recorded it from the screen with a 8mm camera in 1970 then completely messed up the editing to boot. Don't buy this or the Trinity 3 pack. If you want the two others thye are also available as a combo. Complete waste of money. I suppose at one time this might have been some kind of movie but this is not.
negative,"Can't be that great.: I saw this film at a special screening in the late 1970's at an art house cinema in Minneapolis. The film did not leave a lasting impression on me, unlike some of the other films I saw around the same time frame. I can hardly remember a single detail about it. Its not like me to get amneisia about a film, especially if it is trully a great work of art. But since I can barely recall having seen Last Tango, it leaves me with the impression that this film is not a great work of art as the urband legand makers would have it."
negative,"Big Movie - But Big Waste of Time !!: This is a rewrite of my 'Batman Begins' review, which i just wanted to make shorter and more to the point-****Don't believe all the exaggerated publicity regarding this movie.This has to be one of the most over-rated films i've ever seen.Yes, the movie has a big quality to it - it is over-produced and heavy-handed. Watching it was a real drag. Just because a movie has a big feel and look to it, doesn't mean its great.Anyway, to me 'Batman Begins' was a tiresome waste of time and as phony as Batman's hoarse voice. (sounds like in the movie he may have a cold - so instead of pop corn, you may want to have a few cough drops on hand if you decide to watch this).but i would skip this one.peace out & cheers!-CrowTurtle"
positive,Classic: This movie staring our now beloved actors and actresses is still one of the best made movie.. The 60s was an era were life as we knew it changed. this movie brought ought every thing.Awesome movie
negative,"Disappointing w/ meager story: This was not a good film. The premise is less interesting than it sounds and the thin strands of story aren't plausible or that interesting. While the acting was ok (not great) and there were some attractive men on screen, it just wasn't a good enough storyline to be interesting. The central event that provides the conflict for the plot is somewhat confusing and the connection of the two lovers not believable.I think this studio can do better."
positive,"Great Story, Entertaining Flick: Intriguing story, good acting and dynamic characters makes this an entertaining flick. The honest glimpse into our world of complex relationships is rewarding. If you have religious hangups (as the 1-star reviewers obviously do) don't watch -- the film challenges simplistic views regarding sex and relationships."
positive,"Something special: This is a great album including pop and some rock elements, combined with a sweet recognizable voice. Each song has its special thing and the duets harmonize in every way. The origin is no doubt the Spanish linguistic zone, but at no time there is too much of Spanish guitars or any other cliché. Short, this is an intelligent mixture.Towards the end there is a fantastic increase which I had not expected. The sound is harder, guitars are more dominant. There are two additional tracks, which are worth buying the full album.Ultimately the collaboration with Francesco Sondelli is something special, what means that Shery is able to convince in Italian language, even if only for one song.Hopefully we hear more of this special Guatemalan singer. This is not a CD for one's time is needed: It yearns to be heard once again, from the beginning."
positive,"Male/Male USB Cable: the cable arrived in pristine condition. It was packaged and protected well. I have not been able to use it yet, but I don't expect any problems."
negative,"The Antidote to Men are from Mars...: This book should come with a coupon for Hagen Daas, because you're going to end up on the sofa eating comfort food and wondering what went wrong. I read this book. I laughed in all the right places, but then I made a terrible mistake. I took Sherry Argov's advice seriously. My marriage was good, but this book made me think I was getting shortchanged. So I took the leap and took control. Now I'm in marriage counseling and wondering if I'm going to be able to hang onto my husband. I did get one thing right, though. After eleven years of wonderful marriage, I managed to get my husband to call me a bitch. I'm trying to get him to believe that I'm in a midlife crisis. Because I can't bring myself to say that I destroyed a great relationship because of something that sounded good in a book."
positive,Lincoln and his time: For the mpost part any book by David Donald is worth the time and effort to read. This book offers fresh insights into the perception of Lincoln. Belongs on the shelf of every person interested in 19th century America.
positive,GREAT MOVIE: WHAT A DELIGHT TO WATCH!AND THE PERIOD SETTING AND COLOR AND PRODUCTION WERE WONDERFUL! LOVED IT!
negative,"Real ingredients not listed: The real ingredients is not listed by amazon. After buying the product, I found that it contains Tuna oil (source of DHA). This should have been mentioned by Amazon, and they are refusing when I requested refund. Disappointed in Amazon customer service for the first time."
positive,Fire alone: Schocking! I am 10 years old and I love it I have read all of the series! A must read! I really love it and I cant wait for the other books come out! You need to read this book!
positive,A Good Read and Typical Hornblower: If you like sea novels and if you like the Hornblower series then you'll like this book. It's typical Hornblower and invokes thoughts of a long gone age of adventure on the high seas. Enjoy the complete series...
positive,"Very nice: I loved this DVD. It was funny and touching at times (especially the cast member's tribute to Robert Reed). I had never heard of a ""Super 8 camera"" before, so I enjoyed seeing what it could do and the quality of it was really good. The whole content of this DVD was absolutely wonderful and the stories to go along with it were equally funny and touching."
positive,"Funny Movie....: When I went to see this movie, I knew it was a funny movie, with great visual effects.... but many people went expecting to see a horror movie... they were dissapointed of course. Just think of it as a good funny movie, with some creepy scenes and very good special effects (the ""skin"" effects are excellent). The ""Building a Better Mummy"" documental is very good too."
negative,Second brewer and same problem: My second brewer is not working( the first was replaced very efficiently under warranty by keurig when it did the same thing after a few months). This one has lasted long enough to be out of warranty. The brewer short cups and then shuts down -the same problems others are describing here. I decided to check reviews before deciding on another brewer and am actually relieved I am not the only one having this problem but I love the variety of k cups available and will have a hard time turning away from this product. I will not buy another one tho and will wait to see if the company comes out with a reliable machine.Back to a regular coffee maker for the time being.
negative,"Heidi, starring Shirley Temple: I rented this 88 min. long DVD. Very disappointed that it did not tell the same story I remember seeing as a child. It seems that Paramount has cut the original so that much of the character building scenes are no longer present. That is what really made the story of Heidi have an impact. If I had never seen it before I would be sorely disappointed in the story. As it is now, I am only disappointed in what has been done to the movie. If anyone knows of a full length version that is available, I am there! Could it be the one referred to by your other reviewer (Jake Marsico) that Fox has done?"
negative,"Start Over Swede: Routine tread through familiar territory. The camera work is not a pastiche of 70's photography, unless you seriously think every picture of that decade was directed by Micheal Winner. The photography is an entirely contemporary fad and an irritant.The ending. No, no, no."
negative,"great....while it lasted.: It had great suction for the first couple of months but then it started to gradually lose that strength - but we found nothing causing any blockage. The retractable cord is a pretty nifty feature but I sort of loss track of that when wrestling with the top handle that kept coming loose from the base- due to screw coming undone. It's rather bulky. We tried to find a replacement screw but were unsuccessful. Then it just up and stopped working in the middle of cleaning the other day. It wouldn't turn on. We've had it much less than a year. Complete bummer. I don't recommend.We give two stars for extra long hose, a good effort on suction(the noise makes you ""feel"" like you're driving a mustang when your suction is a pinto) and retractable cord nifty add-on thingie ---what can I say I like the sparklies ;)"
positive,"Ordered battery operated, got plug in: works fine. Easy to install. Discreet. Directions were easy to understand. We got this because we have a gas fireplace and wanted to be safe. I ordered a battery operated alarm because I wanted more options of where to place it other than being commited to an electrical outlet. However, what was shipped was the electrical kind. I decided to keep it because you know the hassle of returning wasn't worth it and it does it's job."
positive,joy of origami: It has given me a lot of good helps with this hobby. You can proceed at your own speed. I would recommend it to anyone interested in origami
negative,"Nice pictures.: This book was a huge disappointment. It's the stuff that fairy tales are made of - not science, of any sort. The pictures ARE fascinating but I was looking for much more substance.Skip this one!"
negative,"No disrespect to SOAD fans but I cannot get into these guys: System of a Down's Toxicity has to be one of the worst albums I ever heard in the last five years.I bought it on a whim back in April of 2002 as everyone was telling me this album was amazing to see what the fuss what about of these guys.The songs like Chop Suey, the title cut, Ariels, Prison Song and the rest are all the same nu-metal poor me, I hate my life garbage which was immortalized by lame groups like Linkin Park, Korn and especially Limp Bizkit.The stupid singer and the guitarist are whining and screaming like 2-year olds that didn't get what they wanted.If you like metal, I recommend you get some good old school metal instead, like Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Motorhead, Judas Priest and the one and only Van Halen."
negative,Not this time Robyn: Tired and lacking.Feels like he had nothing to say but had a record due. A few moments here and there but overall lacks any memorable tunes. Everybody can lay a fat egg and Robyn is human. Thank god for Moss Elixer.Avoid as a starting place but any Hitcher will eventually own it.
negative,"Really Confusing: I use this text for an AP Computer Science course, and find it to be one of the most confusing books on the topiic of Java and Computer Science. Being in multiple APs, I obvisouly cannot read every single word and frequently have to sort out what information is relevant in a book. In most of my textbooks, this is rather easy. Horstmann's book is, however, quite the exception. The author literally interupts his own sentences and sections with dozens of ""Random facts,"" ""Productivity Hints,"" ""Advanced Topics,"" and many more of these callouts. One chapter, I forget which one, actually has three of these strung in a row, manking this book incredibly hard to read. After cutting out in the middle of a topic, it is very common to just, without warning, start back up five pages later. Avoid this book."
negative,"watch a test pattern instead: I paid good money for this thing so i can say what i like.This movie is suppose to put bond movies to shame,mission:failure.It copies every thing from those movies and still bites the big one.I love pointless action and unbelievable stunts but these are plain stupid.The only reason to watch is asia argento and her tattoo mmmmmmmm.vin diesel cant save this junk."
positive,Great film for kids: I remember watching this movie as a kid and I loved it then and I still love it now. I think that it deals with a lot of themes that are appropriate for all ages. It is also good for adults too because it is entertaining. I love the older version of the series as well.Definitely would recommend this movie for everyone
positive,"Alone by Yourselves: Stranded on an island alone as a twelve year old; how would you survive? That's the question author William Golding poses to us in his adventure novel ""Lord of the Flies"". While escaping WWII in England, a plane of British school boys is shot down, and they suddenly find themselves alone on a deserted island with no parental supervision. Now completely alone, the boys begin to assemble on the beach with the help of a determined young boy, Ralph. You will follow the power struggle between two twelve year olds from beginning to end, who both want to take charge of all the children on the island. Soon the boys take sides, and begin to form two separate tribes, and the attention is deviated away from the major goal, getting off the island. This book will hold your attention throughout with the impending question on your mind; will they make it off, and back to safety? Golding does an exceptional job of creating an action thriller that you won't put down until the very last page."
positive,"I liked the book because...: I liked the book Castle In The Attic because it was a book on a Dragon and a Knight. My three favorite parts were when William climbed the tree and got the apple for the cursed man. My other one was when he fought the dragon,and my last one was when William fought Alastor.Other kids should read this book so they will be more interested in reading the sequel Battle For The Castle."
negative,"Disappointing Follow up .........: The book is definately a disappointing follow-up from Mail Order Bride. Its so hard to like Annie, who is out for herself and very immature. Usually in historical romances a 20 year old is a little more mature. So it makes it difficult to root for her and Colin, when all you want to do is smack her in the head.I love Maureen McKade's books, and I would tell you to read this, just to get closure from the whole Trevelyan tale. But man oh man, Kate and Trev raised a brat!!!!!! I expected way better. Sorry, Ms. Mckade..."
negative,"Review of Marty Robbins Gunfighter Ballads and trail Songs: This is a classic recording of Marty Robbins. Unfortunately, the copy that was sent to me does not play properly, with many skips and pauses on almost all of the tracks. I would return it if your company policy allowed it."
positive,Kung-fu fun: This movie is better than I thought .... It's more Kung-fu comedy than anything. Usualy the charactor Wong Fei-Hung is a bit to serious and stiff. To see him in a comedic setting is quite refreshing and him dressed in a chicken suit fighting the centipede was hilarious. I enjoyed it so much that it's now a part of my Jet Li movie collection. The man is a versatile actor and very good martial artist.
negative,review mni magnetic s& p set: Neither the salt mill or pepper grinder work well. It takes forever to get salt and pepper from the squeezing of the handles together and still not an adequate amount. Perhaps the blades that crunch the S&P are not sharp enough? Very disappointed in product.
positive,Very Good Flavor.: The Hazelnut flavor is very good but could be stronger. I actually add two tablets to a #2 cone filter when brewing coffee. I find this is better than adding the tables to an already brewed cup of coffee.
positive,Cheaper by the dozen not the movie: It was written in a time that was really trying to point out the ways to save time and money. Nothing like the movie by the same name.
positive,"My cats love this.: My cats love this product. The slightest whiff of it causes them to beg with frantic meows. This is a great product if you'd like to train your cat(with a clicker and a pointer). It's a lot of money for 21oz of chicken though, so it loses one star :("
positive,"From A Music Teacher!: This film is outstanding, but I can't imagine the general public liking this movie. I'm in the classical music world and understand the music conservatory life. All the acting is wonderful. I would say not to watch this movie if you really don't know the music world and not like kinky stuff. I do understand why some people get bored with this. But to me I can really feel how my life would be over if my teacher put glass in my coat pocket to injure my hands so I'll never play again! That was the most terrible part for me to watch!Trust your own judgement. If you don't like the plot, the music is beautiful and they use great musicians."
negative,"I don't know, maybe it's just me. I didn't laugh.: I love comedies that are cleverly made. 'Dodgeball' had all of the SNL ingredients and that's what made it old. The concept of a movie based on the game of dodgeball is brilliant, it just wasn't executed right. This could have been a marriage made in heaven with Ben Stiller and a 'Rocky'-type ending. But there's no emotion here and the jokes are stale 90's retro. How many times do you have to throw in a 'lesbian' joke or mock Asian people? I would be ashamed to even be associated with a movie that puts down people who are in the minority.Yes, the film did great at the boxoffice, but so what? The crowd went to see Ben Stiller and the concept of dodgeball. I think this film brought the American comedy to yet another low. Will someone please bring back the great American comedy?"
positive,"one of the best!: Of course The Hobbit isn't as good as The Lord of the Rings, but still I think it's one of the best books ever written! I strongly suggest you read it!"
positive,"Great Girl: To the Wow person: You think it was a treat to see Rebecca live?!? I had her teach a few songs to us at my birthday party, and she's a student director at my choir; I see her each week! I didn't know she was so respected! She is an amazing player. Her CD is great, too. She plays with a lot of expression. Really--buy the CD! It is great, Rebecca is great!Vegan Violin Person who Loves Crochet heehee"
negative,"Great Book--just don't buy this edition: This is a great book and would rate 4-5 stars. However, this version is a 'print on demand' type reprint. The quality of paper is good but the font is very small AND the text is pushed together: there is not much space between lines and there is NO spacing between chapters (where usually it would start on new page). The end result is a great book that is hard to read."
negative,"Not as well-made as I'd hoped: The three bears on this toy spin easily, which makes it great for a young baby to play with. Each of the bears are rattles and are not only interesting to watch but noisy too. However, the suction cup doesn't work very well, even when moistened. I used to put it on our baby's swing tray, and then her high chair tray, but it never stuck for long and would fall over. Obviously it's quite top-heavy, so it's not a toy that is made to be HELD and played with.Occasionally I will still try it on her high chair tray but now she's strong enough that (because it doesn't stick well) she can knock it to the floor. Mostly it just sits in her toy box and doesn't get any play.My recommendation? If you're looking for a suction cup toy, try something else. Overall, this one just isn't worth it."
negative,"Lame attempt to make a great movie: I was expecting a lot more out of this movie then what I got.It's basically about a girl who lost her short-term memory in an auto-moblie accident and some guy tries to get her to fall in love with him, yadda, yadda, yadda...There was a lot of jokes that fell flat on their backs' in this movie, after awhile it really begins to annoy you.The acting is nothing great and the diolouge is flat-out horrible.Sandler doesn't give a good performance and Barrymore is okay.Basically, it's a repeatitive movie that delivers lame jokes and the same thing every ten minutes.If you're looking for a good movie, look elsewhere.This is a very lame, unfunny, boring and stupid movie. Save your money for something worthwhile."
positive,Makes me feel younger and more energetic: Great on any food that has a salty taste. I don't recommend on cereal or sweet things like in shakes.
negative,didn't work for my dog: This seemed to have no effect on my dog. He has severe separation anxiety and nothing seems to work. Oh well.
negative,"No: The writer of this film should be killed, and every copy of it should be burned. This is by far the worst film I have ever forced myself to sit through, aside from The Blair Witch Project 2. It's horrible."
positive,"Satisfied: The replacement battery and cover were exact match to the original battery. The price, quick delivery and the new battery performance gave new life to my older phone."
negative,"BORING...: The information was worthwhile, but I found this video to be blah and boring. If you are going to bother to make a documentary at least make it somewhat entertaining! Add some interesting visuals and use a narrator that catches your attention. Read a book on this subject and by-pass this DVD."
positive,"Favorite Gift: I got this as a gift for my brother-in-law, who is a fan. He was so excited!! I also got him the Ani DiFranco: Knuckle Down CD. He was a happy camper!"
positive,Great magazine: Terrific magazine. Great way to keep up with current trends in jazz. Been reading this magazine since 1964. Use it quite a bit to discover new music to listen to.
negative,"Disappointing...: I bought this CD after hearing ""Ashes by Now""...love that song but the rest are boring. I was hoping there would be more songs like that on the CD. Most are slow, sleepy, depressing songs. She has a beautiful voice, which comes through on this CD, but that still doesn't making it worth listening to more than once."
positive,"Great Read: I purchased this book and was glued to it until I finished it. And once I finished it, I was sad. I wish there were more. I also purchased the dvd but didn't enjoy that as much as the books. Stick to the books. If you love zombie books, you will definitely love this book. I recommend to anyone who loves zombies."
positive,"A child's adventure story; an adult's classic: It's too easy to dismiss Heinlein's juveniles as books for kids. Too easy, and too simplistic. As a kid, this was my favorite book about adventures in space. I just re-read it, and was amazed at the depth of presentation in a book easily enjoyed by children. The Venusian frame of mind is both alien and understandable. The ideas of boys becoming men, confused and excited by their new surroundings is real. And the approach to civic duty that a young officer learns, and his total inability to explain it to some civilians, is heart-breakingly real."
negative,"all is not well in Fusion land: Gillette has a quality control problem with the blades. This is a recent problem, but it nonetheless has caused me to swithch to Schick disposable razors. The Gillette problem has to do with the blue strip on the razor face. The blue strip degrades after only a few shaves, and then it actually leaves a blue residue on your face."
negative,"Outdated Advice: The advice itself is outdated and not useful, however the general principal will never be obsolete. Save what you can, work hard and don't live outside your means. I'll try the Modern American Frugal Housewife instead."
positive,"Like it, but watch out for color.: I liked it overall - always great Mikasa quality, just wanted to warn others, that advertised ""crisp white background"" came in rather milky-creamy-off-white color. Definitely not white."
negative,not a good choice: this camera is great as a toy or for children to practice with. The software is also pretty nice and lets you do quit a bit of editing. the photos though are terrible. usually they ave a blue or brown cast to them and even on a tripod the images blur. not recommended for saving photo memories.
negative,"No, no D'Onofrio: Not a great movie. Vincent D'Onofrio is my FAVORITE actor, but his acting skills are wasted on this movie. Cannot recommend this poor movie."
negative,"never buy it again: use it as not using, the diaper even broke on the side...... never buy it again!!!!! it make skin rash, . babd bad bad !!!"
negative,"Usher is HUSHED...: When I first heard the song "" U remind me"" on the radio I went and bought the CD. The CD is a waste of time and money. First of all the songs are really really boring. And to top it all he can't sing!! I think Usher should hire new writers and should learn how to sing. His songs are tacky and meanigless, plus his videos are really dumb. I advise you NOT to buy this album, instead go and check out the new Jessica Simpson album "" Irrsistible"". Now that is music!"
negative,fix formatting in kindle version: The equations are incomplete and it becomes very hard to read. Have tried on multiple devices. mathematical formatting is not complete. Very disappointing. Particularly the bras and kets.
positive,Great fun and adventure: The charactors Kept me laughing and on the edge of my seat. And Richard Chamberlain is plain hot.
positive,"What Went Wrong At Enron: The author makes a complicated area accessible to the general public in a careful, thoughtful way without distracting from the readibility; a masterful performance."
negative,"Technical book written by someone who does not know how to write a technical book.: It is too bad that this is practically the only one of the kind. The aim is great, the contents are great, but the author does not know how to write a technical book. The author refers to concepts and terms that are yet to be defined or never defined at all. For example, at the very beginning, the author talks about ""violet"" and ""purple"". Am I the only one who did not know ""violet"" means a color of a single frequency, whereas ""purple"" is a color of combined frequencies? This is a No-No for mathematicians and scientists. For those of who are already familiar with Color Theory, the book must be a great assurance, articulation or enhancement of their existing knowledge, but for those who are new and try to learn as an artist, this is a nightmare. I am the latter kind. The only reason I could finish it was because I am familiar with fundamental physics and optics already."
negative,The Hound: The name of my book is Hound of The Baskervilles. In this book the main character is sir Charles Baskervilles. He is a very important man then one night he dies. But he was found dead out side during his evening walk. So it is up to Sherlock Holmes to find out if this was caused to natural causes or it was rough play. Sherlock has little time to solve the mystery before chaless nephew receives his place as a rich tycoon.Idid not like this book and do not suggest this to anyone.
positive,The best thing i've ever listened to.: I just want to say that this cd has brought a remarkable insiration in my life. There are so many words to explain it that i cant possibly think of. They shed light on girls around the world who are scared to let out who they are and what they beleive in. Anyone who is everyone should buy this cd just to experience a little on the wild side. And if your Russian I'm sure you know what I mean. Please go buy this cd and make T.A.T.U a worldwide favorite.
positive,"WONDERFUL: I Love this CD. She is a great witness and all of her songs a great.Ride(9/10)very catchyDon't look at me(15/10)I love this song. It is definitely one of my favroites.O.O Baby(7/10)a little hard to understand but still good.Without Love(10/10)A song with a great tune and a great message.Stay True(20/10)my favroite Stacie Orrico song (you have to hear it to understand, but trust me its great)Genuine(10/10)A song that is genuinely great. A really great sound.With a little Faith(9/10)A good message and it's fun.So Pray(10/10)a great message. It is bold but she does a great job with it. I LOVE it.Holdin' On(9/10)really fun words and a great message!Restore my Soul(8/10)a lot like Holdin' On. Not as up-beatConfidant(10/10) I Love the tune and words.Everthing(6/10)Sweet but not very catchy.Dear Friend(13/10)A song that came from her heart and she wrote it her self which I really admire."
positive,"A classic, revisited after many years: I read the John Carter Martian Series all the way through in my adolecent years, and have always maintained fond memories of the stories. I recently decided to download them to my Kindle and read them again. I was amused at first by the writing (written almost exactly 100 years ago now), not so much for the phrases and words (though they are amusing at times) but the style and the way the characters are portrayed. This is truly a peek at the sensibilities of an older age.However, once you get over (or used to) the over romanticized hero, to whom no danger raises so much as an eyebrow, you will live (or re-live) a classic tale that is nicely told. It is fun as a middle aged adult to again read these stories, suspend all disbelief and scientific knowledge, and just enjoy them for what they are! John Carter made a permanent imprint on me as a kid, and I'm glad to see that it remains still."
positive,"Not classic, but Inspiring haiku, bringing art into everyday: I received this book as a gift from a friend a couple of years ago which inspired our circle of friends to start our own little haiku challenge. The poetry in this book is a collection of snippets from the lives of ordinary but creative people. It proves that everyone can find a little bit of revelation in their lives, in things as simple as a map or mist rising in the cold. And by sending those little snippets to friends they stayed as much a part of each others lives as if they were right next door. I really recommend dipping into this collection and maybe even starting your own haiku challenge...it isn't meant to be classic haiku, but simply enlightenment in daily life, given with love from one friend to another."
negative,"Leaks, leaks, leaks!: This are horrible for newborns. We had one on and not only did it leak through the diaper, but her clothes, blanket, and on to what she was sitting on. So gross. I won't buy these again. This is what I would expect from a cheap knockoff brand not a name brand. Don't make the mistake of buying this for a newborn.They also don't have the indicator strip, so you have to open to see which is frustrating for a newborn. Pay a little more for swaddlers or huggies because they are a waste of money. I'm donating them to a shelter or something because we can't use these."
negative,"I Stopped Reading It: A friend recommended this book as something that would encourage ""logical"" belief in God. I doubt he read it himself, first.Most of the claims he makes are based on assumptions, which makes for very frustrating reading."
negative,breaks easily and has bad warrenty: the warrenty on this device is only 3 months and it breaks quite quickly. the cover kept popping off and when it broke creative said the warrenty ran out
negative,"Cheap: This was a gift, but the fabric was cheap and didn't look great on or last well. However It was fun, and I got compliments on it all night."
negative,"It's Kind of a Tragic Story: Any story whose premise is the would be suicide of a teenager is rather too cynical to be saved by dark humor. I'm not one to take things too seriously to see the humor in everyday life; in fact I consider doing so to be humans' best coping mechanism. But this movie falls prey like so many others these days to the urge to drastically overstate its thesis lest the slow-witted fail to grasp it. You can't start with miserable and strive for sardonic irony. You can start with sardonic irony and strive for humor, sure, but going waaaay too dark from the start makes it impossible to be lighthearted to the grown-ups out there. Think the difference between Little Miss Sunshine and One Flew Over Cuckoos Nest: this is trying for the former and nailing the latter but without the social commentary. No upside here."
positive,Helping me with my 2 year old!: I am finally figuring out how to do deal with my 2 year old thank the heavens for this book!!!
negative,"flashlight: needs a lot of shaking to keep it going. once you do shake it a bit the light is bright, but still not the greatest product."
positive,"Excellent Book: Given the scope and intent of this book, W. J. Wood does an excellent job. Particularly significant is his dispelling many myths about the weaponry and tactics that won the war. The introduction is extremely valuable. This is a must-have for any beginning or intermediate level student of the period."
positive,"Great watch: Its a great watch for one with a smaller wrist. I have the Storm which has served me well since 1996 (which i hope they can repair, with a new batterry). I wear it every day doing heavy duty Construction Reno's after my years of Diving. These are serious watches (whether diving/swimming or doing serious outdoor activities). An active outdoor guy watch"
positive,"A must read for Cold War fans: Anyone interested in the Cold War should definitely get this book from their local library. Clearly aimed at a broad audience, it offers a brilliant account of how ideology and pragmatism affected the decision makers of power brokers and statesmen on both sides of the divide. It also changed my perspective on world geopolitics from a more disengaged and naive view to a more realistic one. A must read for Cold War fans!"
negative,"Absolutely horrible.: This is by far the worst movie I have ever watched. Perhaps it is realistic if you live in inner city New York, or Chicago, but the majority of the world does not live like this. And there are very few teenagers that have the maturity to watch this and not think it's ""cool"" to do these things. This movie was all about shock value. And it looks like it served its purpose."
negative,Unstable causes sytem to crash in Mac OS 9 and 10: This product is a rip-off. It causes your system to be unstable and crash. I tried it using Mac OS 9.2.2 and 10.2.8.
positive,"Video below standard: Although the video left a lot to be desired, the plot is a true reproduction of the book, which remains one of the best novels I ever read. This is a very hard item to procure, and I am grateful to the people who have made it available."
positive,"Inside view of Iraqi Kurds: This is one of those rare books that one finds by someone ""on the ground"" who writes accurately as well as entertainingly. A story of road building through one of the most interesting ""remote areas "" of the region, building on both history as well as the culture, but especially the incredible feat of putting in a vital road, still in use today and using only local labor. For those of us (Westerners) who have lived there, it is difficult to find writers who resurrect our emotions so vividly of the people and cultural interrelationships as this Scottish road builder. It is a gem."
positive,"Great for your kids!: We bought our ocean wonders aquarium when my son was just a few months old, and he loved it. Every night when we put him to sleep he would ""start"" his music and listen to it until he nodded off. When he woke up in the middle of the night, he would push the button for the lights and music and he would be soothed back to sleep. Sometimes we wouldn't even have to get up to resettle him, which was wonderful! He wore his aquarium out, so when his little sister was born, she got her own. She's going to be two years old this month and she still plays with it at every nap and bedtime. The music playing becomes almost ""ritualistic"", so don't let it run out of batteries!We've never regretted this purchase, and haven't had any problems with its' durability, although after about a year the motion part of the toy stopped working for some reason. It doesn't seem to bother my daughter, so we just left it alone because the music and the 'bubbling' still work.I highly recommend this toy!"
negative,"Good Times Video...Skip it: What Dean & Jerry fan does not know of this movie?My intention is to save those of us collectors time and money.The Good Times Video version appears to have been recorded from a vhs - that was itself recorded from another vhs without Time Base Correction - about 10 times.It's presented as Academy Standard 1.37:1 (original film aspect)Yep - that bad. Perhaps it was better than nothing, but now that something has hit the market, do yourself a favor, skip this version."
negative,"LOL!: This movie shows how liberal thinking, attitudes and behavior all turn into trouble, the abuse of others, and personal destruction. This is at best a ""Lifetime"" style movie and demonstrates the epic fail that is liberalism."
negative,"2 units quit working after about a year :(: When it works, it is a good unit. It is very expensive per cup. The parent company owns most of the many brands available for the machine so you get many choices of mostly very average at best coffee. The many choices let you think you'll eventually get a great coffee, but **sigh** you wont find the best beans in the greenmountain or keurig parent owned coffees. The coffee you will get will however make lots of money for keurig. Having said that, it is really fast for a fresh cup of coffee, and works good at making quick tea. You can use the large size setting on the b-70 to make a quick pot of your favorite tea, and that can be gourmet tea if you want which is nice. I have had two units. Both broke after about 11 months to a year. So don't expect them to last for a long time. Still I will probably buy a third. Im a 5-7 cup a day person and sometimes you need a quick fresh cup of average coffee."
negative,"Terribly, terribly disappointing: Brokaw has managed to take wonderful raw material and produce a book that would not challenge a junior high school student. The book is shallow and banal. I am sorry I wasted my money on it and even sorrier that he will receive it. Surely a man who makes his living with words can do better than this."
positive,"The Hobbit's True Review: Bilbo was a quiet, calm Hobbit who loved to eat and live in comfort. That's just what he did until a band of dwarves led by a wizard came with an interesting proposition-stay home safe and happy or help kill a dragon and face certain death? What will Bilbo do? Will he accept? Of all the mysterious and adverturous things in this book there is one drawback. There are so many characters that it gets confusing. But do read the book. To help, write down the characters and a few personality traits to help understand them more. This book is enjoyable for all ages, but is suggested for teens and adults. The plot is amazing and keeps the readers eyes glued to the pages. The story pulls you into it as if you were helping Bilbo and marching off to fight the dragon. The details are magnificent and the adventure is enough to make your heart throb. The Hobbit is a book to read when you have lots of time and feel the need to read!"
negative,"voowho? what-man?: bad thing--this movie would have been better if it showed here (as on utube) the monsters' face & more of its whole self-was ""up"" w/ that?--here we sure know whats ""down""--ridiculous waste of monsta. movie would have been better using the monster more."
negative,"Don't buy the full screen version: Be carefully which version buy. Unlike other studios that offers both full and widescreen on the same DVD, Universal is dumb and greedy enough to release two versions. Check the right version before you buy. The full frame version must from the VHS tape master which is less detail and grainy compares to the widescreen version not to mention mutilated the film.The sound is the same for both films, which are good but not great. Wish they had DTS version instead of the full frame.Four stars for the widescreen version on audio and video.Three stars for the content as a decent B movie."
positive,"Pierce Brosnan & John LeCarre have a sense of humor: Brosnan's turn as a ""bizarro"" James Bond is perfect. Geoffrey Rush's best performance since Shine but Jamie Lee Curtis seems out of place as his wife."
negative,"Cheap crystal set.: As a previous reviewer stated, the creamer and sugar dish are of a ridiculously small size and are not the same as shown in the picture. One of the salt and pepper shakers was lopsided. The set is made in China and is worth $20 at best. I would be embarrassed to give this as a gift."
positive,"Fierce: Have been looking for a book that gives the definitions, basics and more importantly the ratings of the various financial instruments available. This is it. I did not give it a full five stars because there were certain definitions that were obscure and some of the stories, while enjoyable, were overly longwinded. But a great all round book nevertheless."
positive,"Definitely memorable...will read again: Like most of Stephen King's work, DreamCatcher is a very original story that is hard to forget once you have finished. There are certain parts of the story that jump out and grab you. Stephen King has said in many ways,Dreamcatcher is a mean book. He's right...DreamCatcher goes for the jugular and doesnt hold back. Hands down, Dreamcatcher is flat out GROSS. This was one of those stories that made me feel sick and uncomfortable. Translation, Stephen King Delivers the Goods! Great bleak story from King Writimus Maximus. Enjoy!"
positive,Love: I love these old TV shows. This was a good buy for the amount of shows you get. It came quickly too!
positive,"A great buy!: I love this air mattress! Very easy to set up and put away and very comfy to sleep on. I have slept on other air mattresses before and this is by far the best one I have ever slept on. The soft top makes it so you don't feel like you're sticking to it, but I put a blanket over it anyway for extra comfort. I have been recommending this one to all of my friends, I'm very happy with it!"
positive,"Fascinating review of new research: The best way to sample this book would be to read the original essay: [...] I saw that at the time, and found it pretty fascinating already. The book expands massively on the essay, as it should, but the basic thesis is there.1491 falls into the genre of authors telling us what we know is wrong, which is interesting but makes a skeptical reader ask if the claims are overblown or even true. (Cf. Gavin Menzies's _1421_, which does not seem to hold up.) Charles Mann provides so many references that his books turn out to be rather shorter than they first appear, but it's comforting that his claims are also consistent with various news articles and other facts. E.g. [...]And claims that Indians managed North America with fire are made more plausible by my having read Stephen Pyne's books on the use of fire in land management, including by the Australian aborigines."
negative,"Too disturbing for most readers: Written in a claustrophobic, stream-of-consciousness style, this is a portrait of a young woman deeply damaged by emotional and physical incest. The broken chronology and distorted perceptions make the reader feel as confused as the protagonist herself. I had to force myself to finish reading the book. It might have been worthwhile if there were some character development and resolution of the protagonist's psychological problems. Instead I was disappointed by an apparent happy ending that seemed forced and unbelievable. Marble Skin may be well-written (apart from the contrived ending), but it's certainly not enjoyable reading."
negative,a huge disappointment to this fan: I have waited anxiously for any new work from this usually-hilarious author and made the mistake of buying his newest book as soon as it came out. It seems Mr. Sedaris may be going through a midlife crisis as the majority of the stories were very introspective and not at all funny. I was left with a feeling of sadness instead of the usual uplifting I recieve from the view of his unusual family and love lives. I would NOT recommend this to anyone looking for an amusement.
positive,"""Carpet didn't match the curtains"": I was disappointed the product received didn't match the photo here; there was no flange on the top as indicated in the photo. The other drawback was the fact the holder was 'closed' at the bottom; I intended to use this as a net holder and wanted the handle to pass all the way through.Those things said...the vendor was very responsive to my request for return and full credit. Then, having had the weekend to consider, I was able to cut out the bottom of the liner sleeve, thus allowing the net handle to pass through as desired!I haven't had the boat on the water yet, but expect this unit to perform just fine."
negative,"Great Expectations, a great disapointment: Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wopsle's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read ""A Christmas Carol"" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."
negative,"Questionable quality: The teas are good, don't get me wrong, but the whole reason I purchased this for my wife was because of the box. And the quality of the box is mediocre at best. The corners were worn and the gold trim paint was splattered all over the top of the thing. Yikes!"
negative,"DUDE PLEASE: First off I want to say I can enjoy crude, mindless comedy as well as the next person but this movie is just too plain dumb, whether intentionally or not to enjoy. I chuckled a few times but was really very annoyed by the repetition in a lot of the scenes (""And Then"", Dude what's my tatto say?) Ironically I rented this because my 14 year old daughter wanted to see it and she didn't last through the movie because even she said it was too stupid. This movies target audience is 8 to 14 year old boys who probably get a big kick out of such stupidity. Unless you are in that category, skip this."
positive,"Happy: The Saris bike rack worked out great. I had borrowed a three bike Saris rack from a friend and decided to get one for myself. I only needed a rack to carry two bikes so thats what I ordered. When it arrived I was taken aback by the fact it wasn't quite like my friends although it looked exactly like it in the online picture. It only had one upper arm rather then two like my friends. Over wise it was identical. I almost sent it back but decided to try it out instead. Glad I did because my concerns about stability with just one upper arm was quickly dispelled. Great rack, rock solid."
positive,"yum: It's very difficult to find these in stores and the prices have been good in Amazon. I love cotton candy and these give me that and each lasts longer than a bag of actual CC! I have a big sweet tooth and I use these as a treat when I'm craving something much higher calorie!If you like cotton candy, they are a must-try!"
positive,21st century reading: It was interesting to read this book again in 2006. It is fascinating to read this book and then analysis and compare the different governments in today's world.
negative,"way too long: I agree with whoever wrote that this book was way too long and unorganized. I was hoping to learn more about the behind the scenes works, and boy, did I. Drugs, partying, sexism, racism, it's all here and more. There are some great gems among all the trivia people already know.But it's all quotes from the different actors, writers and producers. There are some photos to break things up, but nothing else. No cute little sidebars or anything. Heck, if it's good enough for my school textbooks, why not put some in here. I don't have ADD, but it got tedious after awhile.The format makes for an odd read. You get things like someone rapsodizing about what a ""beautiful person"" John Belushi was a couple paragraphs after someone reminiscing about the time he set stuff on fire and passed out in a drunken stupor. Oh well."
negative,"TERRIBLE, LONG-BORING, COULDN'T WAIT TO PUT IT DOWN....: I am a fan of Tom Clancy. I have read all but 2 of his novels and this was by far the worse....the story line was good, but the detail was so boring i wanted to skip half the book. In 350 pages this could have been good....now i understand why some readers view clancy as too detailed, technical and boring...."
positive,"buy this cd!: the new pearl jam is well worth it. anyone who says these guys are over are crazy. track five alone is worth the money. my favorite by far is ""sleight of hand"" with the odd 5/4 time signature in the verse. that had to be new drummer Matt Cameron of Soundgarden's idea. if the last album ""Yield"" let you down, dont worry, binaural wont. (i liked yield). buy this cd!"
negative,"Good vac but..: I liked the vacuum cleaner when it arrived. I loved the retracting cord and I wonder why everyone doesn't do it. It seems light weight and easy to use. I also like the way the cannister is designed.The belt that runs the floor brush broke 35 days into it. Now I can't return it to Amazon and Hoover doesn't cover the belt under warranty.I now tend to agree with the other reviews that say that it is poorly built and the customer service is poor as well.update: I bought a $5 belt and put it in and it seems to be working fine now. It makes more noise than when I bought it, but works. i give it a **** now."
positive,"Air supply: No body does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest. Baby your the best air flow, added H.P. and performance for the money period."
negative,"""I was frozen today!"": ""Suburban Commando"" is one of wrestler Hulk Hogan's many forays into ""family-friendly"" movies. In this one, he stars as Shep,an intergalactic hero on the run from evil bounty hunters and a preening,flamboyant bad guy. He crash lands on Earth, meeting an uptight businessman (Christopher Lloyd) and his wife (Shelley Duvall). He gives helpful inspirational moral lessons throughout the film, not unlike the '80s kiddie shows of the time ""He-Man"" and ""She-Ra."" The difference being,those shows were only a half hour,and actually enjoyable. In one cringe-worthy scene, Lloyd and Duvall are on the verge of making love. Yes,one day the kids will ask where babies will come from, but this scene will make them celibate. The final fight is horribly cheesy. ""Suburban Commando"" does embody the crass materialism of the suburbs.... no, it's just a bad movie."
positive,Interesting History of the Durango area fire: I bought this book because we visited this area of Colorado every year but I did not know the complete history of the forest fire and the subsequent mudslides that followed. Lots of pics and history.
positive,"I didn't fall asleep. That's a good sign!: Okay, I had to read this book for school. From the description on the back I didn't think that it would be very interesting. I was wrong. It held my attention with it's colorful words and characters and kept me guessing about some characters. Anyway, overall it was a very good book. I only wish that the ending was developed more and wasn't one of those ""use your imagination"" endings."
positive,"Quite Unnerving: I have just finished reading all of the Tom Clancy books, and I have to say this is my favorite. During the course of this mainly Jack Ryian odessy, I cam back and read this book 3 times. The first time I found it exciting, but I was rather confused by some of the technical details. The second time through I concentrated on figuring out what was going on in the parts that I didn't understand, and once I did, I reread the book. This time through I found myself identifying with many of the characters. Morris seemed to remind me of my uncles, and I thought that these people seemed totally realistic. I would recommend that anyone who has the time (it took me 2 months, 3 weeks, and 4 days to read it twice) to read such a book."
positive,"Wow: This book was a huge, sad eye opener. I happen to be from the same small town where the author grew up, and my parents knew her parents (in fact our fathers were both physicians and were in the same professional circles). Although I don't know the family personally, I know from my parents that these secrets were kept completely under wraps - they fronted themselves as a very strong family unit and major do-gooders. My heart goes out to Julia, and hope that writing this exceptional book has allowed her to have some healing. What a strong woman, with such a strong talent for the written word. Excellent."
negative,Jewsof China:Historical perspective vol1.: The book detailed only a few famililys ans failed to provide the scope of activity among the broader jewish families at largre. An index of sur- nnames would have bee usseful.
positive,"If you are a history buff, you will LOVE this movie....: Peck is excellent. The quotes from this movie coupled with the Ed Flanders's portray of Harry Truman, coupled with the accuracy of the film historically make this probably my all time favorite film. and the darn thing is on back order! Fudge."
negative,"This book is terrible!: If there was a rating for zero stars, this book deserves it. I've never read anything so awful. If I didn't have to read it for school, I wouldn't have gotten past the 1st chapter. Hard to understand, slow moving, and plain old boring are just a beginning of all the things I hated about this book. As for everyone else in my class, they all hate it too. I'm about to form a petition against it."
positive,"The Perfect Cigar Journal...almost: Read the past reviews says it all. This is a great find. I've been keeping a journal for a few years and now a very classy hardbound book shows the passion people can express about the cigars they smoke. I bought this black leather bound book with gold embossed lettering ""Cigar Dossier"". Although I do have one problem: I have done about 50 pages with my cigar bands glued in its appropriate box and now this book is becoming much thicker than the binder. This will cheapen the look more and more as time goes on. Nonetheless, this is the best I've seen and definitely worth the buy."
positive,"In good condition: I ordered this movie used, but it didn't matter. It was in good condition and far less expensive than buying it new. A good movie, but I liked the 2nd one better. We'll see what the 3rd one has to offer..."
negative,"Unbelievably stupid.: Please don't believe the dorks who ask you to ""please ignore those who rated this movie badly"". Because really, it is EXTREMELY bad. Between the sad, predictable, badly-acted lines and dorky plotline, there isn't much to admire. Nothing in this movie made me think Spiderman was real (come on, it's freaking 2004, hire a company that knows CGI for petes sakes), nor any of the lame romance lines or any of the ""enemy's"" lines. I'm sure a good kid with superpowers would turn his back on someone getting pummeled. Yeah. I'm sure some redheaded [...] marrying someone else would still love a dork who acts like a hero but really ain't. Right. And please don't ask me to mention how many scenes were either rancidly lame, incredibly boring, or repeated without reason. I won't even go there.This movie sucks. I cannot WAIT for Superman [...]. Trust me, some people know how to make movies. Others do not.Pass this one up."
positive,Exactly What I Wanted: This is the same bible my church uses as pew bibles. Appears well bound at a reasonable price for a large print ESV bible.
negative,"She can't sing!: This album received a fair amount of critical acclaim, so I thought I'd give it a listen. Well so much for critics! Gainsbourg can't sing a lick. She makes people like Britney Spears, Jessical Simpson & Janet Jackson sound like Beverly Sills or Marilyn Horne. The producers must recognize this too, because her voice is mixed very low on most of the tracks. On top of not being able to sing, she doesn't compose and doesn't play an instrument. So why is there a CD bearing her name? You got me. Maybe cashing in on daddy's renown? The botton line is don't waste your money. If you want to hear some good French CDs, check out ""Hors de Toute Doute"" or ""Le Silence des Roses"" by France D'Amour (from Quebec)."
negative,"Can't give a minus star review!: It's pathetic that perhaps the greatest sea battle in U.S. history generated such a lousy movie.This movie stinks on many levels. It uses outtakes from Tora Tora Tora, so the viewer sees interesting things like battleship masts at Midway. The actors, except maybe Henry Fonda and Hal Holbrook, do lousy jobs. Charlton Heston is particularly irritating- you get the impression that he was running the Pacific fleet and Admiral Nimitz just came in on the weekends to read his mail.The ""romance"" angle in the movie just slows it down and somehow makes you wonder if these people's personal problems were bigger than World War II!"
positive,"Good Script, Good acting, Still falls short: I liked this movie, Vincent D'Onofrio is amazing. The first half hour is slow but it really picks up after. The dialogue is good and keeps it snappy. A good rental or buy when the price comes down."
positive,It was a beautiful tale of Bilbo's journey: It was amazingly captivating and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole adventure. An inspiring story that everyone should read.
positive,Best product ever!!: This is by far the best lubricant I have ever tried and great for those with sensitive skin. It has no smell and no taste which is a huge plus in my book! It feels like silk on your skin and never gets sticky feeling. I will never use anything else after trying this!
negative,Wished I could have tried it.: Not all parts were there for me to know if I liked it or not so a one star is all I can give.
negative,"has some value: if you're the kind of lowlife that gets off on an extensive (half-hour or so) scene of the screaming torture of a woman (the majority of the movie, after the first 4 friends are knocked off in rapid-fire succession), then by all means get this movie--at least it will keep you off the streets for that long. stupid, crass, tasteless, degenerate trash. not that I was shocked or outraged--this was just clearly something that I never needed to see, and really that never needed to be made. and I'm not at all a prig. pure trash. (despite some clever lines and whatnot in other parts.)"
positive,"Got the remastered blu-ray - one of the best: Most people have seen this movie so I am not going to go into the plot.I ordered this blu on 12/ 28 / 10 and recieved the remastered blu -ray edition the next day.Picture quality is fantastic and there are no negatives that I noticed that should keep anyone from buying this blu-ray for the first time, or anyone who wants to upgrade from their DVD.This movie is about honor and loyalty. Two qualities I believe are most important in life. Violent, moving, and a great story. One of my top 3 favorite movies of all time."
negative,"Beautiful scenery, but thats about all: Very little plot, VERY predictable, just a movie to show off a pretty face.The only saving part of the movie were the carpenters that helped Ms. Lane restore the old Tuscan villa that she had purchased. They were also a bit predictable, but rather endearing."
negative,slow: interesting and well worth a read but difficult with the old English at times and tends to be long winded and rambles somewhat
negative,"poorly done: This book was not helpful as a reference in the ASQ SSBB exam. (Go to the Indiana Society of Quality materials for a good reference.) It does not have the level of detail in subject areas to be a functional reference, and according to their own CD full of corrections and further reviews below, it is not helpful as a technical reference."
negative,"Can I give it a lower rating, please?: I bought this book about 3 years ago, I believe.I almost always buy books before I read them, mostly due to the fact that I do all of my book buying online...... But just this once, I wish there were a library for these sorts of books that I could've read through it before buying... It would've been nice if I had someone at the time to advice me against spending that $20...I am against any religious bashing, which Ravenwolf does a couple of times towards Christianity. Bashing is a pretty strong word, but still -- what right do any of us have to call another religion's believes ""superstitions""?I wish so badly that this book, when it came to the spells and rituals, would be more of a guide instead of a step by step instruction manual.I also wish that there was SOMETHING about the Rede in there, something more about meditation, and karma...To make a long story short:I recycled it.And that says a lot.Find another book -- please."
negative,"wrong blanket: It looks fine, but... When I saw the composition, I couldn't believe it.I received 55%wool & 45% synthetic, instead 70%wool.Maybe wrong shipment???"
positive,"Camp-Fest ala Mae: I'm amazed this many other people have seen this movie! I loved it! Mae in glorious technicolor reviving Diamond Lil is fantastic! The entire movie is hilarious, probably not in the way that Mae intended, but I'm sure she's happy to get a laugh. And the fact she did this at 85 is astounding. This is also the only movie you see her drink alcohol in."
negative,"too high carb for real weight loss: Each soup alone has over 20g of carbs! And that's just for soup not a meal! To lose weight (not just maintain your current weight) you can only eat 20-30grams of carbs per day, not per meal.Most of these veggie cookbooks are for the rich anyway, a lot of the ingredients are only available at fancy-pants stores like whole foods. I hate to say it but diets like Atkins are within reach for low-income folks. Who has time (or money) to find something called 'mirin' whatever that is"
negative,"Poor quality reproduction of a favorite: Anne Perry has been one of my favorite authors for many, many years. I was delighted to see that the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series is available on Kindle. However, as I am re-reading the old favorites, I am very disappointed by the poor reproduction quality of the entire series. Many words are misspelled through obvious optical character recognition errors. The price of each book warrants at least a proofread of the content. My rating is based on this issue; a review of the writing and storyline would be much, much higher."
negative,"Effective and easy to read but the facts need work: If conservatives rely on the facts and liberals on emotion, one would expect this to be a supremely liberal book. Characterizing Clinton as weak on the military or liberalism is one good example. The simple fact is that the US brushed away Iraq with a military force that had been trained and armed by the Clinton administration; yet Clinton was characterized as weak and anti-military. The Bush administration's failure to follow up on warnings issued by the Clinton administration about Al Qaeda and its plans to use aircraft in terrorist acts against the US are ignored. And so on. We could all benefit from a considered debate on this issues with the basic assumption that we are all in this together. Unfortunately this book is not a contributer to that cause."
negative,"Management tips on a 3rd grade reading level: Hands down, this is one of the most ludicrious books I have ever picked up.I was a little miffed when I opened the box and realized what I'd paid $11.95 (plus postage) for, but that was nothing. The print is large. Some of the pages are only half full. Was this an attempt to draw out what should have been a booklet? Or maybe not printed at all? The behavioral modifications presented can be picked up easily. Positive reinforcement gets better results than punishment-how new is that idea? Or how about ""clearly communicate goals""? Good grief. If this is truly the state of management today I think I'll take my master's in psychology, write a repetitive, inane book and make a fortune. If your IQ is above 75, skip this."
positive,"Simply a Classic: My personal favorite of Ray Bradbury, and the first of his I ever read. This book is one of his most classic and timeless contributions to science fiction. I must buy for anyone."
negative,"Not deserving of two stars: I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. I bought this DVD from Wal-Mart's bargain bin and I feel cheated out of $5. I tried to watch it twice, the second time skipping through the especially stupid and unfunny parts, and still could not bring myself to finish it. I've seen just about every parody movie Hollywood has come out with and this one is at the bottom. To quote a great comedy, Date Movie is ""dreadful, embarrassing, terrible, horrifyingly bad, bad, bad..."""
positive,"One of the best spy thrillers I've ever read: This is far superior to most spy fiction, in which the heroes rely primarily on their combat skills and on their brains secondarily; they usually have supporting characters to help them do hard intellectual tasks like read.Fortunately, TASS IS AUTHORIZED TO ANNOUNCE is a complete break from that. There's only a little action right near the end, the focus is definitely on what is, essentially, a giant game of chess between the CIA and the KGB, with agents trying to outwit and outthink one another.Although there could be a little confusion at times (the translations from Russian weren't always clear, and two similar characters share the same name), I certainly didn't see any evidence of anti-Semitism as was claimed. For the most part I am highly satisfied with this Soviet spy novel."
negative,"I Know, I Know...: I'm probably going to have one of those 0 out of 345 people found this review helpful, but something went wrong. I LOVE ten as well as I love Vs. and Yield, but this is not a strong effort. I gave it two stars because I believe there are two VERY GOOD songs on it ""Nothihg as it seems"" and the best song ""Sleight of Hand"". I see many people reviewing it saying it was so great, but really, if this wasnt PJ they would rank it very low. I could care less about the whole ""grunge is dead"" and ""go back music like ten"", the lyrics would have been good if it were spoken word but w/the music behind it, it doesnt sound right, not to mention the lack of overall rocking that makes PJ a great band. I LOVED Tiny Music.. by STP(witch was not rocking either) and some people hated it, maybe its a aquired taste, but its not for me"
positive,"Hobbit: Hobbit - good read, moved right along. Good descriptions. Good foundation for the rest of the series and or books.Hobbit"
positive,"A Great Beginning: I loved this movie so much. Everything was perfect. It balanced the action and the drama perfectly and was a very mature film. It was realistic and not cartooney like the next four films in the series. The acting all round was excellent. Christian Bale was great as Batman. Also Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman and everyone were great. But I was most surprised with Katie Holmes. She really held her own standing among these great male actors. Overall BATMAN BEGINS is the best of the five Batman films.The Series:1- BATMAN BEGINS2- BATMAN3- BATMAN RETURNS4- BATMAN FOREVER5- BATMAN & ROBIN"
positive,Awesome: Awesome I love this book so much Dickens is truly a genius. Have read this many times before and this was the best one!
positive,"Easy Read: Probably the easiest read of all John Steinbeck's books. I knocked this one out in one day after fighting my way through The Grapes of Wrath in my last read. I'm working my way through the author's California books and I'm about to start East of Eden. Only one more California book after that - Sweet Thursday. Cannery Row is so easy to follow, especially if you have seen the Nick Nolte movie which is a combination of Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday."
negative,"What a waste of money!: This movie was an insult to my intellegence. Helen Hunt must have needed work bad to portray such a dim-wit. Everything funny in the movie had been shown in the trailers. Mel Gibson as a non macho man would have been worthwhile, had he pulled it off. His attempts at being sincere reminded me of Bill Murray in Ground Hog Day before he got it right."
positive,"Read this book!!: I wanted Treekeepers to go on forever--I couldn't put it down. The story is told in a vivid way that makes it more like watching a movie than reading a book. The main character is an orphan girl named Bird who thinks of herself as tough and brave, which she is. But she also has a tender heart. As she battles her way through life, looking for her father and a way to heal her land, her heart slowly grows in tenderness. She finds people she can love--and who love her. But also, she fails miserably in her quest, until in the end, well, you have to read the book. There is something comforting about the way this story is told. It's like being wrapped up in a warm blanket in front of a fire on a cold night. I will soon be 40, but I still crave such stories."
positive,"Eerily amazing: When I first saw this book in my photo class, I thought the images were amazing and frightening at the same time, but I didn't read the text with all the pictures. When I bought it for myself, and got to read everything, it gave me even more of a respect for this work. Her snips of these girls lives rattle and amaze you at the same time. I love this book so much, and I think every girl/woman should look at it."
positive,"A Powerful Romance To Stir Your Soul: The Call of the Canyon is another of Zane Grey's ""war novels"" which is to say, it deals with the subject of the mistreatment of returning veterans from the first world war. But it is also the coming of age of a modern ""sophisticated"" woman who learns the real meaning of love, and what it means to love someone. The story has several scenes which take place in New York City as well as at Oak Creek Canyon in Arizona. For pure romance, this book can not be beat. Carly Birch is one of Zane Grey's finest female characters, and again I will say he often wrote from the woman's point of view which is why the vast majority of his work was published in the leading ""women's"" magazines of the day, and his readership was more than half women. So, ladies, please don't dismiss Zane Grey as a ""western"" writer; he was so much more than that."
positive,"Imaginative, Suspenseful Sci-Fi Action Flick: Caveat: I am not an Asimov or sci-fi purist. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, especially the special effects. It's a very imaginative and suspenseful story. Lots of action. Surround sound/DTS is great. Sonny the robot rules -- and steals the show. Beltrami's soundtrack is excellent. VERY strong 4 stars for this."
negative,"Dumb adaptation that does not try to be even remotely good: Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects.For Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the film gets a four rating. The rest of the film does not even merit one."
negative,"Watch out for product switching: I ordered the Hunt(R) Boston(R) 1800 Series Electric Pencil Sharpener, from Amazon.com and they in turn sent the order to Office Depot which sells those X-Acto By Boston 1800 Series Electric Sharpener, Black Sharpeners made in China that will not sharpen a pencil to save your life, the same ones they sell at Staples, which is why I tried to buy the Hunt(R) Boston(R) 1800 Series Electric Sharpener online. Now I have to send it back and try to get the good Boston pencil sharpener with the strong electric motor in it that will sharpen a pencil, stuff made in china is crap, boycott all products made in china."
negative,"Uninspired: Gee, I wasn't as impressed as you guys. I found it quite tedious. Bram Stoker's original is one of a kind. This is not even remotely in the same league. Sorry."
negative,"Barry Manilow meets Neal Diamond: This is a huge diappointment. The producers of this CD should be publicly flogged. Clay's fans love his strong, booming voice and ability to pound out ballads. You'll hear NONE of that on this CD. I am amazed that producers with decades of experience wouldn't understand that fans want to hear the full range of Clay's voice. Instead, what you will hear are a bunch of sappy, run of the mill pop tunes that will uninspire. Save your money and buy some old Barry Manilow cd's. At least you'll get what you are paying for. Let's hope, on his next CD, that Clay is allowed to sing the way we all know that he can."
positive,"Great: Great movie. Full of action, corpses, skeletal demons, and of ther things. The best part is with the scantily-clad hottie at the beginning. Oh Man she was a hottie!! OHHH!!!Other good movies are Dragonheart and Tremors."
negative,"Needs a better string quartet: As a musician and musicology student, I am very familar with both the ""classical"" world of music, and the popular world of music, and I have to say that perhaps string quartet versions of R.E.M. might be interesting, but you need a creative and enterprising quartet (such as Kronos Quartet, etc.) to do this. This CD is greatly disappointing because the transcriptions are simplistic and lacking imagination. String quartet recordings can be very exciting, but not here!"
negative,"Missing content: This review applies only to the 2002 Modern Library Classics edition of the book. I read the book partly online but mostly as this paperback. At the very end there is, in this paperback edition, a very important section missing. It's in chapter 113. Right after Dantes takes his leave of Mercedes, and before he meets Morrel in the cemetery, the online version includes what must be several pages where Dantes returns to the Chateau d'If. Inexplicably, the whole episode is missing in this paperback edition."
positive,"We love love love this toy!: We have a five month old daughter and she goes to sleep with the ocean wonders aquarium almost every night. In the middle of the night she stirs alot and flings her arms out to the side. She turns on the aquarium and out she goes. We like the bubble, swimming, music setting. I would recommend this to anyone!"
negative,"Dreamcatcher put me to sleep: I am a Stephen King-a-holic. I buy everything as soon as it comes out... Even though there are few characters, I had trouble keeping up with them. Duddits speech patterns were annoying because I could never figure them out unless King translated. This is the only King book that I skipped over boring parts and had trouble reading to the end. I usually finish a good King book in a day or two but this took me a week because it wasn't good. I miss vintage King (The Stand, Salems Lot) those were good books. This one unfortunately, is not."
negative,"Too bad Amazon can't help out students: I am admitting this review does not relate to the actual book but to Amazon so with apologies to Ray Bradbury...Ten bucks? Really? Come on Amazon, you know this book is on a lot of school reading lists. My kid loves her Kindle but when I can buy her school reading book lists for $2 at the used book store, you lost. In fact, it is a weird circle of irony - we used to buy books, they got too expensive, bought the kindle, it was great, then you made the books expensive again and... now we buy the books. You lost an opportunity here, Amazon. For the record, she hasnt picked up her Kindle in a month.Too bad for you."
negative,"This was worse for Dennis than Meg Ryan....: I saw this movie when on vacation in Utah. I could not believe a talent like Dennis Quaid was wasted in a go-nowhere movie like this.I have seen Dennis Quaid in several films, and I have to say the only thing watchable about this film is his performance in it. His co-star is wooden, and unbelievable. The plot was not written well enough to hold my interest, even as an action movie.Go rent this before you spend the money on it."
positive,Gift: My husband started reading the series but did not have the complete set. I purchased several books to complete the set for him. He has really enjoyed reading them and has shared them with family members.
negative,"Not for everyone: As a fan of jazz from the 50's and 60's, I keep trying to like this piece. Many of Coltrane's phrases repeat the same notes over and over. This can be clever once in a while, but over and over, it's just annoying. The first number is torture if you like melodic music. There's no connection between the phasing and the rhythm. Again, is this supposed to be clever? If you subscribe to the idea that ""weird is genious"", then you may like this CD.There are many sax players from this period who have better tone and phrasing. Coltrane's tone is like listening to someone sing while holding their nose."
negative,Simple & Simply Delicious by Sylvie Rocher: I bought this book based on the reviews that I had read that seemed to indicate the book was of a superior standard. I have to say that I am very disappointed in the book. The layout and pictures are extremely amateurish and the recipes look like something a child would put together not an experienced book. I would not recommend the book to anyone who is a good and experienced cook. It is extremely over priced for the lack of content. Definitely not recommended.
negative,"great when it works: Love the product, B70, when it works. Love the choice of coffees and the design. The problem is the unit keeps cutting off for no reason, meaning each time we'd like coffee, we have to wait for the unit to essentially reboot. Also, the amount of coffee portioned out seems to vary even when using the same setting. Took it back and heard many others are having the same problem with the unit shutting off. Too bad. I'm going to give the second unit a chance because we like the concept...but the unit must be reliable. We'll look for other options if this one also fails. Keurig is missing a grand brand-building opportunity, given they own the market. Quality control seems to be an issue.Keurig B70 Gourmet Single-Cup Home Brewing System"
negative,"WTF is this?!: Real words, unlike what you'd find in this book, cannot describe what you find in here. This book is the bane of my existence. James Joyce must have self-inflicted mercury poisoning in order to write this. The only other plausible explanation is that he became severely mentally retarded from a lack of flow of oxygen to the brain. If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY ""sentence"". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of. If the author came back to life, became unretarded, and then read his own book again, he would instantly want to drown himself in Lake Michigan. I award him no stars and may God have mercy on his soul."
positive,Gillette Fusion Blades: Great Price and arrived very quickly. I will never pay full price for blades again.
positive,"Loved it!: Paolini's first novel is a thoughtful, action-packed fantasy tale chock full of magic, exciting landscapes and mythical creatures. What makes this book so enjoyable though, is that Paolini has given all his characters unexpected depth and complexity. There are no cardboard cut-out, stereotypes here! Yes, there are some similarities to other fantasy novels, but who cares!! I can't wait to see what happens in the next installment..."
negative,Far Cry From Original: Don't waste your time or money on this remake. Even Rebecca's hotness can't save it. Watch the original with James Caan.
positive,"Great Deal for an average condom.: These are thin enough to make you forget that you are wearing a condom, but they are a little tight. I am very happy with this purchase. Definitely worth the low low price."
positive,"Excellent Starter Pack!: This pack includes several chess programs and a six month membership in the Internet Chess Club. The ICC membership alone is worth the price of the software. The pack includes Chessmaster 4000, an earlier version of the noted chess software series, a solid program for beginning and intermediate players. Also it has Maurice Ashley Teaches Chess, an outstanding program for children by America's newest Grandmaster. His narration makes chess fun and exciting using solid graphics and lessons to get your child started the right way. These programs, plus Combat Chess and Grandmaster Chess Ultra make this package an tremendous value!"
negative,"Noah is probably turning over in his grave!: Supposedly witty and humorous, as a devoutly religious person, I found the book to be way too irreverent for my comfort level; it seemed to mock God (as well as Noah), and I couldn't force myself to read the last half (although I skimmed a few sections). Noah was not pictured as a Godly being but as somewhat of a tyrant, and I didn't feel that the sexual ""escapades"" belonged in a Bible story.I'm sure there are those who are in disagreement, but this is, honestly, how I felt about the book and cannot recommend it."
negative,"Language problem on cassette: I loved this movie as a child and thought my six year old and I would listen to the book on cassette. I was not prepared, nor did I remember, the use of language in the movie. The third time I heard the Lord's name taken in vain, I turned the cassette off. I am going to buy the book and read it to my son, skipping those parts. I guess when I watched the movie (many moons ago) that language was not allowed on television and therefore we were not subjected to it. I was very disappointed in the book on tape. The story is wonderful. The authors (two of the children) could have alluded to the language without repeating it. I rate it two stars because of this."
positive,Great Book!: I just love this book. I had this book on paperback. Of course someone lent it and never returned. I was so happy to find it as an ebook.
positive,"In a cave, but not The Cave: At first look, this movie would seem like a rip off of The Cave, and does have a similar concept, but much better done. It's not often that a movie grabs your attention within the first 5 minutes, but this one does and keeps it until the end. Lots of things popping out should keep you guessing. It's a nice addition to the horror genre and dances circles around it's U.S. counterpart."
negative,"Guys talking over a beat, great!: This is a joke right?! I honestly thought this group was a hiphop parody group at first because I figured nobody could be that bad on purpose. These British rappers are hiliarous, they basically talk over a beat and it doesn't even rhyme half the time. I got given this cd for free and I still want some money back!"
positive,"The biggest I have....CD VERSION: I'm an avid collector of Webster dictionaries and this one is definetely the biggest one available, but it has serious drawbacks too.Firstly, the layout is very bad.When I click it, it seems to me that everything is a bit messy.It lacks geographical names, colloquial terms and the usage notes are rare and not very clear as well. This dictionary includes many dialectical words like""mud clerk"" that are not included in other unabridged dictionaries.This book is helpful with pronunciation (there are usually several variants included)and etymology (for those who need it)Still, I would highly recommand Random House Webster's Unabridged instead, for those who need detailed and absolutely perfect usage notes and regional varations. Random House has only 320 000 words, but includes geographical names and proper nouns.4 stars overall for being the biggest and for some helpful option available on this CD"
positive,"California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy: The California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy,is to spice up the relationship and it worked since the beginning,my other half likes it."
negative,"Extremely Disappointed: I ordered this product to do some tests on huma- I mean NON-human subjects, and wouldn't you know, the container broke open mid-shipping. I opened the box it was shipped in and the Uranium flooded my arms and entered my blood stream. I have already grown six new arms, as well as four new legs. You read right, I have fourteen limbs.What was left in the container I used in my experiment, and it FAILED! Now I have to find a burial site.DO NOT BUY!"
positive,"I love this movie: The new Batman movies are awesome. I love Batman, I hope they come out with a third movie soon."
positive,"Not for the jaded or hardcore fantasy fan: After browsing the other comments on this book, I'd like to point out three things. Firstly, do not read this book if you're a jaded individual with an inability or unwillingness to appreciate an innocent and charming tale. Secondly, stay away from it if you're a hardcore fantasy reader who began with more modern writers. You'll likely be disapointed (conversely, if you don't generally care for fantasy, you may just love this book, as I did). Finally, don't even attempt to read it if you consider the TV Guide listings to be a challenging read with a complex plot and too many characters. On a final note, I first read this book as an adult and did not find it to be ""too childish"" as some suggest and yes, I've read a few other books, thank you."
negative,Dosen't play well: This DVD does not play well at all. I wish I would have purchased this elsewhere. The price for this should have been much less to equal the quality.
positive,"human character in constant conflict between strong forces: Good literature provides keen observations in behaviors and psychology of human beings when faced with moral choices and consequences, and this book definitely is filled with good stuff. The main character, Mr. Henchard, is severely flawed and his iniquities are multiple, and yet, he also is so human and really hard not to have sympathetic feelings toward him in the end. The writing is wonderfully philosophical and dramatic, especially the last paragraph of Elizabeth-Jane's reflection on life is movingly insightful."
positive,"Very Good Performance: I got this as a spare battery for my Panasonic Lumix TZ3 digicam. But it works really well to be called as a ""Spare"". The performance is fantastic, and it lasts me for over 150 shots. Does not perform as good as the original battery supplied by Panasonic, but for the price difference I would recommend it any day. Can be definitely had as a backup battery."
negative,not happy: This ball has to be re-infalted every other day. I do use it every day and the air loss is such that it HAS to be re-inflated.
positive,"A deep book: The Heart is a lonely Hunter is a very different sort of book. I've read quite a few books, and never one quite like it. One person I know compared it to the Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath because of the dark story line. The story is based upon the lives of 5 main characters, the majority of the story telling spent on the mute John Singer and the teenager Mick Kelly. Themes of alienation, isolation, intolerance, loneliness, and the fulfillment of dreams dominate the novel. The opposite of a superficial book, this story is about how people feel at their core and their dreams and aspirations. The writing is good, but just not very happy. The focus is more on how lonely each character feels and for what reasons. After reading it, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter forced me to think deeply. And I believe the title sums up what Carson McCullers was trying to say in her first novel."
negative,"Very Small and only 8 pictures: This coloring book is a quarter of the size of a regular coloring book. It only measures 4"" by 5"". No where in the description does it say this book is so small!!! I was expecting a normal 12""x8"" They need to put this in the information. Plus there is only 8 pages!"
negative,"838,000 CAN BE WRONG, I'M LIVING PROOF: I have listened to it several times. Each time I read the reviews here people keep saying you need to listen to it over and over to like it. Well, I've listened to it over and over and I now have a headache. This isn't music folks and it is a sad tone-deaf society who thinks this CD is good. I want my money back!!!! I am beginning to believe that multiple purchase campaign thing about this CD, I hope to God there aren't 838,000 fools out there. Hopefully only 100,000 people purchased multiples with only a few suckers (like me) in between."
negative,"In the Trash When I Finished: This is one of those books that leaves you feeling as though you have had several hours of your life stolen from you, and sadly will never get the time back. The characters in the book do not keep in character. Not many pious devout priests would just decide to fornicate and not feel any guilt,or overnight completely lose faith. Berry did a reasonably good job of researching the Marian apparitions, and Vatican terminology, but he knows absolutely nothing of Catholic theology. Shame on whatever Catholic schools ""educated"" him. They failed. As another reviewer aptly put it, the ending was so blasphemous that it was almost humorous. Don't waste your time."
negative,NARJIS: I used them just for a few days . i bought a big box and put them on craigslist for baby dry lovers. but i will not recommend any one to usethem. Every time i had to change layers of clothing with diaper. bad on laundry budget.
positive,One of the best stories ever: I recomend this book to any young african american and women who are having problems at home and with their peers...Pick up this book...it will help alot. Wonderful book Sister Souljah
positive,"great classics for a great price: It is a great price for the classics that you get. There are also a bunch of random ones that my kids aren't interested it, but overall I would definitely recommend it! Great classics for a great price!"
negative,"Carnegie Aint what he used to be...: Dale carnegie wrote very well in his earlier works, this later work (assumedly from later in his life, or judging from the text possibly written postumously) is the worst thing i have ever seen in print.As an english professor it seemed sardonic to me to see someone write so poorly about the topic of speaking well. Perhaps i should have read this garabage aloud instead."
negative,i hate it: looks good only!!! :) you guys have to think twice or more before buy. make sure and odor and very dry
negative,"Better Than Battlefield Earth: A friend gave me this book knowing how little I thought of Battlefield Earth (Book & Movie). My biggest mistake was seeing the Battlefield Earth movie, despite reading the book.A Small Percentage was as predictable as Battlefield Earth, War of the Worlds, Santa vs. the Martians, and Independence Day. Mankind will prevail despite odds and technology.A Small Percentage did show the kind side of the aliens (Jenny) and the humans (Clay)"
positive,"welcome to world world: De Zengotita is a brilliant and elegant writer who is able to put clear words to vast and complex problems you've thought about and struggled with, but were unable to ever properly articulate--problems regarding where our relationship to the ever-expanding media might be leading us. Combining erudite philosophical insight, humanistic anthropological concerns, and highly readable language, he takes the hyper-self-conscious world of reality shows and 24 hour news in which we live, and questions the effects it is having on the way we think about ourselves, and the way we see what's around us. The examples he uses are absorbing, hilarious, and scarily dead on. This is the kind of book that changes you, and sends you back to the world with new weapons of perception..."
negative,"A poster? Really?: This ""poster"" looks like someone took pictures of a larger poster and cut and pasted sections together. Very disappointing!"
positive,Love My Tivo!!!!: This device is easy to install. I brought both two of these from this seller and the price is better than Tivo's. The shipping was quick. I wanted this device for a long time but couldn't seems to justify paying what Tivo was charging. I was browsing amazon and seen the same exact device's price and jumped right on it. I LOVE IT!!!
negative,"A Claustrophobic Mess: Bland characters, murky filming and gratuitous gore make for a horror movie mess in The Descent. I did not care one bit for the women or their fates. If there's a sequel, count me out."
negative,Fans can never be objective...: From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...more soundtrack pop full from Elton and whereas The Lion King is a 1 star album this is 2 stars because we have double the fluff.
negative,"Okay, a little too much of this!: This book was a disappointment to me in that it became very repetitious, much more than it needed to be. Ayla and Jondalar made their way to his people, and people there don't know what to make of her. The book goes on this way for awhile, and gets monotonous.A lot of scenery is described here as well.This is okay, but then, it just goes on a little too much. It has parts where some of the scenes get exciting, but not too often.When you read this, be prepared to yawn a little."
positive,"It Has Some Charm: This movie works for me. Yes there is some immature dialogue here and there and all turns out right in the end for the characters played by Swayze and Grey. However, it shows how love and affection can conquer all angles. It also shows the strengths and weakensses in both Swayze and Grey and Jerry Orbach for that matter. The Dance scenes are pretty captivating for the particular genre. Maybe not the most well developed story in the world but for a night when something relatively light will do, this flick will certainly fit the bill."
positive,"Lorna Doone - a Classic !: I was pleasantly surprised to find this book so readable- even by modern standards it is a good read, although the language in parts is somewhat old-fashioned, archaic even ..... but if you can deal with that, this is a good bet for anyone who would like a tale of England in the late 1600's... love, adventure, and even a little humor too!"
positive,"Good book, hard to reference: Alfred Edersheim is a scholar of unique perspective. He was born and raised a Jew but converted to Christianity as a young man. He provides insight into Jewish history and background to the gospel narratives like no one else I've read. A couple of problems with this work though, it can be very hard to reference. When searching for a particular parable or passage you have to search through the chapter headings one by one to see if you recognize the content. Furthermore, Mr. Edersheim is so unbelievably wordy it can be frustrating waiting for him to get to the point, but this is typical of late 19th and early 20th century biblical expositors. Overall this is a must in any self-respecting theologian's library."
positive,"What a wonderflway to love music!: It is a wonderful DVD, Gonzalez is creative, witti, and so relaxed as he introduces us to the world of music. Loved it!"
positive,"A wonderful sea story.: What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? There's a reason why it's a classic and why Jules Verne is still relevant after over one hundred years, he wrote some darn good stories! Every school child should read this book."
negative,"Santana - Live by Request: War Of The Worlds will about blow my windows out. I have the newest and greatest Home theater systems with 15"" speakers. This DVD is flat. Sounds like a mono system from the 50s"
negative,"WHY!!!!!: The first place I saw footage of this concert was on youtube and let me tell you I was blown away. The allman brothers band perform there best songs. So when I heard there was an official dvd release I was beside myself with excitment, That is until I read the reviews stating that this dvd only shows short segments of these performances intertwined with interviews and all I could think was WHY! why would the people in charge of releasing this do something so completely idiotic. This is a complete tragedy to think that this concert exsist in full on vhs but only in bits and peices on dvd. I can only hope that one day this company will have the common sense to release this in full as it was originally intended."
positive,"It Works Great!: It really works! This is my second one. I have the smaller one at my boyfriend's place. My laptop gets hot since it is a 12"" with a touchscreen. And I can really tell the difference. I give it 4 stars because it isn't the most comfortable for a lap but it isn't uncomfortable. I would really give it 4.5. And the mouse piece is great. Don't need it with the plus and small laptops but definitely need it for the smaller lapinator. JustMake sure you put the border on or the mouse slides off. The border foam is included. I bought two so I do love this product. It may have a silly name but it definitely works!"
positive,"A good trip back to the classics: Dabbling in a little bit of many masters of western thought, Denby skillfully uses his modern perspective to shed new light on these timeless works."
negative,Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck: The book is about two guys going from field to field for jobs. George is a small man that protects Lennie. Lennie is a very big man with the mind of a child. The story takes place on a field in California. I disliked the book because to me it was stipid. George is always yelling at Lennie and telling him what to do. Then what George does to Lennie at the end is sad and mean. you would need to read the book yourself to make a decision on it.
negative,"A great idea with poor execution: Our baby loves to be swaddled, so when she started to outgrow the receiving blankets we had, we purchased the Swaddle Me large size. It only comes in large or small. She was 14+ pounds when we bought it, so within their weight range for that size.It's a great idea, but the Swaddle Me is far far too big for her. It goes around her one a half times. It's as if the people who made the blanket never tested it on real babies. You can't make it tight enough to get that cozy feeling that is the whole point of swaddling. There is only a small space where the velcro tabs stick. I don't understand why they don't make the whole blanket sticky for the velcro (it's not scratchy) so that you could secure it as tightly or loosely as you need to.For our next baby I will purchase The Miracle Blanket instead, and that is what I would recommend to anyone looking for a swaddle blanket."
positive,Child called it: this book is so heart felt. He makes you wonder how the system failed him and many others. I always wondered how his mother was never charged of put in jail for life. The very least be treated the same way.
positive,"Another masterpiece by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins!!: Left Behind: The Kids 39, The Road to War is an awsome book. Anyone who reads this book would say that they couldn't stop turing the pages. It was captivating and the action never ended. The Road to War made me express every emotion know to man. I love this series. I would suggest the kids series and the adult series to any child or adult who is looking for a great Christian Fiction series. These books helped me develop a better relationship with Christ."
negative,"Thank You song: Fot those who are wondering the ""Thank You"" song is by Dido on the No Angel disc. Apparently not on this one though."
negative,"Deja Vu?: After seeing this movie, I felt like it was the same movie just with some line and character changes. Both have an old lady who dies listening to Robert Hays, it was funny in the first one but, come on, think of something different. Also, both talk about him escaping from the mental hospital. We know about that already it does not need to be said again, and I could go on and on. I laughed, but not because of this one, because it reminds me of the first one. The original part in this one that made me laugh was the court scene, other than that it is just an experience in deja vu. GRADE: D+"
positive,"Good action movie: Its really a collectors edition. All the 1st part of the movie series are the best, like wise.........."
negative,Depressing then becomes boring: my husband and I watched this and ended up watching something else. this will be a waste of your time
negative,"Disturbing: Am I the only one who was completely disturbed by the Madonna's character disgraceful deception? (Don't want to ruin it for the unwashed, but trust me, it doesn't matter.) To add insult to injury, we are subjected the the constant references to Madonna's beauty, considering that she looks well past 40 and tired thoughout the entire movie. We are treated to Madonna's moments of flexibility as a Yoga instructor. Be warned, Madonna is now sporting a British accent. The only bright light is Benjamin Bratt, who has absolutly nothing to work with. My suggestion is to gather some good friends and view it for the numerous yuks."
positive,"I liked it much more that the first CD...: I've enjoyed this CD so much! I bought ""Garbage"" and really liked it. Then my friend bought me ""Version 2.0"". I'm really impressed with the instrumentation and the lyrics. I think it flows better than the first CD too.Great music!!!"
negative,"Totally made me lose faith in my HS religious professor.: I went to a Catholic High School so I could stop being beaten in school every day. In sophmore year this was on the summer reading list. I felt it was an insult to my intelligence. And I really had no respect for Father Lauri when the class started in september. Very simple reading, maybe 5th grade level, which is concurrent with the kind of person who would read it. If you like this one, you may want to check out Dianetics as well, its just as inane."
positive,Swayze is hot. As always.: This movie first came out right about the time I should have been scandalized by it's contents. All my friends loved it. I think now I can actually appreciate it. Swayze truly knows how to move.
positive,"The Witch of Blackbird Pond Profiles: I believe that the author really out done himself with this fabulous book!The characters are great and unique in every way because each one has his or her own special ability a personality , and the setting is the best.Another great thing about this is that the time period was excellent, especially because witches mostly feared at that time."
positive,"Even better then expected!: I bought this to back up a failing hard drive in my 6 year old Dell laptop. It was very easy to use and is very well built. Since it is both IDE and ESATA, I have now used it to back up several other notebooks and laptops. It now functions as a portable hard drive.The software was also very easy to set up and use."
positive,"Not terrible, not great: Watch the first one before this one. Silent Night, Deadly Night, Part 1 would get 5 stars. This ""sequel"" re-hashes a lot of the same material but then goes off on its own. If you love horror movies, you must watch these movies!!"
positive,summary of a christ carol: my favorite part was when jacob marley showed up i liked the three spirits when they apeared i thought it could use some more pictures it also could tell what some of the words mean other than that it was pretty good
negative,really cute magnets but...: horrible set of grinders. these handles broke before i had the chance to refill them! waste of money.
positive,"Dirty Dancing: I am a fan of movies, all kinds and all eras. Dirty Dancing is a movie I saw on television so often that it almost seem to disappear while you were looking at it. I'd never seen it in the movie theater and I don't know that it mattered to me before I bought this DVD. However, I have a nice, large flat screen TV (like most of the USA) and when I played this DVD I was surprised and delighted. It was enchanting. The nostalgia was like visiting your past without the angst and acne. It felt good. I like a movie that makes me feel good. This is one of those films. Jennifer Gray is sweet and believable and Patrick Swayze is amazing to watch. Except for some of the obvious dialog and a naive plot line I loved it. Don't knock a naive plot line - it's sweet if it's in this movie."
negative,"Not bad, not great.: Bali is a clever pop offering but it's also over-reaching and too derivative for my tastes. Perhaps its only intention is to be an encomium of 60's pop. There are moments of brilliance. (Cellophane and Spoke of a Whirled Wheel being representative of that.) Does this cd draw me in and cause me to listen to it again and again as say Sgt Peppers or Pet Sounds does? Of course not. Is it entertaining? I suppose. There were moments when a chord change or selection of sounds caught me off guard but after a half dozen listenings I ended up skipping over a majority of the songs and the cd now sits in my kitchen underneath, I believe, a pile of papers."
positive,i think that this is a good movie: i thought this film was good it showed that this can really happen and does happen to kids around the world there's always going to be a guy who wants to sleep with every girl and not protect himself or his parter the film was smart i think that it was better that the actors were not experienced with acting that's what made the script so real the way that they talked even if they sounded stupid or immature this film captured truth and disbelief all at once i loved the movie!!!!
negative,Was not the best book i have ever read.: Farenheit 451 was just an ok book. I was lost most of the time and the book didn't really make too much sense to me. If i had to read this book over again i definitely wouldn't.
negative,"In a Nutshell: Mambo Murder: I've now seen the film Mean Guns twice and I have even purchased the DVD (albeit off of a bargain rack). This isn't a great film, it isn't even really a good film, but it can be entertaining if you like violence and mambo.The story behind the movie is weak at best and the cast (consisting mostly of Ice-T and Christopher Lambert) really doesn't do much to improve the film. There are some interesting action moments, all to the beat of Mambo music.If you can find it for a cheap price I'd suggest it, but I wouldn't pay any more than a couple of bucks for this film. Of course if you're a diehard Christopher Lambert fan or if you really love Mambo and Violence, this might be something you want to invest in."
positive,"Part number confusion: Amazon says Stant part number 10504 does not fit Chevy Silverado 5.3 engine, Stants own part look up says otherwise. This part DOES fit a Chevy Silverado."
positive,"Comfort after a semester of Philosophy of Religion: C.S. Lewis is one of the finest Christian thinkers of the modern era and this is one of his best works. He takes the task of explaining why Christians are Christians and makes it seem easy. There isn't a section that you'll read that won't apply to how you feel, he's right on target. If you have trouble understanding your faith, or explaining it to others, this is the book for you!"
positive,"Great system for the price...: Nice exhaust System especially for the price, but my stupid son decided he didn't like it after about a year and ripped it out and put up a cherry bomb held up by a coat hanger. He said it was rattling on the rear, but his jeep has a tank skid guard that affects the fit. He also said that one of the mounts rusted off, but he has taken his Cherokee four wheeling a lot and I think the hard bouncing and bumps may affect the durability on the tailpipe."
positive,"map puzzle: I bought this puzzle for my classroom of 4th through 6th graders. I received a puzzle like this when I was 11 years old, and was one of the few kids who really knew the USA! My students have that reputation as well. When most schools teach NOTHING about the states or their relation with each other (I know, none of my own children learned anything about this in school.), a child who plays with this puzzle will learn their USA having fun. It is the only US puzzle, to my knowledge, that has all the states cut individually. Most puzzles clump the small New England states together, which does a disservice to the children."
negative,"Would you like to know more?: Let me add a piece of advice to the ideas proposed in this book. When you hear the words, ""Would you like to know more?"" just say ""No thank you, and close the door. Closing the door is VERY important. When I lived in Salt Lake City, I had to learn to do that, because some people wouldn't take no for an answer. One furious Relief Society lady was so upset with my attitude of unbelief that she pointed to my dog and said, ""I suppose you think that dog is just as good as you are!"" I replied, ""Probably better."" and THEN I shut the door and watched through the window as her embarrased husband tried to lead her down the porch stairs. She must have spread the word in the neighborhood, because I wasn't bothered after that. Though this book poses some good questions, my advice is to not even get started or you are in for an evening of flip charts!"
negative,"Not for the serious minded..: Perhaps the larger model works well. This smaller magnetic set is tragic. The only upside is that if you're working on your grip strength, these will probably help. To get a useable amount of pepper, you'll have to squeeze 15-20 times. They feel cheap and destined for a quick trip to the trash can. Stick with a tried and true twist grinder."
negative,does not work: This format does not work on ps3 or Xbox 360 so I was unable to view it. I tried to ask for a refund with no response. It is the European format. They need to state it better when it is like that.
negative,"Hostel is better, but not by much.: i'll make my review short on this movie. it took 59 minutes to get to the ""good stuff"" and there wasn't much at that. you've seen all this before. no shock value here."
positive,"Very Fast Wireless Card: I am using this card with a Windows XP 32 Bit operating system, the card installed without a hitch and is faster than I expected. With the computer in the same room as my wireless card I don't even need to use the antenna. I am very impressed and it has worked flawlessly for me."
negative,A light skim: Not really the author's meatiest books and it doesnt really present a 'page turner' feel to it. I found myself bored thru parts of this book. Its a decent read but not a winner.
positive,"beautiful representation of janet as a person: this tour was very person and as janet represented from the start of the concert, an open book of HER story of her life, music, feelings and so forth. The concert begins with a big book being opened and then seperated into two screens then comes janet. She sings songs from velvet rope which are perfectly mixed with classic dance hits of hers over the years. A lot of the control and rhythm nation songs were made into medleys though some of the ones with intense choreography like If, Rhythm Nation and so forth were performed wonderfully. Janet also created great new chorography for what about, you and i get lonely which could have also been singles. I wish Everytime was sang on this show though that ballad is just so beautiful. It was great to see rope burn and special included."
negative,BIG NAMES/POOR RESULTS: Sorry BUT this entire production left me coldabsolutelyZERO WARMTH OR PASSIONVIEWED IT TWICE AND THEN HAPPILY SOLD IT
positive,"One big technofabulistic horror hoot!: Sometimes special effects, hambone performances, and knee-slapping puns make for a good movie.This is one of those movies. Great entertainment...lot's 'o fun!"
negative,"Over-produced junk: Simon Fuller has done it again, taken an average mediocre-talent and turned them into a media-made powerhouse of hometown glory and over-promoted love ballads. As with former Idol stars Kelly Clarkson (who was the runner-up and ironically had a better selling album) and Justin Guarini, Aiken's album is filled with a rare uptempo ballad, a medium tempo moody ballads and crooning slow colorless ballads. Even his linear notes are all-too-predictable, thanking his family and God -- sure to make any middle-aged housewife or grandma swoon.Overall, Aiken's ""Measure of a Man"" undeniably shows an aspiring talent at work (there is no denying his voice), but the lack of creative inspiration or even -anything- out of the box perhaps shows that Aiken hasn't actually measured up to the man he could be quite yet.If you're an aging house-wife or a grandparent you'll absolutely love this CD, but if you have any musical taste whatsoever you'll avoid it completely."
negative,"Horrible! Only lasted 1 month!: I bought one of these sharpeners for each teacher in our school. ""HEAVY-DUTY"" should mean it can withstand classroom use. However, after only 1 month, they are ALL broken! The motor simply stopped! Amazon won't let me return so I just threw away about $500 in taxpayer dollars."
positive,"Funny--especially if you're into SpongeBob.: I had the pleasure of seeing this movie ALONE in a movie theater. That's right--by coincidence, I was the only one in the theater.SpongeBob is a pretty good animated movie. The opening sequence is original and funny. For some reason, it wasn't quite as funny as the TV show is, but it was still pretty good. I missed SpongeBob's squirelly girlfriend, but other than that I enjoyed every minute.Best part: when Spongebob and Patrick dry up on land. Almost brings a tear to your eye! Worst part: Seeing David Hasselhoff's leg hair. Ugh!Overall, I recommend this movie to all Spongebob fans."
negative,"School Book review: I read the book 1984 by George Orwell for my book report in school. This is a book targeted for an older audience than an eighth grader. Its main theme, I believe, is that we cannot let our government have too much power. The government is controlling the peoples' lives with a fist as tight as possible. If we allowed them to do this, we will fall into dispair. All in all, I didn't care for this book all too much. It was all kind of above my head. It used ""Newspeak,"" past experiences, and things that just didn't make any sense to to me. I understand that most people really enjoyed this book. Maybe when I get older I will uderstand it more."
negative,"Don't bother.: I hated, hated, hated this book. It came highly recommended and I voluntarily (and rather enthusiastically) picked it up. There has never been a main character I have been more disgusted by, a storyline that has been less interesting, and a writing style that has been more obnoxious. I would burn it if it weren't borrowed."
negative,"Very Disappointed in Product Quality: After visiting a relative, I bought a Kuerig Platinum coffee maker and persuaded my mom and aunt to do the same. Now about a year later, all three of the coffee makers no longer work. We have tried everything in the manual to correct the problem without success. The water flow out of the coffee maker is so slow that you cannot even make a full cup of coffee and descaling does not help. I might be able to justify one of our coffee makers having a problem, but all three? When purchasing a coffee maker for $160.00, I certainly expect it to last longer than a year. Stay away from the Kuerig coffee maker or you'll be buying another one in a short amount of time. Very disappointed in the quality of this product and its longevity!"
positive,"A truly poignant, touching film: This is a fabulous movie adapted from a wonderful book. Both are worth purchasing. The novel is called ""Father of Frankenstein,"" by Christopher Bram. I read (and loved) the book before seeing the movie, and initially, I was hesitant to see the film version at all. So many film adaptations of great books excise the heart and soul of the original. But I was convinced to see the movie and was very pleasantly surprised. It is subtle, touching, and poignant. To sum it up: this movie is simply well written, well directed, well made, and especially well acted. Do yourself a favor and see this movie -- it is truly touching. But first, read the book. Both will impress you."
negative,"Cynicism at its best...: It's interesting to see how cynical a successfull author can be, and how popular such cynicism can be. Lord of the Flies might be a suspenseful and thought-provoking book, but it's main thesis --children turning into beasts as soon as the burden of civilization is taken off them-- is utterly silly. It makes me wonder how many children Mr. William Golding really knew or talked to before writing this book. Children are always capable (many times much more than grownups) to act with common-sense and responsibility. I think Mr. Golding knew this (he can't be that narrow-minded), but simply choose to forget it since it would destroy his thesis and he wouldn't be able to write this novel. It's also fun to see how easily some authors can ignore or blur the most simple realities. I don't recommend this book to anyone who loves children and childhood, which is a period of exploration and friendships."
positive,"Excellent book, Excellent Read.: I would recommend this book to anyone who is of the Ahl-as-Sunnah faith. The book approaches the life of Rasulullah (s.a.w.) in a much richer fashion and is an enjoyable read. It must be noted that the author of this book is the wife of a well known Naqshbandi Sheikh."
negative,Poor quality recording: The quality of the recording is very poor particularly after ripping it into itunes. The sound is empty. I would not buy this CD.
negative,"Pocket Neopets: I got this toy during the summer of '03 so I could have something to do on a long roadtrip I was going on. I love neopets, and I thought that a pocket neopet, would be similar to the site. Well it's not. It really boring. There is only four games that you can play. Negg Drop, Techno Says, Poogle Races and Fruit Machine. After about 20 minutes I got bored with the games. You can only earn Neopoints(neopets money) for the first couple of times you play. So I decided that I would buy some food and a toy for my neopet. Well there is only like 3 toys you can buy and 3 items of food you can buy. It's pretty boring. There is nothing else that you can really do. I put it in my junk drawer and havent taken it out sense. This is definatly not worth your money!"
positive,"Think of this as ""Smooth Blues"": I inherited a collection of CD's and this was among them...all I can say is WOW...I'd love to hear some of his older material because he sounds like someone that must have been an inspiration to Robert Cray. He seems to cross from singing what could almost be a Jazz Standard to blues in a vein similar to that (but not quite) of Robert Cray...great great stuff."
positive,"There's nothing profound in this movie, but...: ...it is gritty, suspenseful, and usually realistic. Fine acting and unobtrusive, effective music. Nothing profound, but highly entertaining."
positive,"Most Useful Dictionary: I have a 1971 copy of this dictionary which I am still using. Why? It is compact, the size of a typical short paperback novel, but it has more entries then many of the very big, but not easily handled dictionaries. The author just uses very brief definitions which most of the time is all I need. The result is that I have consistently used this dictionary since 1971 leaving the big dictionaries on the shelf."
positive,"Great Book: We must go forward, not backward. Upward, not forward. And forever twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom! I need more words for this review, so I'll mention that this is better than the movie."
negative,"Generic Garbage: If you've never played Texas Hold'Em, or better yet never even heard of the game, you may glean some new insight from this book. Otherwise it's a complete waste of money."
negative,"Not very useful: As far as I know, this is the first book on SQLite and for that Chris Newman deserves a compliment.Beyond that, this book is not very useful though:1) It explains some basic SQL syntax but I didn't buy this book to learn SQL.2) Very little information about the specifics and pitfalls of SQLite syntax, I rarely find what I'm looking for.3) Being a PHP developer I don't need the chapters on C++, Perl, TCL and Python (about 25% of the book)."
positive,"I saw it in 1988: I saw the movie in Czech Republic back in 1988. It was all in Russian on a black&white TV set. It was way before I saw the Star Wars movie for the first time. I tried many times to find out what movie that actually was. The only thing I was able to remember was the word ""Ecilop"". So today I finally looked it up and found this amazon item. I am ordering it as I type :-)"
negative,Court Jester DVD: I returned this DVD almost three weeks ago as it was for ZONE 1 rather than ZONE 4 [I am in Australia] so I was not able to use it. I am still waiting for some acknowlegement from Amazon that they have received it and if they will be sending me my money back or replacing the video.
negative,"Great if you like confusion....: This book frustrated me to no end. While I can respect the endeavor to write a book from the perspective of prehistoric man, it just didn't follow through. While Golding's theme of dichotomous man was intriguing, switching from character to character, not clarifying who was who, and the generally unengaging characters made this a very average reading experience for me."
positive,"Cavalier King Charles Spaniels In North America: I found this book to be a delight. Well worth having in a collection on this breed. It covers everything from the history of the breed to practical grooming, art, and much much more."
positive,"Exceptional film - genuinely funny, moving and entertaining: Genuinely funny and moving - exceptional film.This is an exceptional film that shows that no matter what life throws at you, the human spirit can survive and make a comeback. I love films that show you the inner strength of the human spirit and peoples faith. The film is genuinely affecting - it is funny, very moving and it looks exceptional on a big screen. Most of all though this film entertains without resorting to cliches and melodrama. Diane Lane is exceptional and deserves Oscar recognition for creating such a three dimensional and believable heroine. The acting from everyone is first rate and the direction is fresh and infectious. An exceptional film!"
negative,"I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH PREACHING THEY DO: This album is not good. It's not the voice I heard on American Idol, the voice on this CD is not even good enough for Broadway. The power exhibited on American Idol is lost in this CD, I'm sorry folks, call it what you want but this CD isn't Clay Aiken. The attempt to turn him into a Pop King has taken away that beautiful voice. BRING IT BACK and forget about pop. Billboard may have said it is Pop Album of the Year but they forgot to say they took the voice away to make it pop."
positive,"Windows Media Connect makes the DSM-320 sing!: A lot of the reviewers are dissatisfied by some things that are now remedied. Windows Media Connect(downloadable at the Microsoft web site) replaces the media server provided by D-Link. It now allows playing of media downloaded from online stores supported by Windows Media Connect (alas, not I-tunes). Play order from ripped CD's is now maintained. Some minor glitches still remain, but I'm very satisifed with it."
negative,"Is it a prologue? Or just a draft?: I was sadly disappointed, I have been waiting for years for this book and I feel cheated. It looks more like a first scenario which lacks substance (except for the excessive geographic details). I'm not questioning Ms.Auel Research, obviously it's extensive and thorough but this time it doesnt come through as it should and the plot (what there is of it) is sugarly and sketchy. It feels more like a prologue (which it probably is) to a new book, at the end you are left with a lot of loose ends, nothing is settled or properly developed. All in all a terrible let down."
negative,"Don't buy and read abridged classics - go for the real thing: It is not quite true that the publishers hide the fact that this is an abridged edition - it is printed under the title but is difficult to notice. After the 30 introductory pages you'll find a ""Translator's Note' that tells you that ""a distinct prejudice against length now exists"". Well, in my view it is a poor taste to shorten a classic book. The book is excellent but get the full version."
negative,"If this is the best, I'd hate to hear the worst.: A Friend of mine was listening to a tasty jazz CD at work. I asked him what it was and it was ""The best of Latin Jazz"" I should have checked the label because it was a different album than this one. How disappointing. If you dig Ricky Ricardo playing in a basement with 1930's recording equipment, then this is the disc for you. Where's Carmen Miranda when you need her? A couple of tracks approached cocktail hour banality, and THAT was the best. I want my money back."
positive,"I am still pleased!: Now that I am used to this cookware, I am so pleased with my purchase (I was used to using Mama's thick, heavy, iron cookware). I have had them for about a year now and, despite a little discoloration, they still cook everything perfectly, are a cinch to clean, and the handles are still on nice and tight. The two non-stick skillets have not scratched yet (I never use metal utensils with these). The only drawback to this set is that, because of the plastic handles, you cannot put them in the oven."
positive,"It is an AMAZING game but challenging to get the hang of.: I'm 9 years old and got this game for Christmas today. We tried and it is AWESOME!!!!!! Complicated rules,but still GREAT! It also teaches you a little physics because you have to hit your opponent's pharaoh with your lasers by moving the mirrors and bouncing the beam off the sides. I COMPLETELY recommend this game even though it's quite pricey (my mom payed $30), it is WORTH IT!!"
positive,"Sleeps through the nite.: The Pampers Baby Dry Diapers are great. If any mom's out their have a little one who screams the minute the pamper is soiled then this is a must have. The dry protection is so great my little 3 month old can sleep 8-9 hrs straight through the night with out a change. Plus I love the straight to my door process from Amazon mom, it is one less thing I have to worry about and can spend more time with my little one."
negative,"Get it from the library for FREE: So glad I didn't waste money in buying this book when the library had it for free. But still, I felt myself bored in reading it and wishing something, ANYthing interesting would happen. It was built up to look as if Marona or Brukeval would cause discord in Ayla's perfect world, but alas, nothing ever came of that. And each time Ayla met someone new I would just cringe knowing that ALL the titles were going to be repeated yet AGAIN. How tiresome did THAT become?! At least it wasn't AS repetitive as The Mammoth Hunters, but I still could have done without reading about all of Ayla's past in detail, over and over and over. And in this book, just as in the other books since Clan of the Cave Bear I was hoping Ayla would go back to the Clan to see Durc and to truly bring Broud down a notch or two, but didn't happen in this book either. This book was a big Y-A-W-N."
negative,"Pass this one up!: Should've been titled ""The Very Basics of Keno"". Could have been written in the 50's. Not much on ""Strategies"". Gave a few complicated ideas, but not clearly explained."
negative,"Disappointed: My wife and I are huge Clay fans. We were both very disappointed in the songs on this CD, with the exception of the title song. The background percussion was often overpowering. We also didn't like the ""boy band"" type songs on this CD. The only thing that is positive about the CD is Clay's amazing voice (to the extent it can be heard over the background noise)! We hope Clay's next CD will be produced by Neil Sedaka and focus on Clay's wonderful voice, with only minimal accompaniment."
negative,"it can't get any worse than this: it's just awful. although the movie is allegedly based on a famous novel by dumas (the three musketeers), the movie violates both the spirit and the plot of the original story. There is no Milady, D'Artagnan's young lover does not die, D'Artagnan does not go on a mission to the UK, and so forth and so on.What makes the movie truly unwatchable is not just the fact that it has little if anything to do with Dumas's masterpiece, but is the fact that the movie is phenomenally poorly scripted and equally poorly acted.don't waste your money buying this dvd. it's not worthy. it rarely gets any worse than this."
negative,"B-o-r-i-n-g: I was looking forward to reading this since all the reviews were so positive. What a disappointment! It's a story that really goes nowhere.--Just when you think something may happen, it doesn't and your left with a rambling tale of a boy's life. I did not find it clever or quotable. I consider myself a reader and found nothing in this book that stayed with me. I was happy to finish it just because I'm one of those people that hates to Not finish a book once i've started it. Thank God it wasn't a long book. That's the only good thing I can say about it."
negative,book report: This book was really just a book report on Lord Of the Rings and other geat novels. he put it into his own words and changed the names around but alot of the story was based on LOTR. I didnt realize this after reading them both. Their were a few things different so I give it two instead of one
positive,"An excellent ""fight"" movie.: This is one of Jean Claude's finer movies, if not his best. This is a classic beat em up movie and wastes little time with setting up a plot.It goes right into the action and stays there most of the time. The movie does a good job of making you dislike the bad guy and love the good guys.The bottom line? Get this movie if you are into classic fight movies, you won't regret it."
negative,"Watchable Alien Knock-off: This movie is a watchable Alien knock-off. It looks like a made for TV movie that was probably shown on the SCIFI channel. It has a heavy mix of CGI and live shots, most likely to keep costs down.But, the bottom line for me is that it's simply not interesting. It's a low budget film with flat uninteresting characters that relies heavily on cheap CGI to establish set placement. The funny thing is that if I saw this playing on TV I would change the channel because of the low budget production. So, why in the world would I want it in my DVD collection...This is a perfect example of a low budget movie that is bad, and don't get me wrong, I like low budget films. Low budget independant films give filmmakers chances to really explore their creativity. That's not the case here."
positive,"Very instructive and simple!: A rare book of astrology that provides detailed information and yet is simple to read, to understand and to remember."
positive,"Excellent!!!: I so ENJOYED this movie. The acting was superb, and the direction was crisp and sharp. The film-makers and actors had consulted with people and experts who had actually lived during the that ravenous Nazi era for authenticity and correctness of dress, speech, and the attitudes that prevailed.I thought I would be bored with the boxing sequences, but they were great; the friendship between the two leading actors was very strong and very poignant; the micro single-mindness of the Nazi regime of Napola certainly expressed the macro megalomanical mind of the German government at that time.I suggest that anyone who sees this movie also looks at the making of this movie to see how thorough the director and staff were to make this movie come alive. I was more impressed than I can convey."
positive,"Give in to the power of J: If you are an old 2SJ fan, you'll find enough classic 2SJ appeal to quench your thirst for those driving beats and hip-hop stylings. For the uninitiated, there is enough commercial slickness to songs like ""Grown Up"" and ""Lemon Drop"" to bring you over to the darkside. Give in before it destroys you!"
negative,"This is a Really Bad Movie!: You'd think on the strength of some of the actors and the director that this should be a pretty good movie. But, it isn't. It's sheer trash and I mean trash too. I haven't figured out yet why so many people are shown naked or with half their clothes off. One can only assume it's the director's idea. Why does Jennifer Jason Leigh go nude for half the picture? It makes no sense and neither does most of the film. There are just some disturbing images like a horrible pregnant woman running around acting crude and people writhing (of course) naked after being sliced in the head, dogs cut up and catipulted into a castle! It's just a pretty stupid movie. I'm just sorry it isn't a ""lost"" film where all copies known to exist just evaporated into thin air. A better movie that takes place a few decades before this one which takes place in 1501 isThe Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc."
negative,"great book, outrageous kindle price. Shame on Penguin: ""Dune"" is a wonderful book. I read it years ago and loved Herbert's talent for world-building. ""Fear is the mindkiller..."" is a mantra that I've used over and over.So why am I giving it a 1 star rating? Like other Kindle readers, I'm appalled at the price, which is actually higher than the price for the hardback. As other reviewers have pointed out, the Kindle edition is also highly flawed--formatting and spelling errors abound. Is it so much to ask the publisher to get it right? Also, this is a 40 year old book. Penguin has no business charging this much for a non-print edition of a book that is readily available in multiple editions used and is ten bucks new in paper."
positive,"One of my favorite books: I read this book in Spanish, and I loved it. The translation is a little corny in my opinion, starting with the title. Mastretta's characters are strong, independent, smart. Some of these translations make them sound, I don't know... (let's leave it at) less smart.Nevertheless the book in my opinion is very beautiful and human, and the translation only takes a little from its beauty. If you like romances with strong, interesting characters you will enjoy this book."
positive,"Happily, spookily imprisoned by the story: I read Sweet Dream Baby a few weeks ago, during a period of much stress & strife, and I loved it because I could get totally lost in it and in Travis' wonderful voice (also the great use of popular songs). I quickly ordered Sterling Watson's earlier book from Amazon, but was sorry to find no sequel that would allow me to see if and how Travis and the rest of his seemingly normal (at first), bizarre, sad family navigate the rest of their lives. Fun to read, beautifully written, thought-provoking, disturbing."
positive,"Good Morning!: This was my first book of this subject, actually given me by a friend. CAbot's writing is super, and this book taught me a lot. It's informative, instructional, humorous, and very useful to me. Thumbs up ^"
positive,"lovely: Practical Magic is my first Alice Hoffman book. It's a fairly quick read, with just the right dynamic of magic and reality. Hoffman's writing is at times sensual and moody; others it is light and subtle. It's a stirring contrast. Hoffman has a real knack for romance, too. The way she describes the various loves of the Owens girls is raw, dramatic, yet not completely unrealistic.Awesome book. I read it in two sittings."
positive,Mug warmer: I can't remember if I reviewed these or not. I bought two so I may have review one. If so I would like to add to that. At first I was a little disappointed in how the coffee wasn't kept as hot as I would like it. All in all I still like it because I drag out drinking a cup of coffee over a long period of time but dislike cold coffee. This improved this issue a lot. Later I happened to cover my mug with a cardboard coaster to keep dust out while I dusted (Yea my computer room doesn't get the care it should from me. About an hour later I remember it and took a drink and was surprised to find the coffee almost has hot as out of the pot. Needless to say I keep a Cardboard coaster handy. Plastic doesn't work well water drops form on it and get all over the desk. I highly recommend These to anyone who dislikes luke warm drinks.
negative,"Inspired work of fiction: I have studied late Ch'ing dynasty in detail from Chinese sources and can safely say that I have never encountered a more distorted and fictional view of the period. Seagrave's thesis that the 'evil legend' of Tz'u-hsi was invented by Bland and Backhouse is false: apart from the material based on the Ching-shan diary, virtually everything in 'China under the Empress Dowager' is based on authentic Chinese sources. Seagrave creates an imaginary political scenario of a court dominated by a fictitious 'Ironhat' clique. Virtually every page in this book contains some sort of error, distortion, sweeping judgement based on minimal evidence, fabrication or even an ocasional barefaced lie. If you want a true picture of the late Ch'ing, read Marina Warner's biography of Tz'u-hsi. A comprehensive and accurate account can be found in the five-volume 'Ch'ing-tai t'ung-shih' by Hsiao I-shan. Seagrave's book is an entertaining novel."
negative,you will not be able to buils a timber frame house: This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder.
negative,"How Can Sex and Sin Be So Boring?: Throughout this entire book, one part of my brain was in a state of wonder, trying to imagine how anyone could make a book about scandal, sin, adultery, public shame and cowardice so dull. To finish the book was a test of will, and was accomplished because I hate to leave things undone.There are many fine, engaging, interesting novels, both of our age and of Hawthorne's. I can't imagine why one would want to slog through this one."
negative,"Misrepresented Product: As advertised, the unit is portrayed as an APC OEM replacement cartridge with OEM APC parts. When the unit arrived it was clearly a remanufactured item using batteries from ""ABC"" (manufactured in Vietnam). The advertisement as presented does not mention that the item is a remanufactured part using non-OEM parts. This is my first experience with UnbeatableSale and it will certainly be my last."
negative,"BIG MESS: These diapers seem to have gone down hill fast with regards to quality. Over the past two packages (in a span of around 20 diapers) we have had two diapers burst open at night and deposit the inner crystals all over my toddler and his crib. A big mess and who knows the effects of the crystals? Also, my son has NEVER had a diaper rash and now has a severe case. Pampers Baby Dry diapers has been a good value in the past but will never use again."
negative,Too small: Usually a size XS to S but this girdle's small did not fit true to size. Had to return back to Amazon.
negative,"Makes Proust read like Elmore Leonard: This has to be one of the most over-written books in any genre. I could not believe the amount of space wasted in wordy, directionless exposition. The author should be cited by the EPA for the hapless trees that needed to be sacrificed to print this junk. Police work has never seemed so boring. The events in this book are built on coincidence and the lethargic will of the author; the investigators do nothing except stand around, talk in copspeak and react to the next transition in plot-which seems light years away to the reader. I truly cannot believe the number of people who rated this book highly. In one of Kirkus' other reviews, they equate Lindsey to Le Carre, a comparison that might ring true if Le Carre was drugged and beat about the head with a hammer before being positioned in front of his typewriter. Mercy blows more hot air than its Houston setting."
negative,"A big disappointment!!!: After seeing the film, I looked forward to reading the book it was based on. I loved the movie! Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the book. Usually, the book is better than the movie, but not in this case.I don't know how Powell was able to get this thing published, except that it was a novelty at the time. The writing is poor, and rambles on about nothing in particular. Not to mention the fact that her use of vulgarity is unnecessary and used way too often to suit any reader. Unlike the movie, the books dosen't go into the preparation of meals and the humor in preparing them. The only light present were the excerpts from Julia Child's life.All I can say in closing is stick with the movie. If you like the movie, don't read the book."
negative,"The speaker didn't work: I don't know what happened but when i plug it, the speaker didn't work. Maybe this device came damaged from the store. It's the first time that i received something damaged. Very Dissapointed."
positive,"L educates the masses dropping wisdom on her solo debut: I love The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill! It's a nice combo of soul, rap, and r&b and every track is phat. L-boggie drops mad wisdom and entrances us with her sweet, melodic voice. ""You can't match this/Rapper slash actress/More powerful than two Cleopatras"" This is a must have cd for all hip hop fans."
negative,"This book is a rip-off. Very disappointing: I really was dissapointed with this book.I thought I'd learn some ""insider secrets"" as Corey Rudl says in the title, but it only deals with general knowledge! This book is a compilation of some useless ""free reports"" that you can find anywhere on the internet...for free.Eric"
positive,"A Must-Read for all Parents of Children K-8: If you are assuming that your child's school is doing a fine job of educating your child or that your child's education is similar to the one you received, you must read Bennett's book. He carefully explains what to look for at your child's school and what your child should be learning and probably isn't learning. I recommend this book to all parents of k-8 children, especially those in the public schools."
positive,"Nice and easy to understand: This edition of Public Health education is an easy-to-understand version of those complicated ""big word"" editions. Mary-Jane Schneider presents each topic with layman's terms and the illustrations make it fun. The list of additional resources found in the chapters are also very helpful."
negative,"Very disappointing: bought this book eagerly because I'm a Civil War reenactor and love the period. This book is a major disappointment. The hero and heroine don't get together until the last third of the book. The war is little more than a backdrop ""Oh, this is going to be a terrible thing"" over and over. Instead of real romance, we get child molestation, slave concubinage, the obligatory PC horrors of slavery....gag. I wanted history and romance and this book fails to deliver. The author also made a few mistakes with her research and does a poor job of depicting historical figures such as General Lee, Stonewall Jackson and others. She tries to describe the heroine looking sexy in pantalets (which were out of style by the time of the war) and a camisole (which is an undergarment that didn't exist yet - women of the period wore chemises). If you want to read real Civil War romance written by somebody who really knows the period, buy Heather Graham instead."
negative,"The Most Overrated Album Of 1999: Upon getting this album I was incredibly exited because of all the good hype that I had heard. However little did I know that I was in for a horrible disappointment. This album is terrible. The only reason that people rave about it so much in my opinion is that they think that it is ""new"" and ""fresh,"" when infact it was a poorly made album by a poor artist. Moby takes old southern gospel tracks and tries to turn them into some sort of ""original techno."" Instead all he has done is take a bunch of dated songs that aren't very good to begin with and do what he does best, make them sound worse. Every Moby album that I have ever heard has been painful to my ears and Play seems to keep the tradition alive."
positive,Simply Amazing: The Zajirushi NS-ZCC10 rice cooker really does turn cheap and unappetizing rice into something delicious. I tested it with a batch of old cheap rice that was sitting in the cabinet (and with good reason) and it remarkably transformed the taste. The rice raw had that familiar unappealing smell to it that reflected its poor taste but after being cooked with this rice cooker there was no trace of it. Excellent product.
positive,"real country: I waited years for the vinyl to finally be released on cd. John Anderson is the real deal. This is what country sounds like without the glitter. Drawing from originals like Lefty Frizzell, Anderson's vocals are authentic; haunting on the sad songs. Great musicianship. I highly recommend it."
negative,"DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!: I had to read this book for my english teacher at my high school. I finished the book 3 weeks late, and the only reason I read it in the first place was because my teacher said read it or fail. Looking back I wish I would have just taken the zero, cause I failed anyway. If you have the choice for God's sake take the 0. They should re-name this book Retard on a Ranch."
positive,"Great info on hiking in the untamed wilderness: The book has great general info. on the numerous trails in our nation's biggest state. The information on trails that I hiked in the Palmer and Seward areas were right on the money, and I hope to use the guide on future trips up north."
positive,"Really Creepy Fun!: Occult Investigator is a thrilling look at a modern-day paranormal research outfit headed by author Bob Johnson.From werewolves in Van Nuys, California to Satanists living next door, the X-Investigations team are at the top of their game in this book.The stories are chilling and remind us that it's nice to have someone on your side when things go bump in the night!"
positive,"R is always off the hook..........: I just picked up this new Cd yesterday..... It is pretty much what I expected, which is that it would be the bomb; the only complaint I have is that it is a little repetitive- The songs are str8, they just sound really similar. But, saying that- this is R Kelly, and he can get away with it. I can't wait to put this disc to use in the bedroom, cuz we all know that's what R's music is really for!! One love..........."
positive,"Heart warming: This movie is no day at the beach. It is really nostalgic and sweet. If you are easily drawn to tears while you watch a movie, keep some kleenex handy. I watched it at a friend's house and now I am buying it for my mom. Good performances throughout by the cast."
negative,"A few comments on the graphic design.: The graphic design of the book jacket is rotten! The first four books, as they originally came out, followed a consistent and attractive design pattern, thus they look like a series on your shelf and are artistically pleasing. The new binding looks completely different -- simplistic, boring -- and the text in no way lines up with that of the previous books. I don't believe they're going to get people to re-buy the earlier books in the new design. And the new design is not a correction to the original design. The decision makers at Crown Publishers have once again shown a lacking in sense of aesthetics and a lack of concern for their customers."
positive,"Let's hope it sweeps the oscars!: Gladiator is a movie I saw a couple months ago and it still holds up in my opinion. Russell Crowe does a great performance as Maximus, a roman general who becomes a slave. Joaquin Phoenix is an excellent villian who is so evil you just want to gouge out his eyes with your bare hands. Like alot of epic films that get nominated for Best Picture at the oscars, Gladiator is long and a bit boring. But spectacular battles at the roman colosseum and great acting will keep you riveted right to the end. This film however should not be viewed by the weakened heart, due to graphic violence. But anyone who has a big set, is interested in the roman empire or who just likes great movies should watch this cinematic masterpiece."
positive,"Fascinating: Great murder mystery. This is one my favorite movies. I have rented it many times and thought it was about time to own it. Every time I watch Dead Again I catch some aspect of the movie that I missed before. It has many twists and turns. Just when you think you have the mystery solved, another character or idea comes into play. All acting is suberb. Kenneth Brannaugh's dual role as an American PI and German conductor is brilliant. The idea of a murder mystery involving reincarnation is fascinating!"
negative,"At the Mall!: I attempted to view this movie twice with equal disappointment both times. Granted, I was able to sit through the unrealistic ""Half Baked"" movie with a medium laughter scale, but this movie (which I thought was a match for Half Baked) was, indeed, not the icon it could have been. The movie's potential was lost after the first ten minutes and the ""Dude,"" ""Dude"" repetitiveness was spoken."
negative,"Realistic Review from a Gift Recipient: Hello, I was given this CD by a co-worker who wanted to Clay Forward with proceeds to go to the Aiken Foundation. I tried to be objective and as one who listens avidly to Streisand, Groban, and I am also a New Yorker who attends Broadway Plays, and the Opera, I was very optimistic. Clay Aiken is still young and has time to develop his voice. I was not impressed by this disc at all. It is light and popsy and not a very good first showing. I wish this young man luck in the future, he'll need it unless he gets better production help. If not, maybe I will catch him in one of the Broadway shows that I attend. He is at least THAT good.Thanks for the CD Sylvia."
negative,"it's a shame shame shame...: ..that julia child's name is even used in conjuction with this book. it should be called the whiny, unrelentingly self absorbed brat, julie powell & what she's complaining about today.. the woman has no talent. it gives me great pleasure knowing julia child never read this overpriced piece of crap! she used juila child to gain fame & tricked us all into believing she actually cared about her, about cooking & about being a decent writer. stick to your blogs, julie. that way you can just disappear into the masses of mediocre writers & name droppers where you belong. ps- i was routing for your husband to leave you the entire time."
negative,"A Real Snoozer: If you want to waste the time just borrow a friends copy but DON'T waste the money buying this novel yourself. I read another of Lance's books entitled ""A Byte of Charity"" and was hooked from the first chapter. However, ""Reel Pressure"" starts off really slow, picks up in the middle, and has an ending that seems to drag on forever leaving me with no feelings of satisfaction once I was finished. I don't know if that's his way of getting me to buy his next book but it didn't work."
positive,"I loved this book: I found this book so entertaining. It had the perfect mix of intrigue and historical details. Some historical fiction I've read tends to weigh you down with so many facts and names that the story is lost, but not so here. I felt the writer did a wonderful job of giving the events while sit keeping me totally engrossed in the story. It was one of those that keeps you turning pages into the wee hours of the night - definitely a good read!"
negative,Tiny Bible Tiny Print: The book was beautiful - but I was expecting to be able to actually read it - it has minute font size. My son saw it and loved it immediately - maybe because it is small and he loves the pictures - but the print is REALLY small & uncomfortable for me to read to him.
negative,"not so reckless: First of all, the wire came out as i was untangling the cord, so it is very fragile. It is too tall. It's ears are too high above my girl's clit for her too feel anything. It's not the greatest thing in the world, and i do not recommend that you buy it. huge disappointment."
negative,"Not a Large print in my opinion.: I don't know why would someone call it a Large print. It's a bit larger than a regular, but not what I expected. Returning it."
positive,"Estella in Great Expectations.: After doing numerous analysing on the novel, I find Estella the least developed of all the main characters in the book. The chapters in which she apperas in are short; her actions are small and her speeches are simplistic. I find it a pity that Charles Dickens did not actually further develope Estella and based the entire story on Pip"
negative,"Where's the feeling??........: Just got my copy of this a few days ago. I've spinned this disc at least 5 times since then, and nothing seems to impress me. I love black metal(usually the primitive sort), and love Frost's drumming, but this album justs goes down sour! There a few fleeting moments(track 3), but other than, it leaves me cold(and not in a good way). If you are a fan of hyperblast death black metal(Marduk, Setherial, Dark Funeral), then you might like this. One good thing, the vocals, sound exactly like Satyr. I'm still hoping it latches on to me later, I hate wasting money on CD's!!!!!"
positive,"A marvelous book for everyone who is young at heart...: As a mom, educator and counselor, I am overwhelmed by this book. It is a witty and delightful coming of age story about a young man who teaches us a valuable life lesson .... it makes us think about the cost of being with the ""popular kids""..... a universal issue. This book touches the heart strings of kids (younger and older than junior high) and adults alike.The guided questions lend itself to being in school libraries and classrooms. By discussion, readers can clarify their beliefs in a fun and interesting manner. This book is not judgmental, preachy or moralizing ... it merely teaches through the eyes of an unforgettable character ... Jason Green.For this holiday season, I cannot endorse this book enough."
negative,"Pretty bad choice of direction for Queen: What happened in 1980 that made a lot of good bands turn sour? Disco! Queen was a victim of the times and perhaps a horrible identity crisis. While Body Language still pops up on greatest hits packages, that track is not enough to warrant buying this album. Stick with Queen's 70's releases."
negative,"Not Widescreen: This is not a jab at Amazon, as Doc Hollywood is NOT available from Warner Bros. in anything other than full-screen, but how any studio can continue to sell full-screen-ONLY DVDs is beyond me. It's unforgivable. I won't even go into the inconvenience of the Warner snap-cases. I mistakenly read the specs and bought (and returned) this movie. If you expect to keep your 4:3 SD television for the next 10 years, and don't mind that you're missing about 1/3 of the original shot, then here's the movie for you. I really enjoy this movie, but I will not buy a 4:3 movie that wasn't shot originally in this format. As of Feb. 2009, standard analog (and I hope most 4:3 content) will migrate to widescreen/HD TV. All movies should offer a widescreen option. This, in my opinion, is the only positive outcome of the Blu-ray/HD-DVD conflict... but that's another story."
negative,"Not Even for the Most Devoted Fan: It's hard to believe that the man who wrote this book (and its equally disappointing predecessor, _Foundation's Edge_) even READ the original Foundation Trilogy, let alone wrote it.This book is repetitive, tedious, and unimaginative. The conversations about collectivism vs. individuality, repeated _ad nauseum_, for all the constant hashing and rehashing of those themes, do not even skim the surface of the points of contention between them.It's bad enough that this book isn't the least bit about the Foundation(s); the real problem is that it isn't even good science fiction, and worse still, it isn't even good writing. If you enjoyed the original Foundation Trilogy, please don't bother with the last two books (chronologically) in the series. They'll only ruin the whole experience.One star. Maybe less."
positive,"Mom Hates It; Son Enjoys It: We bought this DVD because our hard to please 2 year old absolutely loves the first one, Kid's Favorite Songs.Kid's Favorite Songs 2 consists of Elmo running around Sesame Street asking questions & recording kids talking about their favorite songs. Unlike the first, this DVD has a lot of cut scenes where children are talking about & singing parts of their favorite songs with no muppets in sight. The show then cuts into scenes where muppets sing the entire song the children were talking about. There is also a lot of cut scenes where strange cartoons are singing the songs instead of muppets.I enjoyed watching Kid's Favorite Songs with my son, but Kid's Favorite Songs 2? Not so much. If it were up to me entirely, I would rate this rather low, but my son seems to enjoy it for the most part & adores the parts where Elmo is present, & that's what's important."
positive,"Hoover U5507-900 Elite Rewind Bagless Upright: I am delighted with this vaccum cleaner!! We have 6 cats that live with us and after the first vaccum around the house, I was amazed at all the hair that was collected. The air even felt fresher! Can't say enough good things about this vaccum cleaner. I highly recommend it"
positive,Delightful...the second time too.: What a joy to read the wonderful creations of Tolkien's fertile imagination.Now on to the Lord of The Rings!
positive,"Totally AMAZING!!: Booker T. Washington not only exposes the evil of slavery, but the impeccable will of thoseparalyzed by it to fight for and enjoy the freedoms they never should've been denied to beginwith."
negative,"Oompa Loompa: I wanted to love this, I really did. Unfortunately, just like every other self tanner on the planet, I looked orange. That being said, I was not nearly as orange as some other products have made me, which made fixing my mistake with exfoliating a lot less difficult."
negative,I imagine if you get a working one this would be very useful.: I had to rate this low because the one I received was broken or had some sort of short in the wire and didn't work. I'm pretty sure a working one would be very useful.
positive,Beautifully written: A beautiful book Louisa May Alcott has a beautiful book written and I praise it for its beauty an wonderfulness
positive,"great movie: Great fun. Cher really shines in this movie, plays a great average woman. Not to mention nicholas cage is such anAdorable wako in this movie u just can't help but love him."
negative,"Fine at first...: After installing drive and software with ease, I sucessfully burned 2 audio cds and 3 data cds. Now for some reason it only works for data (pictures). Every time I try to burn a list of songs it errors out after a couple of songs resulting in many thrown out cds. I am definitely returning this one."
negative,"Holy holes in a story, Batman!: Trashing long-time characters wearies me. I won't divulge any key plot elements, but the solution to the mystery is such a stretch, it reminds me of when writers were commanded to have Alfred rise from the dead and be revealed as ""The Outsider"", way back in the early days of the ""new-look"" Batman. E.g., at one point, Hal Jordan, another DC character they keep re-trashing, who knows who the killer is since he's now the Spectre (whew!), tells Green Arrow to really punish said killer when they uncover him/her. Well, when you find out who the killer is, you'll realize that Hal would never have said that. Any rate, the motive for the murder is so convoluted, all I can say is, DC should let the pros (Frank Miller, Alan Moore, Keith Giffin) write these epics. And enough with killing and defiling the memories of long-time characters!"
negative,"BEWARE!!!: This was a good movie from an artistic perspective, like what everyone else said so far (very very slow, quiet etc.). However only one person mentioned the fact that there is a gay scene. There is a gay scene! By gay scene I mean two guys making-out on a bed.I I guess it could be worse, but (being hetero) I had a hard time accepting it's connection to Kurt Cobain. I Just have to make sure you all know what you're getting in to."
positive,"Reviews - appropriate or not?: I believe that everyone is entitled to his/her opinions, but I've noticed more and more reviews that aren't only insulting to the authors and other reviewers, but don't even address aspects of the book in the first place, i.e. its plot or character development. The reviewer that wrote ""this book and others like it so insult the intelligence of anyone with half a brain..."", is plainly criticizing all romance novels in general. And by his/her rude statement insults not only the author but those people that enjoys a romance novel. Was that really appropriate? I may not prefer romance novels myself, but I think that we should respect that everyone has different preference. Romance novels may not be ""substantial"" to some, but I think for a lot of people it offers a short enjoyable break from their everyday life and that's definitely of great ""substance""!"
positive,"One huge reason to be optimistic: I actually thought the first Spiderman movie was fairly boring, and for the same reason that most super hero movies are boring: a very bad script. I honestly don't know if the second one will be any better, but there is hope! After the phenomenal critical success of the book THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY, which tells the story of two young comic book writers from the early days of WW II, Michael Chabon was asked to write the story for Spiderman II. If you have read that novel, you know what extraordinary ideas he has for comic book stories. There is a very, very good chance that he can elevate SPIDERMAN II to a good space. I actually read an interview with Toby McGuire where he talked about how good he thought the script was.So, keep your hopes up folks! Thanks to Michael Chabon, the second film just might be a very good one."
positive,Works well: It heats a cup of water up to very warm at night. Coming back to buy a couple more for parents.
positive,"a classic not for beginners....: ....but a daring example of the willingness of a thinker to make fundamental changes to his theoretical framework very late in his career. This is where Freud shifts his emphasis from ego vs. id instincts to the famous Eros/death polarity, clinically questionable but archetypally informative."
negative,"truly dismal!: Wow I was amazed at how terrible this movie was -- the acting was bad bad bad. I don't recommend even spending the small amount, not worth your time."
positive,"One of Fox's better work: It is a real shame that illness has struck down Michael Fox. I only hope that things will change for the better for him. Anyway, While I liked his Back to the Future Series. Doc Hollywood is far and beyond the better film. What with a stronger plot, sharper writing, a charming and talented cast is it no wonder that I feel that this film will stand the test of time? So if you want to spend some time and walk away with a good feeling in your heart then give this film a shot."
negative,"Guide to complete dishonesty and cheating and lying yourself and everyone else: This book is written unfortunatey by someone who has problems against the world.It teaches you how to cheat, lie to everyone, fake orgasms, forget who you are,and just be a complete bitch - and everyone will hate you for that.So if you want to ruin your life, do as it is written in this book..."
positive,"Its a book, but with audio and video: good book even though it is the umpteenth time I have read it but the first time in digital format. Had issues with the audio/video on the iPhone and had to uninstall and reinstall the book and the app more than once to get it to work right."
positive,"a teen reader from CHA: MAY17,2001YES, I HAVE READ lITTLE WOMEN. I ENJOYED THE BOOK BECAUSE FOR ONE IT WAS DURING THE TIME OF THE CIVL WAR TIMES,AND BECAUSE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE READING ABOUT MY SISTERS."
negative,"I really wanted to like this, but it just isn't happening: Let me first say I love Alyson Hannigan. I really wanted to like this movie given this is her first major movie role.But alas, this movie is crap. With the exception of a few chuckles here and there, this is something to watch while you're websurfing or talking on the phone - giving it your full attention is not only unnecessary but almost painful. The jokes are bad, predictable, and worst of all, not funny.If you have any interest in this movie I strongly recommend you RENT IT first before you spend money on it.I can only hope that Alyson's next movie is of higher caliber. :("
negative,"jog dial runs away: I bought this phone quite a while ago. It was great at first, but now the jog dial has just gone crazy. The slightest touch causes it to jump wildly (or not move at all), rendering it close to useless. I rarely get channel searching or static as some others have mentioned."
positive,I have always Thought Rod Is One Of The Great Rockers!: I have 11 CD's of Rod Stewart and this CD adds to his collection! His unique voice and style are great! Well worth the purchase!
negative,"Kindle version of this book is NOT coimplete: Amazon won't tell you, and you will learn only after you pay for this Kindle title: it has no illustrations or photos and has regrouped the footnotes to the point of making them worthless. A very disappointing result for a fine book with great crime history relevance. This title should NOT be purchased for Kindle if you are expecting to receive an honest copy of the complete book! I will not trust other Kindle titles because unless you own a print copy of a Kindle title you will never know what was omitted, removed or edited to fit an obviously limted format."
negative,"This sucks: Look, here it is. I know everyone says how great and everything Othello is and that this Shakespeare guy is like a genius. But what it comes down to is it is just like this white guy from Ireland who never went to Italy and stuff and like all his plays all take place there and stuff. I mean, did Shakespeare actually know someone named Romeo? But that's not the point. This whole play sucks. I didn't get involved at all and I couldn't relate to none of the characters. Plus when my teacher said that Othello is actually black, I, as a white person, took offense to it. So to all you out there in cyber space, just avoid this no matter what. And if you were like assigned it for class say that you won't tolerate racial prejudice. Or read the Cliff Notes, like I did."
positive,"K&N Air Filter: Fits better than OEM, functional and best of all, it's reuseable. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase through Amazon, always like the free shipping deals."
positive,"Great Music- Great Production: We first rented just to see it, when we returned it we went out and bought the movie, we just couldn't do without it. We first saw it five days ago and already we know most of the songs. I really love the Narrator she is one of the best characters in the movie. Also, I thought Elvis is really funny, but I think my favorite part of the movie is the 70s' song. Donny Osmand as 'Joseph' was a really good idea, he is so good looking you just like the movie as soon as he appears singing ""I closed my eyes"". I just LOVE that movie."
negative,"If you like plot-driven novels.....: Then this book isn't for you. I gave it an extra star because it really is well-written but, my God, how boring! I'll never understand why books like this win prizes. I finished the book with a hope and a prayer that something would happen. Please someone get killed or pregnant or arrested or something! The only time things actually moved along were the last 30 pages. It seemed liked it was about the family throwing jabs at each other and everyone else. The family on vacation; the father running for office; the daughter and her manic-depression. I was constantly wondering ""what did they mean by that?"". Since the book is set in London and the author is a Brit. there were references and some slang that I simply could not understand being an American. I might even try to rent the movie -- maybe that was more interesting?I don't see myself going out and trying to find another Hollinghurst novel."
positive,"EXCELLENT: Eddie Palmieri, like most early-1970s jazz players, must have known popular music had taken over the world and caught the bug.Whether he wanted to make money or just expand his horizons, it really doesn't matter.He formed this band, Harlem River Drive, in 1970, and made one hell of an album. Truth be told, this project does not have much to do with the Latin Jazz Eddie is known for. Harlem River Drive is an out and out soul funk album: wha whas, grooving percussion, all the ingredients you would expect from a crack unit during the era.And more: with a baritone sax--an extremely underused instrument in all genres--in front, this album has a uniquely jazzy flavor, even though the beats could be off a Santana or War or Mandrel album.As funk, it works full bore, but the novel textures here make an already fantastic funk project so much more."
positive,"Great for a first album: I love all the songs on the album and its a great first album. I feel the song ""touch"" is probably my favorite and then the next would be ""The Way"" and both would do very well on the charts if released as a single. Clay definitely does sound different than A I and in some aspects I miss that amazing vocal range he has which is clearly not expressed as much on his debut CD. All and all the CD is very good but I hope for this next album there are songs that have more of a range in them."
positive,"They're all good!: Upon hearing ""How it feels..."", I was blown away by the overpowering musicianship, as well as the different ranges Jeremy sings in. Although it lacks the driving breakdowns and pure ""rock"" moments of the past, it most definetly is an album that changes for the better. I feel this is a more mature album, by a matured band. Every song has its own special appeal, that keeps you listening (like I would have turned it off anyway). It's also a great album to listen to after smokin' a few jizoints, or before bed!"
positive,"Somewhat Difficult yet Fun: The Sunsout No Room at The Inn Puzzle has oddly shaped pieces that are somewhat difficult to put together. I am currently still working on it, but so far, it looks great! I would recommend this puzzle to anyone with a little extra time on their hands and the love of solving puzzles. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
positive,"An Excellent Catholic Bible Study Resource: This latest installment in the wonderful ""Come and See"" Catholic Bible Study program by Fr. Jospeh Ponessa and Laurie Watson Manhardt is a comprehensive look at eleven Old Testament prophets, as well as the Epistles of the New Testament. The book's introduction sets the stage for the study, explaining materials necessary, how to get started, and helpful suggestions for starting a group study. The book has equal value for individuals looking to work their way through the Bible study process on their own. Of particular importance in this study is the fact that it emphasizes the role of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Study participants are directed to relevant and appropriate references in the Catechism to compliment their study of scripture. A great resource for groups or individuals!"
positive,"WHY MEN LOVE BITCHES: Wonderful, enlightening book. I think every mother should provide to daughters at the ages of 14 - 15. I believe every adult woman should read also."
positive,"The last great album by Queen: This album documents Queen's last album as a confident band. After this, everything changes, and they start doing stuff to please others rather than themselves. They would never, for instance, produce a pop classic like ""Calling All Girls."" The muddied production that scars the rest of their albums, as well as quoting their own songs, is not present on Hot Space. Sure, there's wimpy electronic drums, but there is on Prince albums, too. It's the songs that are strong, and they're not afraid to do funky stuff, following thier bliss. I abhore the revisionist Brian May, going on about how he hated doing the funky stuff. Listen to his solo on ""Back Chat."" I really think this album is a document of a band at a crossroads. Fans who have listed to Greatest Hits and likes it should by this album well before Innuendo, The Miracle, and Made in Heaven."
positive,Mg citrate - works well for my visual migraines: My doctor suggested magnesium citrate for my visual migraines. This product is the best-priced I've found and it works well.
negative,"What was he thinking?: I was extremely disappointed with the entire book. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it might get better. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and missing nothing in the process. The characters are all completely forgettable, and so is the story. The end was predictable, and any moron could have guessed why the jurors were being eliminated.Please don't write another book, Mr. Grisham.This was a complete waste of time."
positive,"Pretty Good: Unlike other reviewers, I found this book to be an excellent exam prep. tool for my first MCP exam. Do not rely on this book entirely - FP98 Unleashed is an excellent supplement - but for actual exam type questions, I found this book invaluable for passing the test."
negative,"Jurassic Rock: Sorry, but the Rolling Stones are no longer relevant - unless you count the intriguing oddity of ""Sweet Neo Con."" Try as they might, ""A Bigger Bang"" is largely a bust. It's too bad that Mick, Keith and company didn't pull the plug after ""Tattoo You"" (1981). For the past 20 years, the Stones have existed as a well-paid oldies act. ""A Bigger Bang"" fails to reverse the group's sad decline."
negative,Have not received my order yet: I have not received my order yet so I cannot review the book; however all the Kathy Reich books I have read so far have been enjoyable reads.
negative,"Pass the Dramamine.: Watching this, you just KNOW that important bits were edited out to protect the current reputation of Ms. Hurley. The ending just comes out of left field - adding to the impression that something was taken out. There are hints of a more than sisterly relationship between the two female leads but not enough to shore up the finale. The only saving grace is the price is right!"
negative,Horrible Horrible...Just Go to Borders: I ordered this item on or around August 15th. It is September 13th and I have still not received this item. I emailed the shipper on numerous occasions about the item. The shipper even went as far as to lie and state that my shipping information was lost. I provided the shipper with my shipping information yet again and still did not receive the book not to mention the shipper stopped responding to my emails. Needless to say I had to file a claim with Amazon and I just went and bought the book from Borders....just buy books or whatever else this shipper is selling elsewhere...it may be more but at least you will get your item!
negative,"A very simplistic telling of a few stories from WW2.: This book is written in the same manner as the news is read on television, in little sound bites. There is not much ""meat"" in the brief stories included. Brokaw chose to include political correctness which made me wonder why he called it ""The Greatest Generation"". He manages to tarnish that generation by judging historical events using today's values. Overall I thought the book rather boring."
positive,"A must read for fans: I just finished reading this wonderful book about the Northern European myths that Tolkien borrowed and reshaped to make the lands, people, and languages of Middle-earth come alive. For the price and content, this is a great value. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Tolkien's fiction!"""
positive,Good: This is an excellent item. The seller shipped fast and I am 100% satisfied with the overall transaction. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
negative,Sick and demented: I had the same reaction to this film as the hero had to crime after his treatment.
positive,misunderstood movie: at first the movie was a bit difficult to understand and it took me a few times to see it and it finally came to light.harry had a few problems but he stuck with it and overcame them.he was tricked into going through the test in the movie.my favorite part of the movie is the maze.I loved the climax of the movie
negative,"Piece of Junk: I bought this for long trips and expected way more than what we recieved. After one hour it started to freeze, play for a few minutes, and then freeze again over and over. Finally it skipped all the way to the ending credits from the middle of the movie. I heard great reviews, but it is a lousy machine. I'll wait for better quality at a lower price."
negative,"Garbage written by a sellout looking for help.: Like any sell out of their own, she now cries for protection. She has reaped what she and her kind sowed. 20 years ago, the forwarnings of this where well known, but people like Catherine denounced them as racist bigots, so such. Now, like the sell-out then and now reaping her eternal benifits of such, should now be allowed to stew in a sewer of her own making. Tough Luck kid, maybe next life you won't sell out."
negative,"Underachieving film about overachievers: This film starts out promisingly with some beautiful photography showing Indiana in the fall. It soon bogs down to repetitious basketball footage and cliche characters going about their wretched lives pointlessly. If you like shots of basketballs bouncing off of backboards, this film might be entertaining. To me, it was like being hit in the face continually with a basketball for the better part of two hours.Oh well, it beats watching the NBA."
negative,"The Truth about the Titanic: Sadly, I was greatly disappointed. One of the first books I just stopped reading because it wasn't good. I could never ascertain if it was truth or fiction and quite frankly, the writing just wasn't good."
positive,"fun characters: This movie has an interesting plot without the nonsense of an unnecessary backstory. The characters are fun to watch because they are extreme examples of every one of us. Although many people will deny it, I think that all of us can identify with one of the stereotype characters in this movie. Although the characters are over the top, I truly like everyone in the film and found myself talking to the screen, telling the characters to run or be quiet or whatever would save them. All in all, a fun movie and quite entertaining."
positive,"4 good movies for this price!: How could you possibly go wrong with these 4 movies and at this price, excellent buy and you can sit back and laugh all day. Treat yourself and get it!"
negative,"Boring and/or Unsettling: This mnovie was a complete waste of time for someone who, like me, did not have a grip on who Diane Arbus was. It is indeed ""creepy"" as one reviewer said, and got to be laughable at the end. All I wanted to do at the end of the movie was forget it, which is something I don't usually do. A little explanation of who she was and how she ended up would have been nice, but without that, it was a very boring and yet somehow unsettling movie! Extremely slow as well, and a waste of the talents of these two actors."
negative,"Boots: The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.Drop ya boots, dawg!!!It"
negative,"Dissatisfied: I purchased the B60 model. I enjoyed the convenience and the flavor. It lasted less than a year. I was not able to solve the problem so that investment was wasted. I looked online in an attempt to remedy the situation and found many others with the same problem. Some had been able to resolve but none of the suggested solutions worked for mr, not even the one proposed by the guy who slaps his around. Reliability of this product deserves less than zero. $100. For a few months of coffee is a rip off."
negative,"""Too Basic"" is ""Too Kind"" to this DVD: I agree with everything in the ""Too Kind"" review. The contents of this DVD could easily fit into a couple of chapters of a basic billiards book. If you are just starting out, and I mean JUST starting out, this DVD has about $5 worth of good information."
positive,"Great guide, but outdated: Lonely Planet guides are the best out there, by far, at least for people who travel with a budget and only a pack on their backs, stay at hostels, and like to really experience a new location without being so touristy (Fodor's guides, for example, are the opposite of Lonely Planet's and are written for the upscale traveler). The California/Nevada guide is no exception, but it's just too outdated (published in 1996), and I wouldn't recommend buying it and instead would recommend waiting until the come out with a new one, whenever that will be. That's the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars. They did just put out a new San Francisco one though ..."
negative,"Died after 4 months and tech support is horrible...: I read the reviews before purchasing this adapter, and I guess I simply got a dud. That happens, but the tech support is horrible. The support staff was very unhelpful and told me it would take weeks to replace.The other adapter replacements don't seem much better, given the poor reviews for Kensington's model.Just hope you don't get a dud."
positive,"Play - by Moby: This is the album that got me hooked on Moby. I've been a fan ever since.It goes without saying, I recommend it very highly."
positive,A wonderful purchase: This DVD was a great investment. I was pregnant with my second daughter when I bought this DVD trying to avoid taking a Lamaze class and it totally did the trick. I felt better informed and prepared for natural child birth and how to avoid unnecessary interventions. I recommend this for any new or repeat Mommy's.
positive,"Stunning: I have just a few things to say. Stunning. The CG in this blasts Titanic out of the water. Where in Titanic you can tell where the real people end and CG begins, I was stunned to find out that Gladiator had CG. I liter5ally could not tell. As a computer arts major, I pride myself on being able to critique the cg, beind able to tell when they haven't used enough layers to make it the CG look real, or whether the peopl in the background aren't quite as smooth as they could be. Gladiator stuns and mazes you with not just a brillant story , but Ripley Scotts legendary amazing viewpoint and telling of Maximus' story and the landscape surrounding him- reminiscant of Bladerunner's majestic run down dark city it's run down hero, Decker.It's a movie worth it's cost and is somethign to be watched along with Spartacus and Ben Hur. Just Glorius."
positive,Great Quality and shipping time: I would like to thank the seller for the great quality and the fast shipping :) i really liked your service
positive,"Beautiful glasses at a great price!: These are very attractive looking glasses that feel very nice. They are well made and not flimsy, yet they are not heavy to hold. They make whatever you are drinking seem to be more of a treat."
positive,"Too soon to tell.: It has a very attractive cover. Got the book about a week ago. I have 165 books to read before I get to this one, but since I'm moving to Mexico in a few months, I thought I'd better put it in my library now. Write me in a couple of years and I'll be happy to tell you what I think of it.Regards,Gerald CampBook Collector"
positive,Good for the price: I had been looking for a spare set of flannel sheets for my bed. These are not the best but they certainly are good enough. They are a bit thin but soft and warm. I do recommend them.
positive,"The Best Lottery Guite Ever!: I just love this book. It's really amazing. I read Gail Howard's columns in lottery magazines. I know she has had many ""lottery"" winners using her books, but I think this book is the best of all of them. I can't rave enough."
negative,"Prehistorical Meandering Story: The plot of Clan or the Cave Bear is ok, but I found myself skipping alot as the narrator goes on and on and on. For example, every time the protagonist goes herb gathering with her mentor, 2-3 pages are dedicated to describing the herbs and techniques. A short description would've added some depth to the story, but I really wasn't reading the book to get a lecture on neanderthal medicine.The characters are the saving grace of this story, adding entertainment and almost overcoming the sorry narrative. Almost, overall this book is very boring.One gets the feeling that Auel is trying to make a statement about feminism or male-female relationships, but whatever point the author is trying to make is not clear.I think my money would've been better spent on something else."
positive,good price: I bought it for my kid to use after school study. Hope he uses it to improve his word power.
positive,"Excellent Live Project: 2000 release features 4 new studio songs and 10 live unplugged acoustic songs (8 from The Metro Theatre, Sydney 1994 and 2 from MTV Unplugged 1993). This limited edition Australian import does the standard version one better by including an additional bonus disc with multimedia content (including videos of two songs) and an extended interview."
positive,"Great Shoes: The shoes are really great and the quality is really good as well. The only thing that wasn't quite right is the color of the shoes on the picture. The inside of the shoes on the pictures look more red, but in reality the inside is more of an orange color. But it isn't a big deal to me.I was really (positive) surprised by the seller. The shipping was extremely fast and the customer service is outstanding! I have no problem recommending this seller to others!"
negative,Poor Design: I would not buy this product or reccomend it. It is designed poorly and the different attachements don't stay on the charger. Disapointed withmoney spent
positive,Love these books!: We loved the Boynton books when our kids were growing up. These are the kind of books you read over and over and over again and again. We gave this set as a baby gift to friends and hope they enjoy them as much as our kids did. These books are so funny and the pictures are great.
negative,polar storm: Can't watch this dvd has everytime I put in on a screen appears that says This film can not be viewed in your area. What a con!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative,"A Generation of Whiners: Sorry to say it, but this was (and is) a generation of brave individuals who now grumble relentlessly about how ""kids today never had to work for anything, everything was just handed to them."" Right -- and they had to walk 50 miles to school everyday through the snow. Listen: I'm a Boomer. My parents had nothing -- nothing! Everything I have, I've worked damned hard for! And I had the common sense to stand up and speak out against Vietnam. Ask the Greatest Generation how they spoke out against McCarthyism, racism, intolerance, bigotry and the like. This is a revisionist view of history -- the winners pounding themselves on their backs, and looking down on everyone else. Tom Brokaw should be ashamed of his lack of journalistic objectivity."
positive,"Great for mature Sixth Graders!: I use Romeo and Juliet as a unit in my literature class, but only when I have a mature class of Sixth Graders. Therefore, I do not use it every year. After a lesson on pronouncing some of the English and what it means, I pick the best readers to do the reading, and switch off daily. We also study the conflicts and do quite an indepth study of the play. They love it!! I end with the Zefferelli version of Romeo and Juliet on Video. The Dover Press edition makes it affordable to buy every student a copy for them to make notes in and keep when we are done!!!"
positive,Classical perfection: Tess of the d'Urbervilles is possibly my favorite classic. Thomas Hardy is a brilliant writer as evidened by this novel. If you've never read it please do so. It's free on Amazon. You will fall in love with Tess and curse the life she is dealt.
negative,"Brenda, B: This is a good ideal but you need to be measures for the right size.I have order the 2xx and it was to little and I order the 3xx and the legs or the bottom part was to big. But I have the Squeem Rubber High Back Waist Cincher Girdle Style 26J in 2xx and it fitted well."
positive,"The real Ben: I knew Ben Franklin, Ben was a friend of mine and sir this is the real Ben Franklin. Good book. Helps explain the goings on in pre revolutionary war."
negative,"Definitely not for me.: I didn't like this book at all when I read it as required summer reading. It wasn't very interesting and for the most part it was difficult to understand. I still haven't completely grasped the concept of why it was called ""Lord of the Flies"" even though it was explained to me many times. I cannot grasp the smaller themes in the book, but I did understand the overall theme. I had a very bad opinion of this book until I went back to school and parts of it were read aloud to me. I think that this book is much better when read aloud and with emotion, however it was not for me."
negative,Color was really disappointing: I ordered the Kiwi color which arrived looking faded and worn out just out of the box. Color doesn't look anything like the photo. Not worth the money.
positive,"What took me so long?!: Why did I wait so long to get this book I had heard so much about??? It is fantastic - so quick, great recipes, great photography....and easy to make your dish look like the photo!"
positive,"Classic Christie: APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH is a perfect example of Agatha Christie's work; exotic locale, cast of interesting and varied characters, and, of course, MURDER. There are other Christie books that are more exciting or more clever than this, but she is in top form here. Characterizations have a bit more psychological depth here than in her other books; the monstrous mother and the near-psychotic daughter, in particular, stand out as memorable creations.Read the book and the play; Christie adapted the novel for the stage herself, and made two changes: she removed Poirot, and changed the identity of the murderer. Typical of Christie, both versions of the story work equally well."
negative,"Badly written fiction: I first picked this up 15 years ago more to get it off the shelves of the used bookstore than to actually read it. I already knew its reputation then but I did try glancing through it. By the time I hit the infamous list of lies he cobbled together, the book was already getting unwieldy with all the post-it notes I'd put in with refutations to the flat out lies the author tries to pass off as facts, never mind all the cases where he took something that might have resembled truth if in the right light and twisted it to an extent that the last vestige of accuracy was lost in the swamp of fiction and bigotry present in the mind of the author."
negative,"Never Again: I decided to try these diapers instead of the swaddlers to save a few dollars. Needless to say that was a mistake. They claim to keep baby dry for up to 12 hours. My little one can't use these to sleep through the night (6 hours). I don't recommend these at all. Spend a few extra dollars on the swaddlers, you'll make your money back on the $ saved on extra laundry they cause because they leak."
positive,"excellent!: I have used this hair dryer for many years, and mine just gave out. So I am buying two more to have on hand. It is the only one that has gotten my thick hair straignt with body. I love this product."
negative,"What were they thinking: Picture yourself standing behind a pole watching a concert. You would have been better off that the view you get from this video. I can't believe the Bad Religion boys would put out junk like this. The audio and video quality is terrible, absolutely terrible.There are plenty of songs to see them perform live, but your only perspective is off the stage to the left with a tiny camera held in someones hand. Don't waste your money on this."
positive,"very pleased: We are very pleased with our new scale, it works great. It was easy to assemble too. They shipped it right away. Bev"
negative,"interesting, but weak - too much like a B movie plot: Among other weaknesses, it was clear that the author didn't know San Francisco very well. That should have been a warning! Too many cliches, not enough depth at all- this could have been a rich disturbing story, instead it was one dimensional and rather juvenile. Dissapointing"
positive,"AMAZING HISTORY, MUSIC AND PERFORMANCES: I loved this film. its amazing to find out what an important role blues music and later rock and roll had in the dissolving of segregation. It becomes so clear from this film that we have come such a long way in 50 years. The amazing musicians, Muddy Waters (brilliantly portrayed by Jeffrey Wright), Howlin' Wolf, another brilliant performance, of course Etta James played by Beyonce and Chuck Berry played by Mos Def all had their beautiful voices heard through music. i think if you care about music and American History you should not miss this film!!!"
negative,"Advocates game playing & manipulation: I wanted to like this book. Many women, including myself, could benefit from having more of a backbone when it comes to romantic relationships. In that sense, this book is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, the book's message is muddied by its endorsement of game playing and manipulation. The author tells you many times she's not telling you to play games but the reality is that's what her advice boils down to. So . . take away the importance of being strong and being yourself. But unless you want inauthentic relationships based on manipulation and games, save your money."
positive,Very Pleased!: I purchased the fifth season of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air for my niece for Christmas and she was so happy. The order came in just in time for Christmas!Very Pleased with Amazon's service!Emma-Marz
negative,"JW Pet Company Ruffians Turtle Dog Toy, Small (Colors Vary): JW Pet Company Ruffians Turtle Dog Toy, Small (Colors Vary) , ordered accidentally, thought it was bigger, my 2 labs would swallow this like candy, gave to a friend who has a boxer, too cheap to return for credit/exchange"
negative,WHAT HAPPEN?: I love shadow hearts 1-2. God they were amazing. I played part 3. While i was playing it. The grpahics went to Hell. It was a down grade from ther others. The voice was amazing. The battle system was awesome. the story was just not there. the game drags on and on. It was badly written and design. I love 1-2. I still play them on My PS3. I beat this game 2 times to see 2 endings. The second time. I had to force myself to play this. I just dont know why they did a crappy job on this. Just bad.this was bad on every level.Shadow Hearts 1-2 was golden. Part 3 was Bronze. this opinion is mine not others.
negative,"Complete reference... yes: Well although i found the book to be extremely informative and I learned a great deal from it, I was very disapointed that I could not get a lot of the examples to work for me. I am not talking about the images but the actual pages did not come up the way the way the book depicts them if you type them in exactly the way it is printed. I had to tweek them a bit to make them work correctly. I fell that I am going to have to go elsewhere to find the right type of book for me. Other than that the book did have a lot of information to give and will keep it as a reference as the book's title plainly details."
negative,"lost settings: Works great most of the time. BUT, keeps losing settings thus my internet drops. I have to reinstall drivers every couple of days."
negative,"Too expensive: These blades shave me well, but only last me 6 shaves at the most.After one year's use, this would cost me about $180.I have therefore bought a high end electric shaver for the same price.I only shave with these for special occasions.Easy!"
negative,Good as long as it lasts: This laptop was really nice for the first two years that I owned it - then the power stopped connecting properly. I tried to have it repaired but it just went from bad to worse (using a port replicator as a power source didn't work at all either). So now I can't turn on my computer at all. HP told me they could replace the entire motherboard to fix the problem - for $1000. I don't think so!
positive,scale: i really like this scale for the money.what i dont like is it weight pointer never stops moving so it can be hard to find an exact weight
negative,"Dreamcatcher Ho-Hum: This is just one more of Stephen King's recent ramblings. It probably has a good plot, but the constant use of ""shock-words"" and vulgarities detracts from a good story. It is way too wordy and could have been written as a novelette such as ""Thinner"". All indications are that this may be my last Stephen King purchase."
positive,diapers: It's great to be able to order diapers online. Plus it is much cheaper than going to your local store. I love amazon.
negative,Not that great.: I didn't really enjoy this. thought it was a waste of time and money. Kind of dragged on too much.
positive,"Great for playdates, but a bit fragile: We are on our third crocodile dentist! It is a wonderful wonderful toy that my developmentally delayed preschooler and his typical friend all LOVE. But I carry it to the park in a large toy bag and the past two copies have broken...when you press a tooth it won't stay down anymore. A good way around this might be to keep it in a box of it's own.This is also a wonderful toy for parents following the RDI Steve Gutstein social therapy for children with Autism. Because this toy has an element of surprise, as you press each tooth you never know if this is the tooth that will cause the jaw to snap shut! Note: the snapping shut is fairly gentle and safe for preschoolers!"
negative,"A terrible story that uses mediocrity as it's paradigm: This story lacks passion, character development, and most of all, an interesting plotlines. Their is no crucial conflict, no culmination, no threat that either side may win or lose. The story lacked intensity, and made of for it with it's exceptional reality. However, reality may work for some fiction, it did not for this one. Overall, I think this story used mediocrity as it's paradigm"
positive,"Delicious book: A friend lent me this book to ready and I couldn't put it down. I am not a historian by any means, I just love to read. I found this fascinating and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. You find yourself being so drawn back in time. I highly recommend it for pure enjoyment."
positive,Always Reserves A Spot In The CD Player: i love this Cd. This is a collection of work by someone who is really talented and gifted. Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!!!
positive,"Of mice and men review: Mr. Steibeck has managed to write an exelent novel,""Of mice and men"".The novel has a very interesting layout, and it deals with some aspects that are familiar to us in every moment of our lives; lonelyness, authority, dreams, and friendship are the main ones. The book has also a very good and interesting relationship between the main characters, George and Lennie.I think that their relationship is the main plot of the story,but the shocking part is George's last action. I would recomend this book to a teenager because it teaches us how to afront our problems."
negative,"this book bored me. does that make me a bad person?: the first chapter is a model of precision. in only nine pages, a handful of characters are introduced with masterful clarity. subtle dialouge paints a portrait of each character with a depth that many novelists never achieve over the course of hundreds of pages. jane austen's supreme talent is shining bright. then what happens? it goes on and on and on. and i got severely bored. i did not care about emma's social schemes, her obssession with ones rank within society. she is simply a dull character. and the language ultimately grows tiresome. the purple prose weighed heavy on my poor brain after a hundred pages. a bit beyond page 220 i jumped ship. i simply could not finish the book. sorry."
negative,Not at all the feminist work I'd imagined: Seemed to be an experiment in stream of consciousness with a storyline. The constant thoughts of the character seem to interfere with the book. There is odd sexual situations and thoughts which I assume was very provocative at the time but now are just like amateur literotica. Not recommended.
positive,"Fascinating look into economics, still seen as legendary: This fascinating look into the world of developing and growing economies emphasises the LCD's inverted ""u"" shaped curve of Economic growth. Although written in 1954 this work is seen as the seminal study in the field of developmental economics and was the key factor in securing W. Arthur Lewis's Knighthood in 1963, and Nobel Prize for Economics in 1979."
positive,"A good lead-in, but the series gets better: (If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3.5) While I enjoyed ""Foundation"" and found some of the concepts intriguing, it seems that Asimov had a lot of maturing to do as a writer at this point. The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development. I still reccomend this book, in part because it leads into the rest of the series, which tends to improve stylistically as the books advance. However overrated ""Foundation"" may be, it firmly holds ground simply because it is so integral to the foundation trilogy and subsequent additions."
negative,"A predictable, formulaic, thriller: Psychosexual? I figured out the plot twist in the first few pages and the murderer as soon as he/she was introduced."
negative,"Not a great Kindle transfer: The illustrations are great, but the text is too small. There is no way to increase the size of the text. Get your magnifying glass out."
negative,"Meh.: I love strung out.. they keep getting better and better.. until now. I don't know what they were thinking, it's overproduced and none of the songs are even that interesting. Some are metal and some are like, radio punk or something. Save yourself the disappointment and wait for the next LP, hopefully that will be better. In the meantime if you gotta get a new EP, go pick up the one by Good Riddance."
negative,"Avoid this Edition: Book comes riddled with typos, errors, etc. Don't save yourself a few dollars by going with a cheap(er) edition."
negative,"A Bit Forced: While some of the images and quips are funny, many are too forced. There are a lot of 'dress up' dog pictures which is fine, but the little sayings underneith don't always work.I think the title of this book is very misleading. These dogs don't look 'bad' at all. Few if any are doing anything but posing for the photograph."
positive,"A lovely book: I just adored this book, it takes me to another time and place. Something I just love in a book. I had seen the movie of this book years ago and just loved it. I love this book even more. It has wonderfully drawn charecters and places. I recommend this book highly."
negative,"Won't use again: I used the white strips once, but didn't even finish the package because they're such a hassle. I found that after a while the strips simply stop adhering to my teeth and I literally can't keep them in place inside my mouth for the recommended time - they end up wadding up like plastic wrap. Since I had braces, my teeth are very straight, so I switched to Aquafresh white trays, which worked out much better for me as they are VERY easy to keep in place."
negative,"Don't Get Me Wrong, I Still Love Bowie: The fatal flaw of this video is not Bowie's performance (he is brilliant), but its inferior production quality. It appears to be a pathetically low-budget production, a pity considering that it was done by the same man, D.A. Pennebaker, who wonderfully documented Bob Dylan's 1965 British tour in ""Don't Look Back"" (1967). As it is, the sound quality of this Ziggy Stardust performance is quite poor, as if all the mics were positioned 250 yards away from the stage. Moreover, the camera work is at times annoyingly erratic and inappropriate. The whole production, strangely, reeks of amateurism. If this movie would have been made with, for example, the production quality of Led Zeppelin's ""The Song Remains the Same,"" it would be well worth watching. Unfortunately, the bizarre sight of Bowie himself in action is its only saving grace."
negative,"Baryshnikov and Hackman save the day: I watched this despite bad reviews because I really wanted to see Baryshnikov in a feature film like this. And he does a great job. I'm wondering why Hollywood never offered him more roles like this over the years, since he's really quite good at it. Despite the chemistry of the actors, the movie is just very hokey and pointless. They try to make the story interesting by alluding to the extent of corruption within the U.S. government, but I think that's all common knowledge these days and not really that shocking anymore. I was amused throughout the movie that the CIA and Russia were upset about losing 2 million dollars, because I kept thinking of scenes in Austin Powers when everyone is laughing at Dr. Evil for thinking 1 million dollars was a lot of money... In short, this movie was just kind of juvenile and nothing extraordinary. Baryshnikov fans should be pleased though."
negative,"BLASPHEMY: How could anyone think that Jennifer Love Hewitt looks or acts anything like audrey? who in thier right mind could see this gangly, ungraceful, talentless, squinty has-been as one of the most beloved actresses/humanitarians of our time? Its blasphemy and I am glad this movie tanked."
negative,"Not One of His Best: I'm a long-time Zane Grey fan and thought I'd read all his Westerns, but apparently I'd missed this one. While I agree with the other reviewers about his compelling descriptions of the West and its beauty, overall I found the story both boring and didactic. Missing were the memorable characters of many other of his books; missing also was the kind of action that makes it hard to put my Kindle down. I'm afraid that I can give it only two stars."
positive,"Blew me away: A powerful book that will send God-bumps down your spine! Even if you are not a fan of David Wilkerson's later writings, this book is truly a God send. Read this book if you want to learn of the power of the Holy Spirit in the lives of others."
positive,Very enjoyable: We enjoyed playing this DVD during Christmas Day while opening gifts and enjoying family time together. It was great to have this as background music during the day.
positive,"Amazing experience....: All of Tina and Nick's CD's are incredibe but this one is especially relaxing and perfect for escaping the rushed and hurried world we live in today.This CD will take you on a journey that will leave feeling calm, content and refreshed. Highly recommended."
negative,"Gimmie A Break!: Not that I don't like Shakespeare's works, but his tragedies are terrible, especially this one. I can't understand the language real well, so I have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it'll be easier to understand. I just can't understand this love tragedy at all! Here are some things that confuse me:*How did this feud really begin?*Why can't this story end in happily ever after?*Why does Lady Capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody?*Why couldn't Shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand?*Why does everybody have to jump to conclusions?I simply can't understand why people love this play so much. It's ridiculous! If you want a true love story, try reading ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". This one absolutely SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,Lord of the Flies: Lord of the Flies is an awesome book! To me it reflects the truth of human nature and its defects. Sadly it is quite true... It shows many psychological characters and for the most part we see at least a bit of ourselves in them.....
negative,"Really bad....: This is by far the worst movie in black cinema. Take everything you liked about ""Friday"", ""Booty Call"" and ""CB4"", leave them out of this movie and this is what you get. 90 minutes of [stuff]. It is low budget beyond low budget, and you get a headache from listing to fake, incoherent characters who look like they were picked off the street of some ghetto. And those who like to see booty-there is basically none, just one scene which lasts about 15 seconds and features a silent, unattractive ""dancer"".. If you are a fan of these movies, rent it first, you'll see. If you buy it, you will find a movie devoid of beautifull black women and good looking guys, but which is filled with stupid humor and a story which will put you to sleep."
positive,classic: Classic novel i read in middle school. Loved this book so much i traveled to England with it -_- cried when it disappeared in the airport on the way back. So happy i have a copy on my ipad iphone and itouch now!
positive,"Mostly useful as a historical reference: Fascinating look into the past. I think some people might think this book has a few good ways to go green old fashioned if you're interested or off the grid or survival stuff or whatever (Just steer clear of the medical section. Fear Factor anyone?) but I think it is mostly useful as a historical reference. A great insight to logic back then. Still it was still fun to let your imagination run wild dreaming of doing some of these things. Also if you are going to do some reading about history why not go directly to the source on that particular subject? The chapter on raiseing girls was very modern in some suprising ways, I expected a sit down and be quite chapter but thats not what I got. For the price I think it was worth it."
positive,"A must read for all even those who don't like sci-fi: I will keep this brief. This is one of the mostly richly filled stories ever written. It has great action, intrigue and moves quick. But what sets it apart from the rest is the unique outlook on human nature and the way the universe works. Although set in the future, it is a very plausable concept of where we as a species may evolve to. I read it every time I start a new job for its machiavellian intrigues and insight into human nature. I am now on my 6th copy, having worn out a couple and given a couple away. Do yourself a favor and get this one, you will be a smarter sharper more intutive individual for reading it."
negative,"Diapers ok...delivery: HORRIBLE: Diapers are Pampers, so they work as well as any diaper. Except, that I prefer Safeway brand diapers because they hold overnight and are slightly bigger than Pampers. But, the price is comparable to Amazon.com. Delivery, on the other hand was horrible! Box was totally ripped, torn and almost all the diapers were exposed. Deivery by UPS and I took a pic. Very disappointed Amazon didn't put box into another to protect the cheap box the diapers are orginiall packaged in."
negative,"Don't Waste Your Time: I read a book by Jeff Long with the same title and about the same subject. Though the book started a bit slow, it took up speed and turned into one of the best reads ever, to me. I was wondering how they would turn something so interesting and complex, and psychological into a video. They didn't. This does not, at all, represent that book. If it pretended to and I were the author, I would sue. What a travesty. Boring, schlock, Hollywood representation, turning every interesting story into the outlike of a horror movie that once sold well. Please, if you like the idea of this story, buy the book. Don't Waste Your Time."
positive,"Clockwork Orange: I received this movie way ahead of the scheduled delivery date and it was package well. I remember watching this movie as a kid, watching it again as an adult brought back many memories..... Defininetly a CLASSIC!!!"
negative,"an ok story but sort of disgusting: In this book, there is a drought in Balam's village. It tells about Balam's life in the Yucatan, and their strugle to bring the rains. Balam is eager to become a man, and he kills a jaguar, thinking that this will please the gods and bring the rains. However, it does not.This book depicted a lot of violence, blood and gore, and had a sad ending. I would not recommend it to people who don't handle blood well."
negative,Relaxing entertainment: I did not realise that this was just a book containing the 3 other professor books that I already own and have read.I would not have bought this had I been aware.
positive,"An interesting book: This was a very good novel, the author William Golding expresses the feelings of the characters very well. It makes you realize how life really is, that there is evil inside of every one. I would recommend this book to anyone who actually likes to read, I believe that people who read it will like it, like me."
positive,So entertaining: I love Robin Hood. I remember watching it with my daughter when she was young and now my grandchildren will enjoy it as well. Great condition and prompt delivery
positive,Fantastic service: I ordered this from Amazon and with regular shipping and received the product 2 days later. I bought it due to a recommendation from our pediatrician and it does work. You must use it daily and we have not been as vigilant as we should.
negative,"Horrible Wireless Adapter: This thing is a nightmare. Cuts out constantly and at random times for no apparent reason. The internet could be working just fine and then randomly, it will stop working and stop detecting any wireless networks in range... only to magically start working again a few hours or days later. It is not the range since it is only about 15 feet away from my router, so I really do not know what the problem is."
positive,"pretty good extra on oliver reed, other than that, not really worth the extra money: Your best bet is to go with the one disc special edition."
negative,"TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!: This thing doesn't work at all - right out of the box! Says to set to low temp for several minutes to begin; 10 min later, not even warm.Description should indicate only way to get steam - for a second or two - is to mash the flimsy button on top, but then wait minute or two to get more. NO constant steam.Water reservoir would not detach to fill.Piece of cheap, worthless junk!"
negative,"Good movie -- bad DVD: This thriller was always an extremely entertaining Hitchcock knockoff (nothing at all like Basic Instinct, despite the other reviews here) -- if you could buy Gere as a therapist, and that's not hard, since he's not playing a *smart* therapist -- but a lot of the charm of the movie was how gorgeous it was visually, and this DVD does not give you the gorgeous anarmorphic widescreen picture you expect from a DVD. It's formatted to fit your (square) screen. I would much rather have paid 20 bucks for the expected widescreen version -- since I already had the VHS, this wasn't even worth 10. (Yes, I admit I should have read the product description more carefully, but I didn't realize people were releasing widescreen movies on DVD without a widescreen option -- why should they, for crying out loud? -- so I got blindsided. I post this to warn others like myself.)"
negative,"Singed my hair after one use: I used it just like it said, I brushed as it dried never leaving it in one place and after one use I found a section of hair that was burned.This gets too hot and their is no way to protect the hair shaft.It is going back and I will have to trim my hair"
positive,from a doula dad: The tips for first time mom and dad are very helpful.I followed them all and our birth is a breeze.
positive,"Undiscovered classic: This is a re-release of ""How Sweet to be an Idiot"". The original was great with wonderfully melodic songs, nice boogie rock, Lennonesque ballad -- and even a sense of humor. Worth the price -- and more!"
positive,"If I could give it more stars, I would!!: I have to say that I really really enjoyed this book. As soon as I was finished I drove over to my parents house to give it to them to read!There are some many mysteries surrounding the sightings of Mary, the mother of Jesus and putting them into this book with its conspiracy plot was magic. Although it puts some aspects of the Catholic Church in a bad light (and I'm Catholic), it is a work of fiction to be enjoyed on that level! I hope to read any other books by Steve Berry as I'm sure that they will be as wonderful as this was!"
positive,"Fits true to size: This was a gift to my son who is 6'7"". It fits perfectly and is really good quality."
negative,"Talentless hack takes a whack at jazz singing...: Patti Page ""The Tennessee Waltz Gal"" should never have attemted to record a jazz vocal album, for one she lacks the individuality that it takes to be a jazz singer, number two how can anyone take seriously a singer who sings ""How Much Is That Doggie In The Window."" And three when she sings, she sounds like she doesn't care about what she's singing about, Page is definately not a lyrical singer. Even though Pete Rugalo(the talented jazz vocalist June Christy's regular arranger), who arranged this album, tried to make Miss Page sound listenable, it just didn't work out. Stay away from this CD or any CD that has the name ""patti Page"" on it."
positive,up from slavery: a good read with much information from the early america era. Booker T. Washington use the brain over violence and suceeded where others failed. excellent read.!!!!
negative,"Why can't Jean's publisher help out?: I enjoyed every one of Jean Auel's books until now. This book was all set up and NO plot. Even though some possible action was hinted at throughout the book, NOTHING happened. Hint for her next book: use Auel's detail of prehistoric life and character set-up, then hire a ghost writer to weave a PLOT into the book."
positive,"Thank you for saving my back!!!: I ordered this air mattress because I have a bad back and was getting another procedure done and needed a place to recover. We already have a Queen-size air mattress but have space limitations so this was a perfect fit in more ways than one. As always, the customer service with Amazon was wonderful and they got it to me in time, and now I sleep on this air mattress more than my real bed! It is comfortable and actually helps when my back is acting up and it is the only place that I am able to find relief. So thank you for a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone. The air stays in and it is easy to inflate and deflate. The price is also great as well. I can think of many reasons why this would be a purchase that is more than worth it for people of all ages (I am in my forties)."
negative,"Missing text: Every time there's a verb of speaking and a colon, this kindle ebook simply omits what follows. Somebody must've been in a big hurry."
negative,"My fault I guess, but this cable wouldn't work with my specific Nikon Coolpix camer.: It was my understanding that this would work with any Nikon Coolpix camera, however, it did not fit with my specific model of the camera. I was disappointed as I felt that due to the description it would work. Can't complain too much because the cost wasn't unreasonable, just didn't work as described."
positive,"Great deal for day. Needed different diapers for night.: I've always loved Pampers diapers and found these to be a great deal- especially when coupled with Amazon Mom and the subscribe and save option. However, now that my daughter is in size three, we found that we needed night-time diapers for her to wear to bed. She leaked through these quite a few times. Once we got the bedtime diapers, I loved these diapers for daytime. They're not too bulky and wear really well."
positive,"Outstanding Book: From the persective of a U.S. Army Officer, I highly recommend this book. Mr. Hoiback does an excellent job, in a very concise manner, to describe the linkage between Authority, Intent, and Dissemination of command. He then uses two case studies that show the relationships in the real world.I really appriciated the second case study showing the opening days of WWII in Norway. The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War. By reading the Second Case study first, I believe that case study one will be easier to follow.Eric"
negative,"Where's the plot?: This books takes the reader to the very edge of suspense but never produces the thrill. I kept hoping, until the very last page, to be awarded with the twist or big payoff at the end of the story. I am a huge fan and normally read a Grisham book in 2 days, this one took me 3 weeks. I forced myself to finish it because I had woven a web in my mind and wanted to see if I was right. It turned out my ending was better than the one in the book. The account of life in a small southern town during the 70's was a pleasant read but not enough to make up for the missing plot and average story."
negative,"Not a Fan: I have tried to read the ""whole"" of the book, but find that the book has too many ""holes"".For those who are interested in the Wiccan path, read Scott Cunningham as a start as he, and there are others, who explain and teach with great wisdom.I am sorry I am not s fan of hers, but I find her books more for teenagers and certainly they should not be reading Silverwolf without having read a proper authority on Wicca. Sadly, hers are the books that remind me too much of Halloween and all the kiddy behavior that sometimes follows.Please, save your money."
negative,"Pretty, but don't buy: We purchased one of these because it was pretty, and had some neat features. What we didn't realize was that pretty doesn't make good coffee. Within a few short months, the timer and automatic start went out--shortly after, the fancy swing arm broke, too. We mailed it back and waited for a new one. Sure enough, the timer on the new one pooped out after just a few weeks, and a year later the arm broke *again*. Emails to the company (nice ones!!) were not returned. When we finally got in touch with them we were told that although this is a common problem, since it had been over one year we were out of luck. This product simply costs too much to dispose of after a year, especally as our $20, 7 year old Mr. Coffee still works better than the DeLonghi. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it."
positive,"Parts read like romance novels of today: I loved all the Earth's Children books but was so disappointed to read loves scenes (over and over) in ""Stone"" that read like today's romance novels.Jean Auel goes to great lengths to give the reader a feel for life 30,000 ago. I am just somewhat disappointed with the graphic love details."
positive,"This is one of the best books I've ever read!: ""Wren"" is one of my favourite books. My other favourites are ""Karen"" and ""With Love From Karen."" I think Marie Killilea is one of the best authors ever!"
negative,"Trying not to claw my eyes out: How people could get through the first two paragraphs is beyond me. If I want to read badly written prose that badly, I'll go online and search for amateur writers' forums. To be frank, most of those are better than this.""...and the book shows the influence of Tolkien, of course, but also Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey, and perhaps even Wagner in its traditional quest structure and the generally agreed-upon nature of dwarves, elves, dragons, and heroic warfare with magic swords.""The point of CREATIVE writing is to do something that hasn't already been done by EVERY OTHER fantasy writer out there. At least, that's how it always struck me. Tolkien, Brooks, and McCaffrey have influenced a load of people, most likely each other as well, and that's exactly what makes this piece utterly uncreative. Even the NAMES are uncreative, for heaven's sake.No, this is not worth $$$. Save your hard-earned money for something useful. Like coffee."
negative,"Bad: Nose earring was too small to put in my nose, and as i was trying to put it in, the little rhinestone came out of the earring. I need to return."
positive,"Using this Multi-vitamin for years, nothing like it!: I take this multi-vitamin because I don't have to think about supplying more of any of the suplements in it. If anyone add calcium and vitamin C (Ester_C I recommend) they would be greatly protected. Obviously there are other things everyone individually need if they have other conditions or are over 40 or 45 years old when ourbodies need more daily suplements. When I stop taking this, I feel heavy and don't want to get up, once I take it, the very next mornig I feel like a feather. Try it! Once a day too...in tablets."
negative,"A flawed perspective: I think the author has a flawed perspective with cats. While some of the entries in this collection were slightly amusing, most portray kitties as vain, decadant and self absorbed, with few redeeming qualities. This was not the fun read I had hoped it would be."
negative,"Where's the beef?: This is quite an enjoyable book, but it never gets into top gear. The pages turn over quite quickly, but neither the plot nor the characters are convincing or particularly interesting. There are too many characters and most of these are rendered purely for comic effect. The shabby villains are very reminiscent of the losers who perform similar functions in Graham Greene's early thrillers. They may work as amusing caricatures and one might argue that the book's collection of failed flamenco singers and useless ex-bullfighters is ironic - a mockery of other countries perceptions of Spain, but the book needs more than irony, jokes, lustful priests and glamorous aristocrats. Neither the Vatican nor the computer angles are rendered with much conviction and there are many long passages that add nothing to the slim plot or our understanding of the characters."
positive,"Wonderful! Fantastique!: I was hesitant, at first, but being a great fan of Catherine Deneuve and Fanny Ardant, how could I not see this film?!? Once I decided to rent ""8 Femmes"" I was not disappointed. In fact, I was most pleasantly surprised - the music, too, is a nice bonus. Isabelle Huppert gives a scene-stealing performance, and there is nothing bad to say about this film. See it, and enjoy!"
positive,"An Excellent Book that I Use For My Catechism Class!!!: The late Frank Sheed (a Roman Catholic from Australia) wrote this book in the 1940s during the pontificate of Pope Pius XII. It was later republished by Ignatius Press and remains one of the most essential and unforgetable Catholic books in America.He talks greatly about free will, the creation of Man, the test of Angels and Men, the difference between free will and predestination (the Protestant Calvinist notion), the Sacrifice of the Mass, and more importantly---WHO IS GOD?I love it because it is a great in depth book of understanding Catholic Theology. The Scripture quotations are from the Douay Rheims Bible and the Revised Standard Version: Catholic Edition.I recommend this book for all Catholics and non-Catholics as well. It was one of the best textbooks I used for catechism class in my parish church."
negative,"Book* b = this->book; delete b;: I am a scientist and an experienced software developer. This book kind of skims the surface of four basic neural network architectures, and provides a plethora of horribly written source code as a sort of ""tool kit"" for ANN development. After reading the book and trying to make use of the source (which I basically threw out and wrote my own, truly object-oriented tool kit), it's not clear just how much the author really knows about ANNs and OO programming (e.g., Lots of necessary details are sometimes skipped or glossed over; I've never seen so much non-template implementation in header files before: this is not the way to write OO code). I became so disgusted with this book that I decided to write this review. I would not recommend this book to anyone who wishes to delve into ANNs."
positive,Strong set of balldrivers!: I use these balldrivers everyday and love them.Nice finish and very strong at the ball end.Handy tool at a good price.
negative,What was Oprah thinking: What was Oprah thinking recommending this. The story is just as depressing as the picture of the author on the cover. I did not enjoy this at all.
positive,"Not for the weak...: I saw this when I was at a college reunion and it was graphic then, now even more so. It is a tale of rightful revenge and basic human instincts. The right of a person to be free to do what is fair and honest and the right to defend when those rights are violated. A woman writer is in the backwoods for solitude and writing. Her peace is shattered by four overly base and vile males hicks who decide she is a plaything. The graphic rape scenes and sodomy makes you want to kill every male around you. She survives and plots her revenge in four unique ways which are worthy of emulation in our court rooms. I won't ruin the climax scene for the final revenge, but the film is worthy of a look, even if for it's lessons learned...that's my take anyway...Q"
negative,"Good Singer --- Bad Album: Aiken initially surprised me with his voice on the American Idol show. I listened to Ruben Studdard's ""Soulful"" Album as well as Aiken's effort. After listening to both, I purchased Ruben's Album and was extremely satisfied. While both artists have great voices, Aiken's album was full of boring tunes suited for Hotel elevators. I wouldn't recommend this album. Hopefully, his next CD will consist of stronger material."
positive,"Way To Go Mark!!: True To Form is a great CD. Mark LaForme did a great job on this one. I just want to say that there is no need for this country musician to compete with today's new style country. He did indeed stay ""True To Form"". Great job Mr. LaForme!! I can't wait for your next album."
positive,Pink Princess Poodle: I purchased the Pink Princess Poodle for my niece as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loves it. STUFF IT.. DECORATE IT.. LOVE IT..!!
negative,"DO WHAT?: Okay, first they cut the hell out of the show when the put in on VHS and now they are cutting it even more on DVD. Where is Many Rivers To Cross, Tougher Than The Rest, Hold On, Take It To The Limit? I pray the tracklisting is an error and we will get the full concert on DVD."
negative,"Yawn: This movie is boring, there is no script to it. It's like the makers went out on the streets, and asked a bunch of kids to act like idiots while he tapes them."
negative,"Slow and pointless: Great idea--strange reactions to art--is tossed aside and scene after scene is set up yet goes nowhere. (Why does she return home? Why does she have to be a cop? She never shows up at the station!) Poorly edited with transitions so bad, title cards were added so you know where you are -- Rome, etc. Interesting conclusion, yet really, it's a mess so skip it."
negative,Not water resistant -- one spill ruined the look: 1. The 6 and 9 pieces are interchangeable...that led to some confusion.2. I want this same puzzle with no glossy paper glued on. The remains of a drink were spilled onto it and the paper is now peeling off and it also absorbed the stainThe whole reason I buy wooden toys is for durability -- this same toy with just a stained/painted/plain wood would be perfect
negative,"Uhh..... Were they stoned?: This was the biggest piece of drunken hoopla in the WORLD! I can't believe people would actually take time out of their daily schedule to watch this! If you actually read The Odyssey, the movie is NOTHING like the real thing. I STRONGLY suggest that you read the book first. Well, anyways, no one is going to read this review thus rendering this review useless and something to clutter the internet even more than it already is. I AM THE ANTICRHIST!"
positive,"Night of the living dead: Super classic, a must own for zombie fans. However when I was little I didn't recall wanting to punch the blonde chick in the face that screams way to much and way to loud in this movie."
positive,"April Morning: I have just finished the book ""april Morning"" by, Howard Fast.It is an excellent book.The book is about is about a young man who joins the army during the Revolutionary war. the begining was a little tedious but after that the book was great. ""april Morning"" goes into detail a lot especially when there is a battle. There are alot of charecters and it is some times hard to remember them all. there is a lot dialogue in the book. If you like historical fiction or action I recommend this book."
positive,noble house: excellent read.follows the pattern set forth by the author's prevous works in the asian theme. where may I find the Whirlwind book?
negative,"ADDONICS PORTABLE CD DRIVE - I am disappointed in its performance: I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon."
positive,"Never a wet day.: Pampers is by far the best type on diapers. The only one I'd ever buy. I have been supplying my grandson with diapers from birth, and he's never had any leaks or discomfort. I am really always happy to do my purchases from Amazon versus baby.com (1800diapers.com) as they charge a fee for shipping. Amazon is free. I will continue to purchase for my grandson and other family members who want to have a large stock at all times. I really like the bulk packaging."
negative,"boring: This toy is very durable with brigh colors, but this toy is also quite lame!!! There is nothing to do besides popping the animals on and of of the other plastic pieces. We received this toy as a gift, and the only thing it has proved itself good for, is a teether (the different pieces) to our daughter."
positive,A Star Is Born: The first time I saw this movie was on the late show. I sobbed for a long time after I seen it. It is one of my favorite movies I have ever seen. Every once in awhile I will watch it. It still makes me cry every time.
negative,"Mediocre Material for a Stellar Singer: What should we do with Clay Aiken's amazing vocal abilities and unique style? Apparently, tone him down, give him barely passable bubble gum pop ballads (with laughable lyrics), and do everything the studio can to make him sound as generic as possible. Clay, find new handlers!"
positive,NON-STOP ACTION...What's NOT to like about this movie?: I'm not sure why this movie didn't do well. It has it's faults but so do many movies that others praise. My biggest complaint about this movie is it has several editing problems. Overall...It is a very entertaining action movie with a fantastic story line.
negative,"I must be an alien: I and my friends have never got this type of writing. Maybe we are aliens, or maybe you have to be from New York or something. It alls seems very unconvincing from a human perspective. No one we know acts or feels this way. It's like a Hollywood movie script where there are no parameters in reality. Surely humor is funny because it is based on actual human experience. Sedaris seems like he made the whole thing up. No one could have a family with this much dysfunction. I don't understand the adulation and even Carnegie Hall readings. As I say, maybe it's a New York thing."
positive,"Enjoyable tent for little ones: This particular tunnel is used at my local library during children's story/play time. All of the children rush to play in it which is why I purchased this one for my child. If your child is younger, a brighter color might be more inviting than the dark blue one but overall, they are sturdy and easy to use. It shipped quickly and matches the product description/photo online."
negative,"A $... Disappointment: As a fan of Stephen King for over 20 years, I bought this bookwith high expectations but have been heartily disappointed by it. Across between ""The Tommyknockers"" and ""Invasion of theBodysnatchers,"" ""Dreamcatcher"" chronicles the tiredworld of ET's attempting to take over the world. Two-dimensionalcharacters do not help the story. I knew and cared about every singlecharacter in ""The Stand"" but I kept getting the relativelyfew characters in ""Dreamcatcher"" mixed up. Stephen King'sfascination with secret government operations is also gettingold.This book reads like a first draft and lacks the carefulcharacterizations and brilliant plots of books like ""TheTalisman,"" ""The Shining"", and so many of King's earlyworks. I do not recommend this book."
negative,"Old information: Unfortunately, I did not like this book. I found it difficult to read and boring, even though it was recommended by a friend.."
negative,"A waste of a good plot: I thought that this movie was going to be scary, and terrifying. In the end, it was stupid and meaningless. The plot was good, but it was played out all wrong. It was a waste of a good 2 and a half hours and it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
negative,"no, that's not this book: WARNING! the editorial reviews and reader reviews on this page have nothing to do with this book! puglisi's text is a hefty phaidon paperback; the book you buy here is a slim rizzoli hardback. the quadrifolio is actually a set of folded up posters glued into a hard binding. there is a meager introduction, no critical apparatus, no captioning or text describing the paintings, no page numbering, no table of contents, no index. the reproductions themselves are not optimally color balanced, veering sometimes toward green, sometimes toward red. fine if you want it, but don't expect puglisi's magnificent volume."
positive,"This item is great: We ordered 2 of these for our 2 series 2 tivo's and so far, we have not had one hitch in the system. These are super easy to install, they pick up the network quickly and they have worked well so far.i recommend spending the extra money to buy the Tivo brand. it's more money, but less hassel and more satisfaction."
positive,"Nutty flavor: Thanks to nutritionist Kimberly Snyder's book The Beauty Detox Solution, I changed the way I eat. In her book, she recommends substituting cheese for Yeast Flakes. Expecting a cheesy flavor, I was surprised that this is more of a nutty flavor. I read all of the reviews so I knew the expect this. I love putting this on my salad and have no complaints that it doesn't exactly taste like cheese. I will add it to my popcorn next time just to see how the flavor will taste then but for now, I'm 100% satisfied with the quality and taste of these yeast flakes."
negative,Has NO value!: If your studying herbs or medicinal plants this book should NOT be on your list of books to own. IT IS WORTHLESS! It is a Pagan Religion Book. Plain and simple! In my opinion it is for the study of WITCHCRAFT and the like.
positive,"Perfect gift for the avid hunter: At last, a present for the most difficult-to-buy-for man. Seminal work of game hunters. Gun sport against a historical backdrop."
negative,"disappointing read: Yes it is truly amazing what the man accomplished andI cannot take anything away from his feat.His book, on the other hand, I was sorry that I bought.After the first 3 chapters I gave up. Barely making itout of the desert. Maybe I'll pick it up at a later datebut I just got tired of ""Day 1: I ran"", ""Day 2: I ran"",""Day 3:I ran, it rained""... yawn.I need a book to convince my wife to hike for more than10 days at a stretch and this fell far short.Not recommended"
positive,"Cornell hasn't lost it: Soundgarden was Chris Cornell. Not that the other bandmates didn't contribute, but anyone who listened to Temple of the Dog and looked at the liner notes understood that Cornell contributed more than a voice. He was an arranger and a brilliant lyricist.He extends that further with Euphoria Morning. He still has the musical sensibilities that made Soundgarden a household name in the 90s. Looking forward to more of his musical offerings."
negative,Beautiful bag but terrible material!: I absolutely loved the appearance of the bag. The colors are beautiful and the bag has a lot of compartments but it unfortunately has two huge problems:1. the main compartment opens on one side which makes it hard to open and close and calls for tugging at the zipper2. the material along the zipper to the main compartment tears too easilyI have had this diaper bag for no more than a month and the bag is already completely torn at the zipper. The great thing is that JJ Cole has great customer service. But I don't buy items to return them so this is an inconvenience.
positive,"Great Stand - Barely Fits My Jamis MTB: This stand is SOOO convenient. I mostly use it for propping my bike up in my apartment so I don't have to lean it on my furniture. It's wonderful for doing quick maintenance jobs, especially if you live in a small place and don't feel flipping your bike upside down or setting it up on a big rack.I give it four stars only because it barely fits my Jamis Durango 2.0 mountain bike. My bottom tube is tapered and goes to about 45 mm wide, which is wider than the hook on the stand. The hook still goes partially over the tube, though, and the stand still works fine. I'm glad it barely fits.Added comment 6/22/10 -- Because the hook barely fits, it rubs a lot every time I used it, and the rubber coating is starting to come off after about a year's worth of use. The coating would probably last longer with a bike that had a narrower bottom tube."
positive,so much better than I expected!: I didn't expect this book to be so well written and clever! This and The Boleyn Inheritance are the two most enjoyable historical fiction novels I've ever read.
positive,"Outstanding in and out of water: My wife was skeptical about purchasing a new toy. Until now, she had not cared for any toy we have used. We ended up buying the Jack Rabbit because so many of our friends recommended it. We chose to try it first in the jacuzzi...it only took about 90 seconds. The next morning, we tried it in bed with the same results. My wife is now a huge fan of the bunny ears! I highly recommend this item. But it now!!!"
positive,"Don't miss Lola !: This is a whole new experience in film. It's brilliant, innovative, and so much fun ! Fast paced, with a great pulsating score, it plays with time and shows you how a few seconds can change your life..the editing is a marvel, as well as the cinematography. (Love the ambulance/glass shot !). This incredible movie will still interest you after many viewings. It's a keeper !"
negative,I don't get it: I really don't understand all of the publicity with lauryn hill. I bought her cd last year and loved the usual songs played on the radio but now it is one of the cds sitting on the lower level of my cd rack. SOme songs were real boring.
negative,Waste of money: Horrible toy for a my 4 year old son who is a batman fanatic... flimsy and not durable. Can not get the elevator to work properly always jams up. This toy won't last to long.
positive,"One Of The Best This Year !: After I watched this film I was ready to watch it again. This is a fantastic movie; if you love a great action packed film with a beautiful scenery and a wonderful story of courage, friendship and love. You will enjoy this film. With a love of history in it's truest form. Don't listen to the critics they never know what they are talking about I somtimes wonder if they even watch the films they talk about. Watch this film you will enjoy every sec. of it."
positive,"Gorgeous singing of gorgeous music: I bought this CD on a whim. I knew nothing of either of the performers or the composer, but I am a fan of Danish song so I thought I'd give it a try.The songs are wonderful (the first two songs on the disc are among my favorites) and the singing/playing is top notch. Inger Dam-Jensen is an established singer of both art song and opera. Her work on this CD truly extraordinary, not only technically but in terms of interpretation as well. Mr. Teglbjaerg (pronounced Tile-byehr) does a fine job at the piano.Composer Peter Heise lived during the time of Schumann and Brahms, and though he isn't as famous as either of them, his songwriting ability counts him among the best. Highly recommended."
negative,"Not the best in the series: Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one."
positive,Cute shoe but!!!: Really cute sexy shoe but they do run small and they are very high as well but it said they were stilettos. I love them and I also look the red color.
negative,"Truly miseducated: I hope this artist gets beyond simple expression and learns to create music.We shouldn't suffer for her ""art."""
negative,"PHONEY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MOVIE: Nerd Score Sleazy would like everybody to think he actually grew up tough in NYC----though this allegedly autobiographical junk was written by somebody else AND rips off scenes from lots of other movies.Keitel with his hand over the fire was ripped off from ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" for one thing.And, Deniro is annoying----a lot of Deniro performances in 70s movies are annoying, which is why he only really became known to a mass audience with his later comedies.Deniro getting shot at the end is the best part---cause Deniro and his character are so annoying he deserved getting shot in the movie.This movie was a big influence on Hong Kong action movies, and Hong Kong action movies aren't exactly known for their realism."
negative,"Unbelievable: It is truly unbelievable that someone who is supposed to be a Bible prophecy expert is teaching that Babylon will be rebuilt to become a global economic power. Mystery Babylon the Great is not literal Babylon, which is why it is called a mystery. NOT LITERAL. Wake up people! You are blind and following blind guides."
positive,"New York's Greatest Portrayal: Tom Wolfe has a magical touch for breathing life into non-fiction, as in The Right Stuff, but in Bonfire of the Vanities, his skill as a novelist and a satirist is blatantly evident. This bleak and witty portrayal of New York life in the eighties is both hilarious and dark at the same time. Wolfe's characters represent the spectrum of human behavior, while his situations are riddled with ironies and paradoxes of truth about human existence. This book is most enjoyable, I would imagine, if you have at least some knowlege of New York, because much of its humor and depth stems from New York culture, but it is also true that New york is a micrchosm of american existence on a whole, so Bonfire of the Vanities may, in fact, be a universally American Novel. Whichever, it is worth reading if not only for the reason that it is funny, brilliantly written, and makes clear the fact that Tom Wolf's name belongs on the list of satirists that includes Jonathon Swift and Oscar Wilde."
positive,"Epic novel, great read.: This e-book on the Kindle Paperwhite quite simply takes me back to my times as a child reading this book, and the medium (back-lit e-ink screen) is absolutely wonderful for reading anywhere at any time. I would recommend this book and the Kindle Paperwhite. Great items, great bargain."
positive,Just like I remembered: I bought this movie for my little boy because it was something that I used to love as a child. Robinhood was just as I remembered: lots of cute characters and great songs. My son loves it just as much as I did at his age.
negative,"Worked for few days :(: Based on the reviews, I bought the sharpner. I wanted to buy Panasonic but they are not available anymore, it seems. I was refunded in full by Amazon. But, it is always a pain to re-package the item, go to the post office etc., The pencil kept on circling inside the sharpner without getting sharpened."
negative,"Hated it!: I received the previous model (peaceful aquarium) of this product for my son that is now 3 years old. He still uses it every night to fall asleep. It is such a great item that I bought it for several friends when they had children and added it to the top of my all time favorite baby items list. Now that fisher price has stopped making this item and started selling this new model, I am completely disappointed. I have a 3 month old baby girl who was given this one as a gift. I would return it in a heartbeat if I didn't think my friend would be offended. It is loud, obnoxious and not soothing at all. I can not say enough bad things about it. Fisher Price made a huge mistake when they made this model. It has mechanical sounding music that makes my child cry when I play it. It is AWFUL!!!! I too would pay dearly to have another of the previous model."
positive,"excellent value: This gun case holds a lot more then 4 guns. I put 6 guns 2 speed loaders, bb's pellets, and co2 cartridges in it and it held it secure. This is a pistal case not a travel case. My guns did not move one bit when I did transfer it from one place to another. The lock part, not so good but if your like me I don't leave my guns unintended, If they want you guns , they will take case and all. This is a good case for the price, I bought 2 of them they protect your guns and keeps them dry."
positive,Shelters of stone: Great book. Awaiting the final in the series. been a fan of the series for many years.
positive,"Nietzsche's Corps/e: I used to think that Nietzsche was a dangerous thinker. Geoff Waite, by cutting straight to the core of Nietzsche's intentions (with no 'messing around' involved), blows the whole thing apart with a nuclear bomb.There really is nothing more to say... this book is terrible (in an awesome way).I haven't seen or looked at the world in the same way ever sinse I read it.I'd love to see what would happen in the world if this book was more widely appreciated.However, there is one thing that I do know: the struggle continues.Nietzsche isn't dead? - He needs to die!"
negative,"More like a NEGATIVE 3: This comes close to being the worse piece of garbage it has ever been my privilege to view. The acting...HORRENDOUS!!! CGI...poorly done. Do yourself a favor and watch the Roman version of the Odyssey...Ulysses with Kirk Douglas. It may be an oldie, but it's definitely an absolute goodie!!"
negative,"A complete waste of a good voice ...............: I don't know quite what to make of this album, or how to determine what part of it is her, what part is people she has known, and what part is people she has seen at a distance. But one thing is certain, it is all filtered through a suppressed anger which transforms the stories in these songs into dirges with very little color or light.Her vocal method of delivery here is a closed-throat, closed-mouth drone that is unnecessary. She has a good voice but won't let it shine because she doesn't trust her lyrics alone to reach the listener and leave their mark. She is the real loser in Bittertown because she hasn't accepted and moved on."
positive,"Death at a funeral: This is a riotous, outrageous British comedy. It does take an open mind. We gave a copy to a sick friend and he enjoys it every time he needs a lift. Prepare to laugh."
positive,"A RIP-ROARING ADVENTURE!: I am only about 2/3 through this book, but just have to say it is the most rip-roaring adventure book I have ever read! It is full of information about the early 1800s, the whaling industry, the sea, and about whales that I have never known. It is all fascinating! Although I am a girl (ahem!), I am loving every word of this book, as I also loved THE ENDURANCE and INTO THIN AIR and A FIRST RATE TRAGEDY recently, not to mention TARZAN, FRANKENSTEIN, etc. from years back. This book is highly recommended whether you fancy yourself an adventurer (armchair adventurers okay) or not."
positive,"Great product!: Easy to use, fast, good size -both for small amounts as well as a meal for 6-8 people, retractable power cord."
positive,toni estes HOT HOT HOT!: THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE YEAR.ITS IN THE SAME MOULD AS DESTINYS CHILD BUT THERE ARE MORE UPTEMPO TRACKS.IF I HAD TO PICK MY FAVOURITE SONG IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HOT.BUY THIS ALBUM YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED.
negative,"Another Dumb Blonde: She sings that he never loved her and she never loved him, so what is her complaint? Both were leading the other on. She dances like a stiff giraffe, and the camera keeps changing angles to hide the fact. Like the others said, she doesn't have the vocal range like the other teeny boppers out there. A single with one song only? c'mon, give us a taste of what else you have to offer, because if you don't you'll end up like so many other one hit wonders out there."
positive,"Zombie fiction at its finest: First of, if your looking for cheap ""blood and gore"" zombie thrills, don't even finish reading this review. However, if you're looking for a griping story that focuses on the human condition in the aftermath of a global catastrophe, you've to the right place. David Moody is rising star in this genre, and if you read this book, you'll see why. The accurate portrayals of ordinariy people in this crisis is shockingly real. While the British spelling of some words may throw a few readers off, this book is fresh take on a worn out genre.Spread the infection."
negative,"Don't waste your time: I thought it would be nice to read the book before going to see the movie. However, after reading the book, I do not want to see the movie at all. There are a lot of cheap thrills in the book...the play on bodily functions, while funny, is dull after awhile. Duddit's cancer and Down's Syndrome seem somewhat overly dramatic, like the book is trying too hard. Plus, by page 200, I cannot help but feel stupid for reading the book. Nothing in the book is fresh or imaginative. The emotions that are supposed to be stirred up are unconvincing and uninspiring. Although the plot is interesting enough for me to want to find out what happens at the end, I feel like I wasted a lot of time reading all 600+ pages of it when I finished it. If you are a Stephen King fan, this may satisfy you. However, if you are not a fan, don't bother."
negative,"Do not attempt if you go on vacation: Something you won't read on any website selling these mushroom patches is the sensitivity to their exact environment. There are several crucial stages that require you to keep on eye on the mushroom patch which don't mesh well with leaving for vacation. It's a neat product, but don't plan on having mushrooms on your first attempt."
negative,Confusing and Depresing: I had to read this book for a test I am having in Honors English tomorrow. The book made no sense and was all out depressing. I don't know why anybody would want to read it let alone deem it as a classic.
positive,"nice: And I am not the biggest hip hop fan, ok? But Lauryn has a beautiful voice, and it came out fabulously on this album."
positive,"Worth a second read: I read this book and watched the movie in school nearly 15 years ago now and must admit it didn't really stick in my mind so much, sure, I knew what happened to a degree but the details weren't clear in my mind. Reading it now as an adult this will no longer be the case, it will stay with me forever. There were two parts in particular, two of the main events, that as I was reading I literally felt sick to my stomach and had tears in my eyes. This book is really quite disturbing and I realise now that really it was a big ask to get a bunch of 15-year-olds to read and watch this and perhaps if my memory was better I could tell you why it didn't affect me like it has today but alas I cannot but I must say I also wonder why not, maybe it was just too disturbing and I blocked it, who knows? Wow, even thinking about it now I think I may just have nightmares tonight."
negative,"This may be a shortened version of ""Howlin' Wolf Live Gold"": This CD looks to be a 9 track version of the Howlin' Wolf Live Gold CD (Fine Tune 2212-2) which has 14 tracks and appears to be available through Amazon Marketplace (the first nine tracks are in identical order on both CD's). From listening to the samples on Amazon the sound quality of the 9 track CD appears to be the same since as the Fine Tune version. The Fine Tune audio quality is not all that good, may not really be live, but it is the Wolf, after all. Thought fair warning was in order."
negative,I would rather have colon cancer then see this again!!: This movie is the worst comedy(if not worst movie of the decade)of 1998. To the reviewers who say it is the best movie ever they must be under the influence of some substance or homosexual like the two actors who tried to pull in more money off their Southpark fame. Theatres that showed this movie should shut down and anyone bored enough to see it 8 times should seriously consider suicide.
negative,Old VHS unreliable: This was a very interesting movie about a British woman helping the Allies in occupied France during WWII. Fascinating story - unfortunately the tape kept pausing in our VCR and we missed quite a bit of the dialogue toward the end. I think the tape had been on the shelf too long. What a shame!
negative,"It will put you to sleep!: This book talks of slavery in a positive light. Two thirds of the book is telling about the school he opened, briefly mentioning his personal or home life."
positive,"2.5 minute waffles!: It works perfectly. It was a little smaller than I had hoped, but the other features make up for that. The temperature control actually does what it says (unlike so many other waffle makers!), and the 2.5 minutes is as fast as you can ask for. It didn't hurt my feelings that you can store it upright to save cupboard space either."
positive,"Packed with suspense to the fullest!!!: A 10 if you like stories about war. A real page turner. As the story unfolds it stays at a pretty high suspense level, so it might be a little taxing on one's nerves to read it. Some statements about Germany are false for the 1980-s, they are more from the 70-s or even earlier, but that argument is more for nitpickers than anyone else.What struck me odd was the complete absence of any references towards insubordination and desertion of forces on both sides. OK, you can't desert on a ship, but on the ground it's another matter.The 'White Knight' part was a little out of place, though it counterweighted the hardware stuff nicely.Just replace any references to the F-19 with the F-117. I remember the plastic models of the F-19 sold at hobby stores 'till the early 90-s, and the F-117 to appear only shortly after Desert Shield.All in all it's a pretty good book, though by far not high literature. It's pretty long, too."
negative,"3 and 4 stars....are you kidding??: If knowing the A+ and Network+ material is 20% of the way for this exam, than this poorly written book with get you another 5%. Who are these ""Top 10 Reviewer"" guys?? And why are they trying to bump up the ratings for this book. The book needs more than a few edits, it needs a new author. Maybe Sybex should pay more attention to reader reviews. I wasted money on this book and it is no where near 4 stars."
positive,"What the BLEEP?!!!: My first exposure to Nikki was on the album ""Tom's Diner"" which has variations on the originial, and I was excited to hear the unedited version of Nikki's version. BUTTTTTTTT, some A-hole has decided to ""bless"" this version with edits galore...including an annoying ""BLEEP"" at one point in the song! If you don't want to hear it...don't listen to it, or buy it for your ""lily-white"" children in the first place! Does anyone know if an unedited version exists and, if so, where can I get it? Great song though...I guess that I'll keep searching...maybe on vinyl!"
positive,"Kids love it!: Sanding and painting and putting wheels on. Especially good for the mechanically inclined (we have a girl and a boy that both are makers and tinkerers. The quality was good. I'd hoped they were a bit larger, but they are ok as is."
positive,"More than just hair: The author is smart. If you name a book, ""Nappily Ever After"" you're gonna trick hair conscious women (which is practically every woman) into reading your novel. But is it really about hair?The basis is about hair but the message the author is trying to convey is about finding who you are and being comfortable with that. The author is a very good writer and storyteller. She took a very basic idea and made it into a very entertaining story with a lesson. A lot of people can't do that very well. It's just a simple lesson that most women can relate too. Nothing deep or philosophical (we have Octavia Butler for that) but a lesson about being comfortable with who you are.I give it 4 stars: It's a nice story.... good airplane read, poolside read, whatever. I just don't care for the characters that much. Kandi and Clint are really mean."
positive,"An enjoyable and entertaining read: Yes, there might be some that will claim it is similar to Lord of the Rings and other fantasy books, but it is still very enjoyable and a fun read. Besides, there are very few completely original books out there. They say it is for young adults, but I believe it is for anyone that likes fantasy. For someone of his age to write so well makes me look forward to future books.I thought the author developed his characters well and made them interesting. The setting and scenes were also well written.Sit back, relax (don't judge), and enjoy the book. I DID!"
positive,"4 stars for being a pioneer of the genre....: But maybe 2 for the film itself. I'm sorry, but having seen it when it first came out, about 10 years later, and again just a few days ago, while it most definitely has its moments and is important as history, the orignal TCM promises much, but actually delivers very little. Most of it is suggestion rather than graphic. It's the concept that's frightening, not the movie itself."
positive,"A book for kids and adults alike: Books don't come much better than this. Elizabeth George Speare does a great job of making history come alive, and Kit Tyler is a fascinating heroine- imperfect yet trying to keep her spirits alive in a strange, unpleasant, and foreign world. Young teenagers may not grasp the complexities of Kit Tyler and her newfound family, but anyone who has felt like they don't fit in will appreciate this great book."
positive,"GOOD COMEBACK ALBUM SINCE HIS LAST IN 1998 !: THIS ALBUM HAS ONE OF THE BEST SINGLES OUT THERE TODAY.I GIVE R.KELLY ALOT OF CREDIT IN THIS ALBUM ""ALOT OF CREDIT."" BUY THIS ALBUM NOW.YOU WON'T REGRET IT."
positive,"It's just out of the world(amazing graphics&animation): It's a must see movie,which no animation lover could afford to miss.The way the movie is shot and all the characters portraired in this movie are just wonderful.Even though it is an odd(different) topic or concept all together, this movie has all the power to fantisize you and pull you towartds seeing it again and again.On the whole it is an excellent movie which will leave you spell bouind and speechless."
positive,"Amazing: The books are simply amazing.... ive never been a book lover; however, after seeing a movie i ordered books and I'm just amazed, how u can sink into it, forgetting about world around you. Movie is really bad in comparison to the book. I read first book Eragon on a first day I recived it.... yes i've been reading for whole day, and that is because i simply couldn't walk away from it. It made me laugh and cry...truly amazing book, especially if you are interested in dragons......and it was written by 15 year old! amazing"
negative,PREDICTABLE: I found this story predictable and very slow paced. The twist is obvious enough that waiting for the characters to catch on is just a little torturous. I only finished it because I hoped I was wrong.
negative,"It has 5 blades. Who cares?: They are constantly looking for new ways to increase the cost of shaving. All they can do is add more blades. From one to two to three to four to five blades. What is next? I would imagine a 6 or 7 blade shaver. Then 10 or 12. It is utterly absurd. Save your money. You can get a nice close shave using a one blade, cheap disposable shaver. Just take your time and be careful. You'll save hundreds of dollars, though."
negative,"not family entertainment: I am a conservative. Our WHOLE family had seen a local production of the show and enjoyed it. I thought with such an all star cast we would enjoy it even more. Wrong. I object to the costumes, the women are wearing pasties. I have rewound the video three times to make sure this is what I saw. And sadly it is. The local production did not have such costumes. My children are ages 6 and 10. If I wanted them to see this kind of production we could go to Las Vegas. Donny Osmond you should be ashamed of yourself, I am also LDS."
negative,"As Bad a Production as Possible: This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like ""The School for Scandal"" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD."
positive,"Great Characterization & Setting; Victorian Realism: I was enchanted with Dorotha who had to overcome those typical barriers on females in the Victorian age. Timeless story in all aspects, you begin to take in the ways of life in the past, the bust and the corsets, the quiet gossip behind others backs.George Eliot is a wonder of a writer, she needs more attention in high schools and colleges, her books entertain as well as challenge."
positive,Outstanding Flavor No Calories: This is such a great product. So glad Amazon is carrying it ... Great flavor without the calories. I not only add it to my coffee but it's also great added to cake & cookie mixes (Just crush the tablets before adding to the mix) All the flavors taste terrific. LOVE IT!
positive,converse all stars: Quick delivery and item was just as described. These are pretty hard to find so I was very happy to get these for my husband
negative,"uh,...: Maybe I'm not that bright....but I didn't get it. Some good actions scenes though and fans Tom Cruise and the original TV series seem to enjoy it. Worth a rental I guess."
negative,"YEA-RITE!!!!!!: man I feal sorry for the one who got theres for $66.00 i would hav given mine to him mine broke the same day i got it, and wal*mart wouldent give me a re-found becou i threw away the box and stuff...........................OVER-ALL, this cam, is dead wieght. I boght it to film skateing with me and my friends, and it F#$%ed up the same day I was the damn laghing stalk for the day. so..... take my advise and get the {Samsung Hi8&#153; Camcorder- SAM SCL906} for $299.00 at circut city or www.circutcity.com"
positive,"O'Brian is one of the great treasures in modern literature: Give these stories a chance! I credit the recent film ""Master & Commander"" with making the O'Brian series more accessible. One of the best films I have ever seen, it provided a visual context for me when I read the Aubrey/Maturin books. Though the film departs quite a bit for good reason from ""The Far Side of the World"", I thoroughly enjoyed the book and O'Brian's style of writing. Especially memorable for me was the unorthodox method O'Brian applied for conclusion of the book. Victory is in the air, and he dispenses with the need to drag the book out unnecessarily. Brilliant and revelatory to me!"
negative,"No,No,No This is not for me.....: I own the vest squeem and I absolutely love it!!!!! But this waist cincher is not for me. I'm not gonna say don't buy it because alot of women are shaped different.I just got it yesterday and I'm sending it back. It fit well until my back fat overlapsed over the top of the cincher and thats not attractive at all. So if you know you have more than enough back fat, this is not for you. I tried to adjust it by pulling it up or down and that didnt even help. I wear a size medium, so its my correct size. But it doesnt give me the full coverage support that the vest gives me. The vest covers all the back fat and everything. But I still give Squeem thumbs up though!!! :-)"
positive,NU-SALT: I have been using this product for many years. I'm very happy with this product. I would recommend this product to anyone who have to watch thier salt intake.
positive,"great finish: Well done, a bit of a fairy tale ending whereby all the loose ends seem to be tied up, not as poetic as the first part, ""Jean de Florette"", but the surprises and the lessons about what makes life really worthwhile are still very powerful!"
positive,"Make your own tomacco: I bought this to make my own tomacco, but now my hands are covered with sores that don't seem to be healing."
negative,"Egg on his face: Good God this is a bloody awful album! This was Paul trying to ""punk"" up his image after Goodnight Tonight in 1979 but he fails miserably. The lyrics are awful . His Baby's Request is typical of Macca's love for pseudo-1930's English nostalgia. Arrow Through Me and Denny Laine's patronizing Again and Again and Again (""you don't want to be the little woman..."" - please!) are bore you to the point of suicide. His hiring every rock dinosaur alive in '79 to play on Rockestra is Macca embarking on another huge ego trip And just what the heck is the band looking at on the cover?On the original vinyl album side A was Sunny Side Up and side B was Over Easy -- get it? That seemed to be closest to originality and wit this album ever got. But with the CD version on one disk, even that was lost. Best track - Spin it On. Thank God he got arrested for pot soon after this was released -- after this mess, he desperately needed an image change."
negative,"A Rare Thing: This is the hardest rating, I think I ever had to give a movie.Halloween III is a rare thing - A movie, so bad, it transcends itself. It is one of the goofiest things, I've ever seen, and yet, my Halloween wouldn't be the same without watching this turkey. The movie is stupid, ugly, bloody, and pointless - exactly what one might enjoy on a cold, dark October night. So, if you are ever in a mood for something like this, Halloween III: Season Of The Witch is your ticket."
positive,"GOOD drama, GREAT action!!!: Very exciting with a healthy amount of drama. I'm not sure why this movie didn't do well. It has it's faults but so do many movies that others praise. My biggest complaint about this movie is it has several editing problems. Overall...It is a very entertaining action movie with a fantastic story line."
positive,"NIB2 - Excellent Disk....Minus Track 12: NIB2 is an excellent addition for anyone who enjoys ozzy (or any of the bands on this disk). The Godsmack, Primus and Pantera tracks are some of the best renditions I have ever heard. An excellent tribute to Black Sabbath; their influence on today's rock/metal bonds is enourmous. Only downside of this disk is track 12. I was unaware that Black Sabbath had much influence on today's rappers. Track 12 is a very obvious mistake, I had to re-burn the disk and remove it."
positive,"t.A.T.u: t.A.T.u. is a great new group. Like most good music they have been around longer than their music has been in the U.S. All of the music is different and mixes together nicely into this cd. A little techno, a little pop. Their lyrics are deep but still simple and universal. A great CD overall and the enhanced CD with the music video makes this CD a must have for t.A.T.u fans"
negative,"Fragile - suitable only for the Bubble-Boy, not frequent flyers: I am on my second pair of Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones - and like so many in the other reviews here both mine broke. The first time they broke I paid $100 for a replacement pair, and the replacement then started to crack in the same place as my first pair! So I quickly pulled out the black electrical tape and effected a repair before they completely broke again. My self-back-patting was shortlived however when they broke completely at the swivel joint, while I was wearing them. I treated these headphones with the utmost care and they still broke. I fly a lot and the noise cancelling really helps reduce the fatigue from the engine roar so I will try another manufacturer, probably Sennheiser. I always found the sound quality to fine, not great but when you're on an aircraft you don't expect much. But I do expect something that costs $300 to be able to stand up to the rigours of everyday life."
negative,"Why Can't I Rate at Zero Stars ?: Come On, People !!!! I checked this out because Amazon emailed me saying it was top rated.... ??? Could it be because one of the ""songs"" is entitled ""Amazon"" ? Sex appeal !? Not !!!! - unless you want to have sex with a monkey.... And for those who think this is the best album they've heard in a long time - my condolences ! Seriously, this recording is nothing more than a possibly somewhat cute girl chanting gibberish over some low-fi computer generated noise loops. True artists should be outraged, and they would if they could stop laughing. I recommend steering way way clear of this sorry excuse for music. Please, people - don't let big music money tell you what is good - we all suffer for it in the end."
positive,"If you can manage the discipline...: Dr. Barnard's ""Tackling Diabetes"" is only for those willing to listen carefully and summon up th discipline to follow his not-too-complicated Rx. It helps! I may later be able to say the type II I struggle with is gone. For the moment, I can say without hesitation, my blood sugar is considerably lower in the morning, which has been a constant problem for me. His clear, uncomplicated recommendations require commitment to a pattern of eating that can drastically reduce the presence of high glucose in one's blood, help reduce weight, and help bring about a certain amount of personal peace.My opinion is that all plans to 'self treat' diabetes should be shared with one's doctor."
positive,"Great writer, great book: If you are looking for a writer who churns out well-crafted mystery novels with believable characters, G. M. Ford is one of the best. ""Black River"" is the second in a nw series with Frank Corso. I just finished it last night and am anxious to read the next. Ford's Leo Waterman series is equally good."
positive,"Mean Guns: This movie is not for everyone. The story line is good but some parts of the movie are just to far fetched to make this a great movie. But if want something different like watching a solid 90 minutes of over a hundred people geting shot, stabbed ,and/or beaten to death. THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE!"
negative,"A Truly Aweful Film: This film has it all! An absolutely preposterous plot, some really bad acting (from Kenneth Branagh of all people!), and regrettable casting choices (e.g., Robin Williams as a disgraced ex-psychiatrist forced to work as a grocery store shelf stocker and Wayne Knight--Newman on Seinfeld--who [sorry Wayne!] will always be Newman and therefore should not be cast in any serious movie).Among its other sins, at times this ""thriller"" seems to think it's a comedy. If you're a fan of Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson's other fine works, you'll especially want to skip this one.It's a real shame--after wasting $8-$10 on this movie, you'll naturally want to see it to its conclusion despite all the warning signs that it's not going to get any better. At that point not you've not only wasted $8-$10, but also nearly 2 hours of your life. I'm a movie fan and a collector, but this one's going out with the next garbage pick-up."
negative,"This album is not for everyone: I found this to be an exercise in unpleasant listening, musically, not lyrically. Just because you like soul or r&b doesn't mean this album is for you."
positive,"Fighting. What else do you need in a martial arts movie?: I like this movie for 3 reasons.1. They don't waste too much time getting the plot started and once they get to the action its basically one fight after the other.2. Van Damme can't act and he didn't try too. He just beat up a bunch of people and did his neat little jump kick a few times, which is what he does best.3. It has Bolo Yeung in it."
negative,"Tastes terrible!: I've never heard of a Uranium flavored Oreo, but thought I would give it try. Based on the taste alone, this stuff is not worth it."
positive,Very good heart wrenching story: I read this book many years ago. I was touched by her story. I can not speak for the Kindle formatting on this. Only to the books content. Excellent.
negative,too thin to hold weight: this product is good for child I guess..cause it is a little thin...but it is better than the one I saw on sports authority which is thiner
negative,"Not worth buying: First, this pencil sharpener only has one ""blade"" inside to sharpen the pencil. Without having a second, opposing blade inside, the pencil is always pushed away from the blade and sharpens off-center.Next, the vacuum base never stays put through even a single sharpening cycle.And the final straw, the other day, after having this for less than six months, the plastic shavings receptacle came apart (it's two pieces glued together), spewing sawdust and pencil graphite all over everything.I strongly recommend against this one."
negative,"copy shop edition: The stars are for the edition, not the book.The April 30, 2011 edition from CreateSpace (which probably actually is a copy shop) does not look like a book. It looks like a leaflet from Jehova's witnesses. It's flimsy, in a weird large format, and with no information about publisher, date of publishing etc. If you have any aesthetic sensibility you should get a different edition of this classic book.This type of product should either come with a warning ""not a real book"" or not be sold on amazon at all."
negative,"Broken out of the box: Put the pump (brand new out of the box) in a refilled/clean pond with everything perfectly clean. Worked for about an hour before it started stuttering. Sounded like air or something was caught in the impeller, but its perfectly clean, the pump is submerged completely. Pulled off the impeller to see if anything was caught, but it was perfectly clean. The Danner Mfg website is of no help. Also for the 1 hour or so it did work, the output was much less than expected (barely more than my 300gph we were replacing). All in all I'm quite disappointed."
positive,It's a little more than Do Matcha but worth the money!: I was trying to make a ice cold green tea frappaccino here at home like Starbucks but hot was even better. I plan to add it to all my tea drinks. Thanks!
negative,"Crapped out on me.: Sure enough, I tried to get away cheap, and got bit in the you-know-where for it. Three months after buying it, the card is unusable. The lifetime guarantee? You need the original packaging and receipt. I suppose I can only really blame myself for not saving it all, but hey, it was a well reviewed $20 card, right? So now it's a holiday, with everyplace closed, and I have no flash card. You get what you pay for."
negative,"Not For Commoners!: I read this book in the hopes of gaining a helpful framework for thinking about - and perhaps even achieving - my ""number"" for retirement, but that is not what I found between its covers. Mostly the book concerns itself with the soul - searching and anguish that people who have 1 - 10 million dollar ""nest eggs"" go through in trying to decide if its enough to support them in the manner to which they have become accustomed, until such time as they pass on. Although I really FEEL for these people, my financial situation is much more in sync with the run-of-the-mill American, and for us Mr. Eisenberg has barely a mention, let alone advice. On a positive note, I did find his writing style to be very engaging. Bottom line - I would have to recommend that you avoid this book and use the time saved to read something more useful and/or fun."
negative,"OK, So he's got a good voice......: .....Big freakin' deal!!! It doesn't make up for how much the music stinks!If you are reading this right now, that means you are probably pondering whether to buy this junk. And that makes you an idiot. How can you support something like this? This comes from a really bad TV show that is not even watchable unless your brains are mashed potatoes!Neil Young said it best when asked what he thought of Clay Aiken and the whole American Idol thing: ""Well, he ain't Jerry Garcia."" Exactly. Jerry actually had heart and put emotion into his music.Do yourself a favor and go listen to some real music, not this goober completely butchering The Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel."
positive,"Better Than I Thought: I bought the Jwin JXM for ten dollars because I read a review that claimed it's better than the Grundig S350. I was skeptical but intrigued, so I bought the JXM and surprised at how clear the reception is on both AM and FM. This is easily the lightest radio I've ever held. Like holding a feather. The reception is strong. Don't waste time or money with an AC adaptor, which will cause interference, just use two double A batteries.Weaknesses: tuning. It's hard to tune to the exact station number and once you do, the station drifts. The only good thing is that the drift doesn't seem to adversely affect reception.This is not a perfect radio by any means. I didn't expect it to be for ten dollars, but I keep it in my brief case and use it at work when a baseball game is on and my office interference impedes reception of my ""plug-in"" radios."
positive,"Five Stars For Children's Version: This is an excellent adaptation that leaves out some of the more sinister elements/overtones. There are no bawdy barroom scenes. Levity is provided by the addition of several animals. Oliver has a pet toad named Squeakers, Fagin has a parrot that ""parrots"" back Fagin's words (even when it gets him in trouble), there are a few more birds in the thieves abode and a cat. Naturally the cat scraps with Bill Sike's dog Bullseye, providing a comedic break.Other than being somewhat disappointed/annoyed by the lack of ""color"" in Fagin's voice, I found this thoroughly entertaining. It follows the book quite well for a 90 min. version. It is for the young set, grades K-1 to 5-6.It will be more palatable to many families than the G rated Broadway film, Oliver Twist, The Musical. The latter is more touching, heartbreaking, and real for some sensitive youngsters. It is over the top wonderful for all... except ages 0-7 or 8.Addl Note---My copy says 1973 on the back."
negative,"Abridged: While it doesn't indicate it, this is a heavily abridged version of the story, and pretty much just deals with the elements contained in the 2002 film. It's still a good story, but gets 2 stars for not indicating that it's abridged, and because even at 1400 pages, the full unedited story by Dumas is MUCH richer and makes for a much more satisfying story. Do not cheat yourself of that satisfaction by settling for 1/3 of the story."
positive,"Great Album: I was a Soundgarden fan. I was a Temple of the Dog Fan. Now Im a Cornell fan. Im glad he decided to pursue his music after Soungarden's breakup, and I love the change his music has taken. This is a great album that I will be listening to and playing along with for a long time to come. Im looking forward to hearing more in the future."
positive,"Wow.: So You Want to Be a Wizard is the book that the first of the Harry Potter's books really wanted to be, and almost became. While tapping into the universal desire to be somebody Great and Important, the Duane book does it in a way that is identifiable not just by but with every child who has felt like an outsider. (Which is to say: with every child.)Oh, stop reading these reviews and just order the book. It's that good."
positive,"One of the best Catholic movies ever: This is an amazing Catholic movie which portrays the entire life of the great Saint Padre Pio. It shows his humility, his struggles with the devil, and everything an orthodox Catholic and Christian would want out of a film. It doesn't overlook the temporal problems of the Catholic Church such as the pride, jealousy, and vindictiveness of the powerful opponents of Padre Pio, but it portrays this not as if most of these opponents were evil, but simply that they did not understand, and even in Padre Pio's words they were simply trying to protect the Church. The importance of the three religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience come to the forefront in this film in many ways. This movie has an amazing ending so it is worth watching until the end."
positive,"Fantastic, because it based on a unbelieveable true story: If this was a fictional story it still would be a good story.The plot seems proposterous and not within the relm of reallity, but it actually worked and is credited with saving thousands of lives both American and British. Patton and Montgomery would have had a much harder time taking Sicily if not for this brillient piece of espinoage. No vulgar language, no gore, just a good movie to watch. Well worth your time."
positive,technical information: THe product was exactly as described and I would buy future items from this seller
negative,Jennifer Love Hewitt flops as Audrey Hepburn: Jennifer Love Hewitt doesn't look a thing like Audrey Hepburn. I truely believe that the producers and casting directors made a terrible call casting Hewitt. The actress who I believe reminds people of Audrey as well as looks like her is Natalie Portman (who is an exceptional actress). Natalie would have made a much mcuh better Audrey Hepburn.
positive,"perfect diaper: ive been purchasing diapers for years.these are perfect they are soft,absorb well even at night.they work better than the new cruisers.i have bought these and cruisers,the old ones worked well.the new ones leak everywhere especially infront.i have never had a poo leak from these diapers.unless your child has diarrhea there shouldnt be any leaks.these are also a better value than the cruisers."
positive,"It will go with you in your mind...: By far, one of my favorite books for children. I love reading it to my babies. The text with the beautiful pictures will go with you in your mind forever..."
negative,"Pure JUNK: Do not trust this vendor, these blades are pure junk. I bought these in September, and finally got around to using them today (I buy these in bulk and these finally got into the rotation). These blades are dull, and do not lubricate the face when used. I suspect these are fake Gillette blades due to extreme poor quality. Since I bought these a few months ago, I have no way of returning these for a refund. So I lost my money on these junk blades. When a deal is too good to be true, it is.DO NOT BUY THESE BLADES, THEY ARE FAKES AND WILL RIP YOUR FACE OFF WHEN YOU USE THEM."
positive,Grounded For Life: I dont agree with all the views of this book and quickly passed it on. It discusses some valuable advice for new parents of teenagers.
negative,"Dune, the book: 5 stars. Dune, the kindle version: 1 star: Dune is an amazing journey, and anyone who has thought of reading definitely should. However, I want to know why the Kindle version is more expensive than any other version?! I'm starting to get REALLY sick of all this. Well, Amazon got their $189 out of the person who bought the Kindle itself for me, but they sure won't get any more money from me for books that are outrageously overpriced."
negative,"a disappointing end to a great series: I've been following this series all the way from its beginning with the Empire of the East series and I was extremely disappointed with the seemingly rushed way this one was written. Egad, what a goofy way to explain the Emperor figure. I was hoping for an intelligent tie in back to the Empire of the East premise, but ah well. The rest of the series is great."
negative,"Exceptionally Poor Quality Reproduction: The 1968 BBC performance of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" was terrific. Unfortunately, as others have noted by others here, the quality of this reproduction of that performance is abysmal. Absolutely abysmal. THe color is uneven and faded, and the sound uneven as well. It is most unfortunate that this fine production by a sterling cast should be so degraded in this edition. This is a movie which really is in want and need of a proper treatment.This version is not such a treatment."
positive,"Wonderful: This bible is wonderful! I wanted a Bible that was small and light weight enough to travel with, but also one that was comfortable as a ""real"" (As apposed to pocket) size. The cover is really nice quality, and several people have thought it was real leather. It stays open on your lap and wont flop shut. The type is very well designed, comfortable reading size, simple yet effective lay out. I love it!"
positive,"Sorry, I liked it: It is Franklin's ""regularness""--his down-to-earth regularity--that makes this such a great story. Here is a great man who was accomplished in many fields showing us that he is just a regular guy who worked hard. I, for one, don't need to be drowned in pedantry to consider a work valid. He was not attempting to make a philisophical treatise, he was just telling his life's story for the benefit of his son. It is an inspriing story of success filled with amusing anecdotes and common-sense. Read it!"
negative,"Pretty Basic: Okay for a costume, but cheap materials, especially sunglasses. Easy to put on, but just so so. Probably wouldn't buy again."
negative,"MCAFEE STINKS: Nothing but troubles with McAfee....don't do it! Came ""free"" with new computer. Screwed up my whole system. Went back to Norton Anti-virus and am 100% satisfied. All my problems went away when uninstalling McAfee."
negative,"Im having a little faith in Mandy: I've just listend to the snippets of this CD but ""Have A Little Faith In Me"" is the only good song on this CD in my opinion, not a good idea to make a whole cover CD (hence Coverage), I love Mandy's voice but she sounds awful compared to the original artists, if only one or two songs were covered along with original work it would've been way better, hopefully Mandy's next CD will make up for this one, ""I Wanna Be With You"" is Mandy's best CD to date."
positive,Great Page Turner: I couldn't put this book down. It was very in depth and made me question the bonds of loyalty and family and the choices we must make in our lives. Shows how different things used to be. Kept my attention the whole time and I loved all the surprises along the way!
positive,"Amazing Live!!!!!!: I heard ""It's a Dream"" and ""He was the King"" on Saturday Night Live. Canadians have SO much to be proud of in their musicians with people like Neil Young coming from this great country"
negative,junk: this is the worst band i have everheard in my life. I would rather listen to debbie gibson all day long.their politics are lame and their chord changes are boring and uncreative.more like the worst cd of 2001.
negative,Confusing: who ever wrote this dumb confusing book is in a mental state of mind! Fahrenheit 451 is a overworded description of a fireman who lives on rebellion! It is a bad influence on the young people of the world. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNED!
positive,"baby dry diapers: Baby dry diapers are not quite as soft as the swaddlers, but they haven't leaked at all and I definitely like them better than any Huggies diaper."
negative,"A Story Already Told: I had heard good things about this book, but was disappointed. This story had already been told in this format, and been told better, by Studs Terkel in his book The Good War. Terkel interviewed more persons, let them tell their own story, and interviewed persons who had been successful as well as those that had not. Brokaw focuses only on those that had gone on to become successful, while Terkel includes those from all walks of life. If you are interested in reading a history in this format, I would recommend The Good War over The Greatest Generation."
positive,"Great!: I purchased this as a graduation gift for my hubby. He loves it! It prevents him from making (and wasting) a half pot of coffee in our ""daily"" coffee maker. The varieties you can purchase are numerous! I even purchased the ""my K-cup"" thing so we can brew our own coffee (Community Coffee from LA). We also think it's neat that the water holder ""glows"" in the dark a blue color. So far, this purchase is great."
positive,The Past Comes Alive!: i just finished watching this movie for the first time in over 15 years and what a trip. I can't believe it. This is a great movie really takes you back to the good'ol days of decent toys and GREAT cartoons. The DVD is fine no frills but hey this movie makes up for it. A classic...
negative,"This is NOT a children's book!: I picked this book up for my son, age 7, who likes cats. I was thinking that we could read it together. I started reading the book on my own to see what it was like. This book is NOT for young children. I don't want to have to explain to my son what at ""Cutter"" is and why cat's would be afraid of it. I don't think that young children should be hearing about the pleasure that cats (or any animals) get from a fresh kill. Those just aren't the types of things I want to introduce to him at his age. This book should really be targetted for older children (teenagers), not young readers. Besides the issue of the target audience, I do feel the writer does capture the feelings of cats as best as a human can capture an animals ""feelings"", but I also think that the writing is not particularly polished or engaging. I would not recommend this book."
positive,"If only the ""bad-guys"" weren't straw-men....: Damn good series. Especially enjoyed the alternate-history angle--what-if? Mr. Turtledove is a master at that.I just wish he'd written some aliens with even a little bit of ability/intelligence/luck/you name it. The series starts out with them on top, and they go downhill from there. I've finished the series, and I don't recall a single time that things went their way. Sure they're the bad guys. Sure we want the humans to win. But, PLEASE, give us a bad guy that's a little tougher. Put me in just a _little_ suspense as to the outcome.That said, I still bought and read the whole series. :-}"
positive,Great product: These were great for the price have had no problems with them no errors and play extremely clear very durable
negative,"Diaper leaked after 7 hours on the first night: I bought these because my 6 month old started leaking with her Pamper Swaddlers. These said that they were for overnight protection and would last 12 hours. When I opened the package I was surprised to see that these are thinner than Swaddlers and plastic feeling. I can handle that as long as I don't have to clean urine off of my daughter, her pajamas, and her bed every morning. She sleeps 12 or so hours some nights, but still wakes up for a feeding on most nights. When she woke up after 7 hours for a feeding, her clothes were soaked. Very disappointing. Pick up a small package before you buy the value size to see if they work for you. These diapers did not work for my daughter."
negative,"There are far better tapes out there...: If you are looking for a tape to dance ""with"", this isn't it.It's more like a documentary on dance."
positive,Amazing Resource: This non-fiction book is used every year in my 4th grade class. It is a great addition to the Iditarod unit that I teach! It's loaded with artistic drawings and anecdotes. The kids love it! Highly recommend.
negative,Dance with the Devil: This movie was ridiculously overpriced. The acting is horrible; the plot is nonexistent. The DVD didn't even have so much as a commentary track. I guess I learned my lesson--never give Rosie Perez a second chance.
positive,Enter the Night: I enjoyed it. A nice read and a wild walk into the macabre. It's quite a revelation in self discovery through the art of passive observance on the part of the main character. The descriptive narratives were superb.
positive,"Book review: The book, The Sorcerer Metamorphosis, by Jack Whyte, is another adventure tale of King Arthur. With the ageing of Arthur, he is welcomed back to his home, Camulod. Arthur's arrival has been one step closer to his crowning of High King of Briton. Merlin has gone lengths to ensure the crowning of the true king, Arthur. The close families encounter troubles, and some friends don't make it. This book is a thrilling tale that is worth every star in gets."
negative,"Anti Sabermetric garbage: I love Tony LaRussa, as I'm an A's fan. However, Bissinger has an agenda with this book. He wants it to be the anti Moneyball. He doesn't believe in the philisophy of using statistics to judge performance and make decisions. He has said this, and attacked Michael Lewis' Moneyball without offering any kind of decent rebuttal. He goes on some rant that humans aren't machines and that the human element is important. Yes, every person is different ""Buzz,"" and statistics are just a way of quantifying those differences. 4 postseason appearances for the A's and a world series title for the Red Sox bear out the success of sabermetrics. It's here to say, despite the fact that stubborn baseball people hate it because it destroys so much of their outmoded and inefficient ideas and strategies."
positive,"Bought this as a gift: My husband wanted this movie for Christmas. He loved the additional information provided with the movie. It is a very well made war movie. It included actually footage of film taken during the war, other war movies and some additional interviews of people that were there."
negative,It gets sticky!: Title says it all. It gets sticky fast. I would recommend Wet Platinum over this product.
negative,After using this switched to Schick Quattro: I had been using Gillette razors for last 15 years. Every time they came up with better product until this one. The blade life is so short for fusion and that made me try to use Schick Quattro. I have been using the first blade of Quattro for last 4-5 months and blades stay healthy. Quattro is only just a little less comfortable compared to new fusion but stays fresh for much long. I am not switching back to Gillette.
negative,"My boys don't play with Kasey: My son received this as a Christmas present when he was 3. I also have a 5 year old son. My 3 year old has never shown any interest in this toy. My five year old has played with it briefly about 2 times. Kasey sits and collects dust in our toy room. I feel bad that Grandma paid so much money for a toy that has not been used by either of my boys. My boys enjoy educational computer games and I think Kasey was a little boring for them compared to the computer. To be honest, I found him a little boring compared to the educational software that we have as well!"
negative,Should be Free with purchase of Belkin OmniView. Why sell separate?: This item should come free with a Belkin OmniView. Seems amazon and sellers are deliberately selling separate to make more money by charging shipping and handling for an item that should ship with Belkin OmniView when a customer is purchasing one.
positive,"This could be the best yet...: In some ways I think this is Bebel's best album to date. Her music on this album exudes sensuality and sex appeal in a relaxed and mellow way. I am amazed that some fellow reviewers did not feel this from listening to this album. I have counted 2 so-so songs out of the whole entire album. The rest of the album is awesome, hence why I give 4 instead of five stars. Looking back on her other albums I found that there were always a few songs that were just so-so compared to the other songs on the album. She again beautifully fuses electronic and organic elements on this album. She shifts between the slower more intimate songs like ""Close to You"" and ""Night and Day"" to more festive songs like ""Cadaca"" and the great ""Os Novos Yorkinos"" (one of my favorites). All in all I think the songs are well arranged, Bebel's sounds great as always, and you should buy this if you liked her other albums."
negative,"Choking Hazard: The spout on this cup is very dangerous. It tends to crack and split apart causing small pieces to break off. I purchased two of these cups and within a short amount of time the spout on both cups cracked. Fortunately, I discovered the problem before pieces actually broke off in my son's mouth. I believe this product should be recalled and I'm writing to Playtex to make sure they know about it."
negative,"Exercise in Frustration: The aerobics section of the video--which is, of course, the longest section--is a disaster. The moves are complicated, change very frequently, and are given little or no verbal explanation. To make matters worse, the camera almost always remains at the front, rarely giving a side view of the acitvity--even though it's desperately needed in order to have any hope of deciphering the group's complicated footwork.I chose this video because I'd been very happy with the Jane Fonda exercise video is used back in my college days (over 10years ago). Needless to say, I was very disappointed. While I might occasionally use the video's stretching segment, I doubt I'll ever again use the aerobics section again . . . pretty disappointing considering that I primarily bought it for the cardiovascular workout."
positive,"awesome. period.: This was worth every penny spent, plus a hundred more. The upconversion, depending on the source, is brilliant and seemless. For Dvd sources it's amazing. Xvid and divx completely depends on your source, but it's played everything thrown at it; and I've thrown a lot at it. The USB interface is quite simple and has yet to cause any problems. Buy this player if you're on the fence about BlueRay."
negative,Not As durable as i hoped: Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price. I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction. I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time.
positive,"Still great: I first read The Hobbit in middle school, and even after more than twenty years it is as great as when I first discovered this gem."
negative,pretty but not very comfortable: This bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable. The lace cups isn't feel like flour sack material.
negative,"Err... When does it start getting good, ar kid?: There are the odd (2, I think) Hammond tracks which have a bit of life about them, but if you are into nodding your head, you'll be perplexed when the meandering spoken-word tracks kick in. Apparently to live in Norway and be a dog is a great way of life. Yeah, I'll give that a go Bugge, thanks for the advice.I also own Bugge's ""Moving"", which is a much grooooovier proposition. I give that 3.5 Stars, for tracks 1 and 3 alone."
negative,this album sucks: hey coley there were two songs at the house party or actually 3 the first was it's tricky by run dmc off their album raising hell..the second was black steel in the hour of chaos by public enemy off their album it takes a nation of millions to hold us back...i may be wrong on the album name though..and last but not least motley crue's don't need nothing but a good time..hope this helps ya out....the good music is MIA on the soundtrack so people save your money!!!!
negative,"Disappointing: This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style."
positive,"The great(est) American novel.: If you consider America the landmass on both sides of the equator betwixt the Atlantic and Pacific -- then American literature is truly enriched by everything that's written between Baffin Island and Cape Horn. As a young student in high school in American lit we read Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, Fitzgerald -- great reading to be sure -- but only one slice of the expansive American experience. It wasn't until college and when I read Garcia Marquez's 100 Years -- that the American novel took on a new and wonderful meaning. A work vibrant and unique, with undertones of the old world, but one still wholly and distinctly a creation of this side of the world. 100 Years is as impressive as Moby Dick, Gatsby, Huck Finn -- and a novel of uncommon beauty, vision, and style"
positive,"Hi-Tec Boots Altitude IV: This is my 2nd pair. This pair was stiff and needed some break in, but feel great now.Would recommend"
positive,"Very good, stunning !: The great differential in this metal band from Finland is the presence of a female singer. Other than this, the keyboarder writes all the songs, which is also unusual in a metal band. Because NIGHTWISH is metal, sheer European metal, but with style and precision. There's no great concern with fast guitar solos, just good music being played. But this CD shows clearly that they have evoluted. This is much better than "" ANGELS FALL FIRST""."
positive,"DEFINITELY worth the wait: Who knew they still had it in them? Mick and Keith can still crank out a fine set of tunes, and there's a great set of them here. To be honest, I can't think of one song that I would skip on this disc. Even the ""Angie""sequel ""Streets Of Love"" has grown on me, and is actually pretty good. Of course, ""Rough Justice"" ""Back of My Hand"" ""Look What the Cat Dragged In"" ""Dangerous Beauty"" and all vintage Stones tunes, and stand out to me more than anything of Bridges to Babylon. The real stunners for me are actually ""She Saw Me Coming"", which some knock as repetitive but I was bowled over by it upon first listening, and Keith's closer ""Infamy"", which has yet to stop playing through my head. All Stones fans should own this, no doubt. Its just a matter of time until this one gets thrown in there next to ""Some Girls"" ""Tattoo You"" and ""Aftermath"". Probably not the big four though, as no one will ever top that batch."
negative,"No fatal flaws on this one: We bought two dashmats on Amazon for two different cars. The other one was so badly done we had to send it back. This one only had one flaw, a silly 1""x6"" flap that was mis-sewn and hung wrong. No matter how long you let it sit, it would never look right. We folded it under and now the dashmat looks ok. Maybe cut it off someday and resew the piping to make it look like a professional job.As I've said in another review, Dashmat products we ordered on Amazon don't seem to be the quality they once were. I'm looking at other brands from now on."

negative,"Will Never Buy Pampers Again: I have to believe we got a defective lot, but the right hand side adhesive tab tears itself free on about 2 out of 3 diapers that we put on our newborn--after the diaper is on the baby and her clothes are buttoned up. We have resorted to medical tape to hold the diapers together. This is our 3rd child, so we're pretty sure we aren't trying to put them on too tight."
positive,"Very authentic: This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it."
negative,"Ridiculous!: I sent this unit back to Amazon! Its form factor is contrary to what it says.The camera is small, as they state, but attached to it is a bulky power cable and 9v battery connector. When you hook it all up it's huge! No longer a stealthy camera. Ridiculous!It does not serve its intended purpose.MUVI turned out to be my replacement choice. All reviews are excellent. The image is excellent and it records for hours on an internal battery. There are lots of examples on YouTube.TaosGuy"
negative,"Why oh why...: people keep making such crap films? This is can be ranked as one of the WORST FILMS EVER (along such ""masterpieces"" as ""I want to get married"", ""Hey happy"" or ""Denied"").Acting is so horrible that I had really made myself to watch this ""horror"" till the end titles...Plot? Even worse.There are some full nudity scenes in, but believe me, 90% of blue movies is better than ""Watch out""!I have found a couple of positive reviews on Amazon.com, but I am really puzzled reading them. How anyone could find this drag thing attractive?I wish I could give big zero *.You have been warned!"
positive,"A Smile Like Yours Made Me Cry: Just because a critic doesn't like a movie and has to vent his/her opinion on it, does not mean that the entire movie-going public has to hate it either. Not many critics liked Wild, Wild, West, but I, and many other people enjoyed it. Same with a smile like yours. If at times it became hokey or even suggestive, it doesn't matter because in my view it was very well done and meaningful. It shows what people are willing to do for love because of how powerful love truly is. When the gynecologyst put that huge, curved instrument into Lauren Holly's nether-region, that took love on her character's part."
positive,"Try it-you'll like it: Once you try it,you will be spoiled for anything else. It saves on storage.After programing you watch at your convenience & delete or save for another time. Tivo is one of the greatest inventions."
negative,"The most goyish jewish mother in the world.: However did they convince us Streep was the best actress of her time? The female De Niro! Here she tops even her Lindy Chamberlain Australian travesty. Australians still laugh at her accent in that ""performance"". Here she channels Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie to play a wooden Jewish psychologist. Her ""Jewish"" mannerisms do not ring true at all. All stereotypes and woodenness. Merryl honey, find me a New York Jewish psychologist as inarticulate and mumbling as the one you portrayed. Yeah right! The plot is weak and strained as it tries to parlay a single idea into a whole movie. Uma Thurman is the best thing in this movie and that's pretty faint praise my friends.Avoid this film like the plague. It has the feeling of made for TV at best."
positive,"Wow!: Yoga For Surfers is one of the best DVDs I own! I am convinced it is by far, the best yoga tape. Even as a beginner, I can see how it has helped me become more flexible and with such amazing surfing and how radiant Peggy is on-screen, I can't help but get inspired every time I watch it!"
negative,"THIS MOVIE [STINKS]: Normally I would never write a review, I just don't. But as we have all learned from this past week, terror stirrs us to action. Don't even spend time thinking about spending money on this movie. This movie was almost as bad as Battlefield Earth! Plus, it is in some pre-order competition with the Simpson's Complete 1st season, so don't let the world think that this moivie is even a little good! Help Brendan Fraiser save the world from the Mummy, by not buying it, or even talking about it, or saying the name of the movie out loud!"
positive,"Heavy duty.: I read many conflicting reviews on this before I bought it. I haven't had any problems with the bottom rubber piece coming off, and the handle has never filled with water in the dishwasher. It is fairly large, but just perfect for my need. It's so heavy duty, mine seems like it will last for a very long time. I love it."
positive,"If this doesn't get you dancing, you have no pulse!: The single, ""Galang"" explodes like computerized firebombs! All quaking synths and bells and whistles and a beat that would get the dead to dance. Those who are expecting more run-of-the-mill ""crunky"" R&B can look elsewhere for that dreck. The album's combination of dancehall, Brazilian funk, grime and house with M.I.A.'s chirpy, sexy raps is hands down one of the best albums of the year. Own it now!!!"
negative,"is that fencer attacking with a bent arm?: and what is with the foot?Usually a preview should (as far as I know) show a good example that will motivate people to watch moreof it and this just isn't it...I haven't viewed the video or part you can download as yet but if this picture is an example of what it contains I am not too inclined to view more of it...what are these two fencers doing?is the one on the right attacking with a foot in the air,next arm and point way off target or are they retreating ?and if so what the .. are they doing? Balance?!?and the fencer on the left - are they attacking? bent arm? what is with the front foot?ok so maybe need to download it and view it but I have enough faults in my technique without viewing this....sorry was just looking up fencing on amazon and found this video download...sighand if you are wondering I have over 20 years of fencing - all three weapons and I like to think (some... may disagree...lol) that I am an ok fencer..."
negative,"it makes no sense: Halloween III has nothing to do with Michael Myers and the orginal Halloween. The box office sales were even below Halloween II,the movie was so poorly made. That Halloween IV,was called,the return of Michael Myers to boost ticket sales. Halloween II-H20 are nothing more than a joke as Halloween 4,5,6 show an ageing Donald Plesance."
negative,Amazing movie but a Horrible DVD: This is a horrible release of this classic!! Everything is horrible from the picture quality to the cover art.
positive,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn: I ordered this book as it was my book club selection, very sure I would not find it terribly interesting. What a surprise it turned out to be! This is a very readable, colorful story of an immigrant family in early 1900's Brooklyn. With every page, Betty Smith carried me away to these neighborhoods and ethnic communities. I loved the trip."
positive,Very interesting: Long movie but very well done. Good costuming. Good acting....Loved Peter Ustinov. Was recommended by our church. Glad I saw it. More Catholics should see this to get a better understanding of religious history.
positive,"Worth the price!: I move between places a lot and hence can't afford to buy permanent bed frames and mattresses. I wanted to buy this portable bed and use it for everyday sleep and also as a standby couch. It's been serving the purpose well so far for the couple of weeks. I've gotta wait and see if any major leaks occur in the future.Here's the reason for the missing star. It never becomes flat or very saggy, but needs air top up daily for sure. Especially since I'm using this also as a couch to sit, sometimes I need to inflate it for a couple of minutes before going to sleep to get the firmness I want. Of course it is absolutely not as comfortable as a box spring mattress on a frame, but I can assure that this is definitely worth the bucks if the need is an inexpensive temp bed for everyday use.By the way, this very same model costs $89 in Walmart when I checked, hope now it is not!"
negative,"Eragon this, Eragon that, I don't see the point.: Don't get me wrong, I think its well written. And almost every modern fantasy writer draws on LOTR alot. But they have the advantage of doing it more...subtley.But even that might have been excusable if it had been a bit more interesting with a slight hint of unique style. I also agree with everyone else in that it was predicdtable. But the thing that really annoyed me? The fact that Eragon did not seem real. Even Brom seemed more realistic than the main character. And the way that Paolini kept on dropping BIG hints that Eragon was going to have this romantic love affair. That has really put me off the next book. And I wonder who the lover is going to be? A beautiful elf. My advice is to read Terry Prattchet instead who at least uses characters who seem stereo-typical but really are as unpredictable as you can get."
negative,"SHELTERS OF STONE - A Disappointment: I have read the other books in the series and waited anxiously for this one. This latest is so repetitive that I don't really believe Jean Auel wrote it. An example is that the Mother's Song is about three pages long and is repeated three times. When Ayla is introduced to members of Jondalar's family, the lengthy formal introduction is repeated each time she meets a new member, and there are about two hundred members. It is not until about the last three chapters that the book picks up the pace and we begin to get a story line. Maybe this is where Jean began to write. The novel could be considerably condensed by tightening up the prose and eliminating the redundancy. Where was the editor? I felt embarrassed for the author. I probably will read the final book, but I certainly hope it is an improvement."
negative,"Great series, bad discs: I bought this series two years ago and loved it! The only problem I had with the discs was what one reviewer stated, that disc one got stuck part way through episode two, and all the rest of the discs played fine. A few months ago I sat down to watch the series again and now almost every disc will not play past the half way point! I have A LOT of DVDs and this has never happened. But there is good news! The entire series is available in a boxed set from Yesasia.com. It is the Korean release with English subtitles (which are pretty good)and is on sale for $230. I've only watched two discs so far but have had no problems. Apparently MBC Korea has something that MBC America does not... quality control! Almost forgot, there are extras on these discs (no subtitles) that include interviews, photo shoots and outtakes. UPDATE I finally got through the entire set and had no problem with any disc."
negative,"Don't waste your time or money on this: First the good things. It cuts through ceramic tile easily and I actually had good success using the 45 degree cutting feature, although, it's a little sloppy.Now for the bad. I had problems similar to previous readers:The fence had to be modified to fit, it is very difficult to adjust, it is not accurate (you will need to use a tape measure), and the fence stripped out after about 10 cuts so it could no longer clamp to the table.This made it effectively USELESS for accurate cutting, so my day of tiling was wasted. Oh, and tiles catch on rear blade gaurd.I am now going to try and return the saw."
positive,"What an event!: Can you imagine!The three most beautiful voices singing the most beautiful songs,TOGETHER? Well now it's reality!!This cd is great!Olivia Newton-John and John Farnham make such a great duo,I really hope they'll work together again,their live redention of you're the one that I want is the first one in 20 years to match or even surpass the original one,and Olivia's live verision of Hoplessly Devoted to you,has nothing to envy to the older version!Her voice is still amazing!"
positive,"Makes Learning Fun: This is my second ""learn to crochet"" book, and I really enjoy using it as a reference and also to use as a suggestion for my friends who are learning to crochet. It has quite a few fun and modern patterns, and the instructions are laid out nicely.The one point that I don't really like is that it's a bit wordy in my opinion."
negative,"PLAYER IS INCOMPATIBLE: The movie Gladiator (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray] gives error ""THIS PLAYER IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH REGION MARKING OF THIS DISK"" while playing on Sony BDP-S380.It works perfectly on my laptop's blu ray disc drive. The picture quality is good but the audio is just okay. NOT WORTH THE ENTHUSIASM.All other bluray movies play perfectly on Sony BDP-S380. Only this particular movie is showing error.BPD firmware is already updated through internet. I have requested sony to deploy new updated firmware to solve this problem."
positive,love the car: this taxi changes its shape while driving. in this movie a cop uses a taxi driver to escort him around town to fight crime.
negative,"Bad PSU....: Pretty good PSU, cables are shorter than my previous GameXstream, which is good thing for me because it was really hard to fit those cable on my Antec P180. so far it works pretty goodUpdate: After 2 or 3 months this PSU just died on me for no apparent reason, I was downloading some stuff and set the computer to turn off when its over. When i got back home and tried the turn on my computer it just didn't had to buy another PSU. This is the second OCZ PSU that died on me in less than 6 months. I bought a Thermaltake this time, so far so good."
negative,"Confusing, Long and Boring: Was this story lost in translation? I almost gave up on this book half a dozen times, but kept on reading thinking it could only get better. Boy was I wrong!The dozens of characters blur together in an entanglement of crooked, incestuous limbs on a family tree. Even the family chart (yes, a chart) provided at the beginning of the book wasn't enough to keep the members of the Buendia family straight. Look elsewhere!"
negative,"Finches love it but so do squirrels: This is a nice looking feeder and it attracted lots of beautiful finches, but the squirrels quickly figured out how to pop out the plastic inserts so that the seed spills out onto the ground. It is a poor design to have removable inserts in the feeding ports. Overall, a waste of money as I have to buy a new one now."
negative,"Disappointed with quality: The product was received on time but the Gillete blades are not real. They are fake. I am not able to use them, they hurt so much. the blades are not sharp and not aligned properly. they don't have the serial number as the real Gillette blades have. I'll never buy anything from this retailer."
negative,"Just Not Worthwhile: I wish I hadn't spent the money . . .It follows in the same style as the other two Transformers movies, but it turns the formula up a bit. There's more action and more bickering between characters, but plot, story and character development, drama, and any semblance of intelligence are sacrificed for it.Yes, the special effects are cool, but the dialog and interaction between characters is downright painful, which kept suspension of disbelief from kicking in.If I had it to do over again, I'd rent this one."
negative,Most overrated book of the century: So if nobody understands what the heck the author is trying to say means that the book rates five stars? I think not.
positive,The Winter Solstice: The Sacred Traditions of Christmas: Excellent Book. I have been looking for ideas to celebrate the Winter Solstice as my birthday lands on this day and I enjoy having friends over for pot-luck and bonfire. This book has given me more ideas and it was good as I was hoping.
negative,"2 out of 2 - Kaput!!!: Absolutely love the design, am heartsick that my first unit and the replacement BOTH quit working after about 3-4 weeks.... local service NOT existent.... Amazon replacement policy super.... but basic design problem, methinks.... water flows all over occasionally and pc board stops working when wet with coffee..... just wish unit would work, and;or service center would be avail.... unit probably should be recalled.......Ron Romanski"
positive,"Great Little SOHO Printer: We got this printer last year and have really liked it because it works pretty fast and we wanted something to print just text so we wouldn't have to keep replacing inkjet carts. We also got aNETGEAR PS121 USB 2.0 Mini Print Serverand it has all worked on our home network pretty well together, including with a PC that runs Win 98se (which had, much to my suprise, a usb port which was mandatory to set up the print server)."
positive,"CAPONEGRO HITS THE MARK: Mary Caponegro's work demands and rewards close reading. With _Five Doubts_ she has nuzzled herself a spot among the contemporary greats. In it she is both a persistent iconolast and an adoring iconographer, at once tearing down the old myths and building new ones, for new times, Caponegro knows, demand new myths. Buy this intoxicating book. You won't regret it."
positive,"Invigorating adventure story: Michener was drawn to stories of the Klondike gold rush whilst researching material for his voluminous Alaska, and thought this story, set dominantly in Canada, too good not to publish.It is a fictional story of a few gold seekers of the Klondike gold rush, and seeks to capture the romance, the exhilaration, the recklessness, and the overall madness of the time. It is an invigorating adventure story, however if I had just one quibble, the characters for me were a little one dimensional, and the story told in a less complex manner than it probably deserved.Nevertheless a thoroughly enjoyable expose of the spirit of adventure, capturing much that is part of the northern spirit of romantic escapism and self discovery."
negative,"Hard to fill, leaks, and handles break: We were given this product as a gift and absolutely loved them at first. They are compact (compared to many grinders) and a cute design. Unfortunately we found the first flaw a few weeks later when it came time to refill for the first time. The refill doors are tiny! The only reasonable way to pour in salt was to use a paper funnel and the pepper was even worse having to be fed one peppercorn at a time through the tiny door.After the second refill the little doors started refusing to stay shut. Since they slide ""up"" to close with the way the mills sit on the shelf. They just fall down and constantly reopen with the help of gravity even when not used.We used these mills at most for 3 meals a week...2 people who aren't heavy spicers, but despite our limited use of these mills the handles broke off in under 11 months.It's a cute product if you are ok with something that is designed to not be used beyond 2-3 refills."
positive,"a metaphorical masterpiece: just finished thomas hardy's ""mayor of casterbridge,"" a book which i highly recommend.this novel is purported to be the first thriller, from which all that followed are copies.the characters in this metaphorical masterpiece operate in a never dissipating cloud of pathos which hangs over them like a vulture over a wounded fawn. the last sentence of the book illustrates: happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.once you pick up the rhythm of the writing, you will not be able to put the book down."
negative,Not Happy: As soon as I opened the package I knew something wasn't right because there was sand inside. I put them on later in the day and there was sand on my arm. I finally found the hole in one of the weights. Not happy to say the least.
negative,"Thanks: Why do I keep forgetting about these type of ""sales""???Thanks to all of the wonderful people - reviewers - who truly care about others.I'll pass on these."
negative,"Not real: well, this was not a real Disney copy of the movie. Plays fine. But for the price I expected a authentic Disney copy"
negative,"Overpriced shipping: Sure the cable costs ""1 cent"", but the shipping is 6 bucks. Kind of overpriced for such a small item, and this pricing strategy is deceptive. I would be happy paying $6 for this cable with shipping included, but I don't appreciate the seller trying to pull a fast one on their customers by pricing it this way..."
positive,"napier@sun-spot.com: The graphics are almost breathtaking and the plot leaves you sitting at the edge of your seat. The mysteries of ancient Egypt are brought to life along with ""The Mummy."" I thought this movie was the best performance yet by Brenden Fraser. If you like action, you'll want to see this one!"
positive,"Timely and uplifting: Pastor Mark gives us exactly what the title of this book implies. This is a devotional, but it reads more like a series of true mini-sermons that present biblical truths as well as practical applications of the subject matter. Many of the devotionals have a relevant story with them, and they all turn your focus back to the Bible. In a day and age when things aren't so hopeful, this is a blessing from God that really delivers what the title promises. Highly recommended!"
positive,Halo Series: This is an excellent read if you haven't already played the games. It's a great compliment to the Halo Game Series in that it provides more detail than what is presented in the games. This had a few spelling mistakes and mis-print/duplicate pages here and there.
positive,"Good Short Story Collection: This is the first book I've read by David Sedaris, and I am stupid for that. He is hilarious. This collection of short stories detail small moments in his life, ranging from childhood to present, all engaging and funny. Watch as his redneck brother applies bacon to his face (the grease holds it on there) in order to fake having huge sideburns shortly before his wedding. Read as his mother gives a dead-on but sometimes brutal running commentary on David's early 20's apartment life, and his dad drags 11 year old David to the most popular guy in school's house to demand payment on dental work done after the popular guy threw rocks at David and messed up his teeth. David always feels like he doesn't belong, doesn't feel comfortable, doesn't know what to say, but really he does all three. Witty, secretly insightful, and amazingly able to zing you with tiny, short sentences and segments that add up to a greater whole."
positive,"A sleeper hit, but one of the funniest movies ever: Wow! Where did this movie come from, I saw the poster lots of times but I thought it would be a stupid movie. Boy was I wrong, this is one of the funniest movies I have seen in ages. From the man that brought us Beavis and Butt-head, Mike Judge, who also makes an appearence in the film. If you have not seen this movie, or if you were like me, and thought it looked stupid, go rent it right now. Trust me, you won't regret it."
positive,"Awesome Book!: Eragon is a very interesting book. If you are into Fictional Fantasy stories, then this is the book for you! It has a unique way of wanting you to keep on reading. When your not reading it, you just want to read it again to see what happens in the next chapter. The book's chapters end in ways that make you want to find out what happens next. The book does that in every chapter, so its not boring and you decide to skip on to another book. This book is about a boy named Eragon, who later on finds and keeps a Dragon! The Dragons name is, Saphira. Saphira is very protective of Eragon at first but after a while, they go for wild adventures in the cool book. The book has a Fantasy way of majic, and luck. It also has it's negatives. The only negative i would say, would be that it takes a while to add up to the end of how the story will and when take place. This book is simply amazing. If you have the money or live near a library, pick it up! No fantasy book has ever been so exciting!"
positive,Awesome: Works great! This is definitely the product I've been looking for. My skin is so smooth and it really helps to clear up any acne or pimples.
positive,"nice amp!: I hooked this up to my BOSE 301 series II speakers and it really works great! I first played my iPod 5g nano through this amp, and while the sound was clean I was a bit disappointed in the volume of sound, then I played my 4g ipod touch and BAM! Much better! Better amp in the 4g iPod touch. I've got PLENTY of volume, in fact more than I'll use. No need for a sub with these 301's as I don't listen to hiphop. The amp foot print is small, discreet, and free of choices, that's really a good thing! Additionally, I like Amazon, this company is always great to do internet business with, and are very smart moving forward in this new economy...down with ebay up with AMAZON!Oh yeah, sittin' here jammin to Ozric Tenticles ""Waterfall Cities"", and it's soundin' AWESOME!"
positive,"perfect fit!: I really like the fact that amazon can ship this to my front door cheaper than me driving to the vacuum store and sitting in traffic, what a deal!"
positive,"Much better than expected !!: Crocodile Dundee II was terrible, nowhere near the class of the origin Crocodile Dundee. The third one arrived 13 years later. I would say it is way too late for a sequel. So it didn't do well at all the box office. But surprisingly the third one is much better than the second one. The story about Mick Dundee visited LA only to discover a Hollywood film company is smuggling expensive paintings from former Yugoslavia. It is quite funny and with quite a few of one liners. George Hamilton and Mike Tyson appear as cameo. The DVD itself is good. Excellent picture transfer and the Dolby 5.1 is OK. Worth at least a rental."
positive,"Cassiotone rocks: It's hard to imagine music better than this. Errr. Well. Something like that anyway.Really simple music, low-fi, extremely creative lyrics. The only downside is that it gives me a headache after an hour or so. But then again, I think that adds to the experience."
positive,"An unforgettable journey!: In my honest opinion, this was one of the best books I have ever read. Its unique setting, plot, and characters make for an unforgettable read. The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a thoughtful, impacting story. James Clavell will forever hold a fond place in my heart."
positive,"A timeless classic: The One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most interesting novel I have ever read. First it starts with a married couple who are counsins, afraid that they will have a child with a pig tail, a myth about what happens when you marry close relations. This novel has the most confusing set of characters with the same name carried on from generation to generation. And this novel has some of the most interesting events that you will ever read. As you read this novel, you can actually see each charactrer falling into their life of solitude, one by one.This novel is very good, and I highly recommend it."
positive,"BEST MACROECONOMICS TEXTBOOK AVAILABLE: Among all the textbooks I have seen in economics, I have found Mankiw's to be the best. It is clear and concise, addressing all the important intermediate issues in macroeconomics. The description of concepts is simple, and the book benefits from a three pronged approach to teaching - graphical, mathematical, and anecdotal. The student is free to choose whichever one he feels most comfortable learning from."
positive,"Nice kit: Everything you need to fix your glasses. Nice kit. Don't buy the cheap-o 2 dollar kits, you'll still be left with broken shades. Indulge (haha) in the 6 dollar kit and you'll be right as rain."
negative,"Very disappointing: This is the best movie of 2000? Nothing but gore, and more gore. The acting was horrible-Russell Crowe has two expressions, angry and stoic. This is a Ben-Hur wannabe but it fell far far short of that great movie. Sad that this pitiful excuse for a Best Picture will go down as an Oscar Winner."
positive,"The more things change....: As a writer, I was blown away! Don't let the caveman stuff put you off. This is excellent, awesome reading. Auel is a masterful story-teller, first creating a world then unfolding a story that had me turning each page with wild anticipation. I don't want to spoil anything by giving it away, but trust me, this would be money well spent on some first rate thrilling reading! I suppose I'm biased since Baby is her pet lion and my name is Lions. It's awesome story-telling!"
positive,"Important: Just under two hundred pages, I learned more from this short book on Economics than from three entire textbooks in College. Concise, well worded and simplified reality. Anyone wanting to understand the market system and how it works can gain greatly by reading Hazlitt."
negative,"Why does everybody rave when....: This product sucks!It doesn't completely suck... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight. As many people have noted, it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this wasn't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment:1) Rides up- if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2) Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist-- and it hurts3) Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down: visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice, first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side (ouch!! )RETURNING THIS!!!"
positive,"A Wonderfully Human Work.: Defoe has written of a wonderful woman with his ""Moll Flanders"", and he has also created a book that is entirely enjoyable while outlining her exploits and her life. Moll was quite a remarkable woman in her time. He covers her earlier life of crime and the punishment that ensued from that right up to her later days where she reformed. She made quite a few marriages, and learned and grew from these. Although most of her marriages and her intrigues were undertaken in the pursuit of money, she was actually not without passion or generosity. There is quite a bit of moralizing throughout the book, but it is totally enjoyable nonetheless because Moll was so human and Defoe has created a living, breathing heroine that is as realistic as they come (especially during this era). Quite an accomplishment, especially for a male author."
negative,"An unrealistic book that dosen't make sense: I think that this book is a bad book. Not only is it unrealistic, but also a boring book. Orwell has an imaginative mind, I must say, but thuis book talks about 1949, when he published it when there were such things as totalitarism. How could he know it would still be the exact same thing in 1984? This book also has strange events. The author skipped around too many times. At one sentence, he would be in the appartment in Winston's home, and without telling a reason for it, he would be some where else. The book is also boring. There is not enough action and suspense to make the reader willing to read it."
negative,"KIM ROBY-I WANT MY MONEY BACK!: Casting the First Stone, a novel which supposedly exposes corruption in the church family, failed miserably. It really exposes corruption in the literary community by passing itself off as quality literature and ripping off hundreds of readers looking for substance and quality. Kimberla Roby has not mastered the writing craft and this book shows it. The words don't sing, they huddle together like a clumps of gooey mess staining over two hundred pages. The characters are shallow, the writing is repetitive, and the writer insists on telling the reader information they already know. Page after page after page, the writer tortured her readers with needless nonsense, perpetrating the myth of keeping a family together and then she turns around and commits adultery. Do two wrongs make a right? The topic of the book is a worthy subject, but this author does it no justice."
positive,"Awesome collection, but...: This is a GREAT collection of Phillip K. Dick's earliest short stories. Great writing all around. My only complaint is that there is a very repetitive feel as Dick is obsessed with two topics: war, and ""what does 'human' really mean?"" If you don't mind having the same points driven home page after page, it's a winner.J.Ja"
negative,Like a Car Wreck: I shouldn't have looked....but couldn't help myself. Bad acting. Bad story. Not worth the money or the time.
negative,this is WACK it deserves no stars: I would like to know what type of people are writing these reviews and what state of musical knowledge they have i've never written a review but after reading what these plutocrates have wrote i have to respond this cd is on par with Ant and Dec its terrible she waffles on with an annoying high piched voice about english mcs sounding american then she tries to sound like a cracked out missy elliot who also is terrible she has absolutely zero talent and im amazed she has a record deal its borders on treason that shes allowed to hold a mic
positive,great presentation: Very clear instruction and easy to accept; it does not insult the reader. This edition's layout is beautiful (especially the covers). The llustrations are of an unexpected style. They may not add to every reader's experience.
positive,"Not a bad movie: To be honest , I gave it 4 stars but it's more like a 3 1/2 simply because it does have it's good points to it .This film take's us back to the ""later 80's action film ara"" and can be compared to some of Steven Sagals films , or even Dulf Lungren.I just can't get over the fact that it's John Cena in this film (and that's not really a good thing) His acting was OK and the action was good , but it's no ""Condemed"" with Stone Cold !In short , it's OK and that's about it . It will entertain and it isn't a waste of money or time .3 1/2 Stars"
positive,"Stunning Craftmanship: Frankenstein: The Prodigal Son is one of Dean Koontz's best novels. It is fast-paced, full of action and suspense, and the characters are ones you become attached to. Definitely a page turner...I couldn't put it down. Highly recommend this to anyone who loves a suspenseful thriller. Warning: Once you've read this, you'll have to read #2...and if you liked it as much as I did, you'll probably end up angry that #3 isn't out yet. Can't wait!"
negative,"Wish we had done more research--VERY unreliable: It was only AFTER our new B70 Keurig crapped out after working flawlessly for 10 days, that I googled ""keurig doesn't draw water"" and lo and behold found the hundreds of discussions and complaints about this machine. Don't be fooled by the 4 stars shown on Amazon. The thing is deeply flawed and unreliable. Read the 1-star reviews for the real story. Too bad, because when it worked, it was GREAT. It's hard to beat a great cup of coffee in 10 seconds. But it DOESN'T WORK for an awful lot of people, including me, and from the volume of problems out there, it's a poor design and not worth the huge amount of money. Don't waste your money on this item until they have made major reliability improvements."
positive,"Daugharty&#65533;s Finest Literary Work: Meet Doll Baxter: a feisty, full of spunk, spirit, and charm, 17-year-old woman who sets out to save her family's farm and ends up with more than she bargained for. Doll, the title character of Janice Daugharty's latest novel, must deal with her new surroundings at Staten Plantation after she agrees to marry the dashing, daring, and most eligible bachelor Daniel Staten.The skillful Daugharty with her masterful paintbrush pen captures the essence of the rural South in this historical fiction set in South Georgia shortly after ""The War."" The novel captures with breathtaking vitality the young married life of Doll and Daniel Staten, all the while unraveling one of the finest Southern family sagas and creating stunning narrative voices. This novel is Daugharty's finest literary work and sure to be the first of a highly acclaimed trilogy."
negative,"THIS IS A HORRIBLE MOVIE!: My daughter and her friend gave this film a big thumbs down:""We hated it. We were bored out my minds, and couldn't understand the story line at all. The acting was moderate. The only good thing about this movie was that it made us super hungry, since it was 3 hours long!..... At least smear a little spot of dirt on ""angel's"" face by the end.""""So basically, don't watch it.""""Sorry, people. We are very frustrated right now."""
negative,"Dishonesty: I purchased this CD because I enjoyed Lewis Black's ""Rules of Enragement"" so much. However, I was very disappointed at the change in his subject matter. It appears he prostituted himself for the ""Rules"" CD.At Carnegie Hall, for a large Democrat and liberal audience, he only disparages conservatives and Republicans. Hurricane Katrina--he has nothing to say about the Democrat mayor of New Orleans nor the Democrat governor of Louisiana.Gay Marriage--everyone who is Republican is homophobe, not homoaverse.Terry Schiavo-only the Republicans used her for political advantage, while Black relates how he masturbated through this event.However, in ""Rules,"" before a conservative audience, he disparages both sides of the political spectrum, dishonestly protraying himself as a moderate.I really don't care if you are left-wing or right-wing, but if you are going to do political humor, at least you should always be honest about what side of the fence, or on the fence, you are standing."
negative,"Keep this away from Children!: This product was not properly labeled as unsafe for children! I had bought this to power an invention I had picked up at Professor Manglebot's garage sale, but the twins got into the can and now I have two fused three year old boys who keep burning holes into the carpet with their eyes."
negative,"Book is Out of Date for EJB 3.: This book is out-of date. It does not cover EJB 3 which is the current paradigm. For EJB 1 & 2 it is a good book, but these are not used. If you are preparing for SCBCD this is not the book to use"
positive,I can't stop playing it!!!!!!!!!!!: One of the best album's I have ever heard! It tugs at every emotion
positive,"The last Unicorn: The last unicorn video was fantastic, it's about this unicorn that gets captured, needs to leave her animal friends, and she even gets turned into a human. I think there is more than one movie about the last unicorn, but I am talking about a boy that is a wizard (not a very good one), a circus that has lozy animals and a very mean person that image of the animals look like the animals are powerful. If you are a person that enjoys movies about fantasy then READ THIS BOOK!"
negative,"Perfect for people who never intend to use it: Apple makes some of the best computers in the world. Many years ago this was one of them. Today it is an outdated piece of plastic. I bought this computer about four years ago and it was low-end then. I just replaced it because it crawled like a slug. I guess in order to have a ""low priced"" computer Apple figures it can just keep selling it's most out of date systems until people catch on. Oh well, I recognize that like any big company they are in this for the money.The only plus I can give it is size. If you don't want to use a computer and you need to keep it in a small drawer, then this may be what you are looking for."
positive,Good Read!!: Great adventure book. Especially for the younger readers!!! Gary Paulsen has always been the master of wilderness adventure books. Never been disappointed!!
negative,"This book is boring and hard to understand!: Hi! my name is Roy Chan and I am reading this when I'm in 7th grade. I decided to read Great Expectations because I thought it has a lot of excitement. When I read it, it turn out okey but when I'm in Chapter 6 it is boring and hard to understand. So I give it up. Maybe I don't understand this book because I am too young. Maybe I will read this book again in 9th grade."
positive,"Lots of Info - Aimed at Kids: I have very mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, its got a TON of information and is a wonderful reference book. However, its written specifically for teenagers. If it wasn't aimed towards teens, it would be THE BEST book on the market and the CLOSEST THING TO AN ALL-IN-ONE WICCA BOOK that exists.Personally, the kiddy theme is too distracting for me to use regularly (but its still a great reference book). If you are considering buying this, look through it at a bookstore to see if its right for you. Barnes n Noble carries it, and they will order it if they are out of stock and you ask."
negative,"Only Mildly Amusing: I'm a diehard dog lover and I also love books of wit. I appreciate clever photos and good, snippy bogus captions. Nonetheless, I did not find ""Bad Dog"" to live up to its promise. I hate to say it but this book is no ""Bad Cat.""This latter used the natural expressions of felines and some candid photography to really make a witty little coffee table and gift book. ""Bad Dog"" tries to do the same but ultimately fails. It fails because it relies mainly on staged photos of dogs in silly costumes instead of on the natural expressiveness of canine faces and the wide varitey of breeds, not to mention the interesting places dogs end up.Yes, there are some cute costumes and some witty captions here, but on the whole, the book is only mildly amusing. I am afraid that I cannot recommend ""Bad Dog"" as a gift or even for one's own light perusal. If there comes a third volume in this series, we can hope it will be titled ""Bad Editor!"""
negative,"Difficult & Disappointing Product: Very difficult product to adjust & strap onto the trunk of a car.The clips used for attaching to the trunk actually scratched the paint on my car. I do not recommend unless you have a lot of patience to install for each bike ride.On the flip side, it is made of very durable material & is weather resistant."
positive,"Ok ok, so it's in color...: I've been a fan of George A. Romero from a long time, and when I saw the remake of NOTLD by Tom Savini... WOW! Tom is good!OK, the camera angles, and the attitude of all characters are a little bit different, but this version gave me the creeps!The ending is excellent!Watch it!"
positive,One of the best out there: Ok it has all been said about this movie so let me just say this rocks!!!! First it is the real transformers not this beastwars stuff! if you like the old stuff this is the movie for you
positive,"Back To The Egg; Not well known, but worth having.: I received this album Christmas 1979 when it was first released. The overall reviews from critics are not great, but I beg to differ. When I first put the needle on the vinyl I just loved the bass line to ""Reception"". The album in my opinion is a sleeper to the public. At a glance it doesn't contain any known hits, outside of ""Arrow Through Me"" Although, it's filled with great tunes; and ""Rockestra Theme"" is filled with great rockers such as Pete Townshend, David Gilmour, and John Bonham. In my opinion it encompasses McCartney as a rocker and balladeer. I'm definately buying it on CD with the extra tracks."
negative,"ZERO STARS: WHY does this movie get such high reviews. You people are too generous. This movie sucked. I would have loved reading this as a short story but as a movie come on. All it does is GLORIFY sex drugs and violence. Thats all well and good. Just stop pretending this is groundbreaking stuff to think about after its over. Are you thinking of showing this movie to YOUR kids? Is that why you are reading these reviews? If so, you care about your children 100x more than the parents of the characters in this movie ever would...so dont be worried. See what I'm saying? This movie sucks, the acting sucks, the cinematography sucks, it all suck suck sucks ramma lamma ding dong hey."
positive,"Basis - the best makeup remover!: I have used Basis gel for years... not only as a face wash, but as a shower gel and even a shampoo when I am traveling the world. I have skin sensitivities and find that if I use something other than Basis, I get itchy. Basis removes eye makeup beautifully - even waterproof masquera.One note: If you buy in bulk, refridgerate the tubes you are not using, as the product can go bad after a time in warm climates."
positive,"Garmin Nuvi 670: Great GPS! Very impressed with the mapping, routing, re-routing, features, size, etc. Package includes lots of goodies. Contrary to other reviews, there is a built in compass but it is simple, no arrow (N, NE, NW, S, SE, etc.) A few small complaints the same as many other reviewers. Huge oversight the POI's (Favorites) are not put in alphabetical order. Owners manual is not thorough enough- left out a lot of information and capabilities (figure out more by playing w/ GPS than reading manual.) Received my choice of 1 free City NAV software update from Gramin, US or Europe. I don't plan on using the FM transmitter or Bluetooth so have not really evaluated them (It's a GPS not a Swiss army knife). Have not used in Europe yet."
negative,"Rather boring and REALLY cheaply made - Play Forbidden Island instead.: I love playing cooperative board games with my kids, especially games such as Forbidden Island and Castle Panic. Based on the reviews that I had read, Caves & Claws seemed like another fun addition to our family collection. However, once we got the game and tried it a couple of times, it hasn't been played since. The rules are a bit vague on several things, and there was never a true sense of ""Uh-Oh, how are we going to over come this?"" that make good co-op games so much fun to play. Unless you really aren't trying, it seems impossible to lose.Also, the paper tokens feel like they'll tear at any moment, and the game board and cards are poorly printed. There is a small card in the game that explains that the company uses recyclable materials, but that shouldn't be an excuse to make the game feel cheap.There are better options."
negative,"Overwhelmingly Difficult!: When I put in the first disc for Beginning French, I thought I had put in the wrong one. The first CD starts by speaking in full sentences with no English. They speak so quickly and unless one is familiar with the language, you will be lost. Absolutely of NO use if you are trying to listen in your car. I did sit down with the book but the CD does not tell you where on the page it is and they skip around. By the time you find your place, they are somewhere else. I found it to be very frustrating. I have learned Italian pretty well before a trip to Italy, using a different program. But I could not learn French from this program and can not recommend it at all."
positive,Smooth shave best I've found: The higher cost is easily off set by the smoothshave and the logevity so I use less blades and ultimately spen less with fusion blades
positive,"DODGEBALL: I liked everything about this movieYou'll dodge, duck, dip, dive...and laugh out loud watching VINCE VAUGHN and BEN STILLER settle their differences in a winner-take-all dodgeball competition. Under the painful tutelage of legendary ADAA champ PATCHES O'HOULIHAN (RIP TORN), PETTER LAFLEUR (VAUGHN) and his AVERAGE JOES take on the PURPLE COBRAS, keed by egomaniacal fitness guru WHITE GOOMAN (STILLER). It's an over-the-top underdog tale filled with hilarious gags and BALLS-OUT-FUN!"
positive,Changed me: Awesome book. Changed my running style forever. Not a run goes by where I do not think about the techniques in this book.
positive,"A Thesis On Why Anarchy Can Not Work: It is a great book to read for many reasons. The writing is great. It is also a great study on human nature. It is the perfect example on why anarchy can not work. Human nature does not allow a society without hierachy to function. It all falls apart in the end. Also when one reads the book, one can also get a lot of pop culture references to the book like the conch, and piggy. The Simpsons has a funny rendition of the novel as well. The part about where the title is explained is trippy as all hell. Great book. I recommend this to anybody that has not read this book already."
negative,Needs some serious updates: Learning to crochet can be tedious and frustrating. It's hard to be enthusiastic about learning when the patterns you have to work on are for garments you would never ever wear.
positive,"Christian Life Gold: This book is a fantastic look at Romans 5-8, focusing on Christian life issues such as understanding the difference between law and grace, the dangers of legalism, formality and license in the believer's walk, and what it means and looks like to walk in the Spirit. Another great read from a great author. I especially like the author's understanding and presentation of the importance of knowing our identity in Christ and how it relates to everything in our walks with Him."
negative,"one sigma handbook: This book came with six pages of Errata. Even with that, I still found multiple mistakes throughout the book. This book about Six Sigma was written on the one sigma level. I would not recommend this book to anybody. You cannot trust this book!"
positive,"Could've Been Better: I listened to 30 second clips of every song on this CD that this website would let me and I was dissappointed because I REALLY wanted to hear that pretty song on that one car commercial. I really like that song but I don't know what it's called or anything else about ""Moby"" except that he or that band is totally warped and psycotic...Although these charateristics may seem too vile to display the overall effort put into this CD being noticible; I feel that a 5 star rating thoroughly represents the talent and foreward recognition of this wonderful band. Figuratively Speaking"
negative,Poor Quality Products by Rooster LLC: This cell phone holder is one of the poorest in quality I have ever seen. The Velcro or Hook and loop come un-sewn leaving your cell phone free to fall to the ground. I wouldn't recommend McGuire-Nicholas products to anyone. Their products are some of the poorest made products on the market.
positive,For a good cause: In leiu of Christmas Gifts we provided sleeping bags for the organization Helping Hands. The sleeping bags went to individuals that are homeless and need a warm place to sleep. They used these sleeping bags while sleeping in churches that donated their space and time to the homeless during the winter months. The price was great as well as the comfort and warmth of the sleeping bag. Thank you for making it so affordable.
positive,"Pacino and Crowe deliver: ""The Insider"" focuses on Jeffrey Wigand. He is an ex research scientist from the Brown & Williamson tobacco plant. The reason he is fired, is because he finds out that the company has placed some illegal substances in their products.Lowell Bergman, a representative from 60 minutes catches wind of this and wants Jeffrey to give an interview on 60 minutes, describing what wrong Brown & Williamson company have done.Without giving out any more spoilers, I can't say much more about the plot.What makes this film truly an epic film is the wonderful acting by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Pacino gives what is truly an Oscar worthy performance.I highly recommend ""The Insider"" as it is not a simple film by any means, it requires you to think."
negative,"This is a classic??: I had heard this was one of the best horror movies of all time, but my experience was that it was one of the most ridiculous and worst movies I had ever seen. I'd steer clear of this lemon. Ugh!"
negative,"Family Bonds: If you're an adoptee or birthmother, don't waste your money on this narrow-minded view of adoption. Bartholet has little to say about birthmothers! When she does mention birthmothers, she seems to view them as inconsequential baby machines. No empathy in this book!"
negative,"Not very heavy duty: The one I was shipped was junk. It broke the first time I put 25 pounds on it. One of the straps that hangs past the ear tore right off. One of the pictures above shows a guy with two red Olympic plates on the thing. The red plates are 25 Kilos each, that's 110 pounds. Frankly, I wouldn't trust the hardware on this thing with that much weight. It broke in such a way that I can still use mine, and it'll be a good long while before I'm putting 110 pounds on one of these, so I'm going to keep using it. However, if I had it all to do over again I'd trade up for a better one."
negative,"Helps . . . With reservations: This pillow is incredibly helpful for people who have difficulty getting comfortable in bed because it affords a variety of positions to relieve painful areas. But getting in bed can require some simple gymnastic maneuvers because the pillow is so thick and cumbersome. And getting out of bed also requires some special moves, especially if you have a high mattress. Overall, not a simple process for a good nights sleep. The head area also compresses after a few nights of use and rearranging the filling is bothersome. Because it's a considerable investment, I end up using it only occasionally."
positive,"Worked just fine.: I recently used these weights with the underwater case WP-DC31 for my Canon PowerShot SD780 IS. I went on a total of 12 dives with the camera and it seemed perfectly weighted although I never tried the case without the weight to see if there was a difference. I only gave these weights 4 stars because of the difficulty I had figuring out how many weights I should use. The website listed on the documentation was a dead end so I had to search for the proper website. I found it at the bottom of the following page (take out the spaces): [...] According to the website, my camera only required one weight. I read previous reviews so I put some pipe thread tape on the screw and the weight stayed secure through all 12 dives."
negative,"I only gave it a 1 'cause there isn't a lower Rating!: Hi everyone! I had to read this book for school and it was torture. I would not ever reccommend this book to anyone. It was soo boring! Mark Twain tried to be funny, but he was not! The chapters droned on and on about boring topics. This is not a lie at all: I fell asleep with the book open on my lap!"
positive,"Great Ideas with some entertaining philosophy: I highly recommend this book. The techniques in the book really do work, no matter what one thinks about the philosophy behind it. I'm 23 and have been running regularly for about 12 years, though only semi-competitively for about a year. In my sophomore year in college, I was training for the possibility of going into OCS and ended up overtraining. I suffered a relatively serious stress fracture by doing the things that the author of this book warns against. I recently completed a marathon using the techniques in this book, and was amazed at the improvement in my time, and the way my body felt after the race. These techniques are solid, especially for experienced runners looking to improve their distances/times. The Eastern philosophy sprinkled throughout the book is entertaining and, as with all philosophy, good brain candy to chew on."
positive,"Very detailed, but well indexed reference: Everything you wanted to know (and probably didn't care to know) about linux.The only drawback are some of the builtin functions that he uses. These are usually uppercase modifications of the lower case functions. It creates one more step for the reader, if they don't want to use his builtin functions."
negative,"High Concept Marketing - Low Flow: I was hella disappointed. I thought this would be a cool CD from the cover, but basically there is no feeling in the production. Whoever put this together went low budget & is counting on the cover to sell some discs. Your basic new school junk, plus there are NO FAT TRACKS. What Spanish it has is just buzz word BS representing. If you want GOOD Rap in Spanish check Orishas - A Lo Cubano, Molotov, Control Machete - Artilleria Pesada...Presente or one of the many other rappers who do it better."
positive,"Cool!: 4 stars for now, haven't used it, as it is a gift for my uncle. Packaging was nice, shipped on time, and no damage from what I can see. Will update review once my uncle uses it."
negative,"Fareed rules, but this selection is poor.: The 1 star is for the poor selection.I am a big fan of Fareed Alatrash and have every song he has on cassettee or cd. I can categorically state thatthis cd is an awful selection that is totally unrepresentative of Fareed. Keep in mind that one cd can't possibly do justice to a genious with his depth and breadth. The selection probably has more to do with what EMI could get publishing rights for than anything else. With that said, tracks 1 and 5 are better than the other three. An excellent variety is available from specialized websites like maqam dot com (maqam.com) where I got all my cd's. There are also dedicated farid-el-atrache websites."
negative,"hOT sPACE rEVIEW: There is very little to recommend this album to anyone other than a true die-hard Queen fan. It is laborous and disconnected. The ""hits"" that came from it are good but not plentiful enough to justify the completed work"
negative,"Extremely POOR reproduction quality for ""HD"" Movie: It's a very interesting movie and since I was involved with a large, close knit Italian family for several years, there were many parallels to real life based on my experience...not a bad thing at all. Very enjoyable.On the rental: In addition to having to restart the movie 2 times, the supposed amazon's HD version of the movie is such poor quality it looked like an old VHR quality so that was very disappointing to watch a blurry picture. I did register a complaint though I doubt there will be a change to this particular offering based on the response I received.This was my first and last movie rental from Amazon."
negative,"lectures on philosophy discussing micro differences in terminology with little practical value: Cons: boring, pointless, pages of discussion with no practical value; author does not offer his concepts, just criticism of othersPros: helps to fall asleep,"
negative,"A very difficult text book to learn anything from: I get the impression that the reader from NH is the only reviewer to have tried to solve some of the problems in this book. There is no possible way to solve these problems. They are on subjects and situations not covered in the book, and even if they were, good luck in understanding Bejan's writing. He skips massive steps, giving only solutions and equations without explanations. Not everyone like reviewer Jeff Booth was born understanding convective heat transfer, so some of us must learn from books. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one. I only hope that Dr. Bejan reads these reviews and that they discourage him from making another failed attempt at text book writing."
negative,"Trite, simple, unimaginative: What more can I say? The Mule? Give me a break. How can anyone consider this to be great fiction? Go read something else...."
positive,"Every Mom needs one of these!!!: This is the best crib toy I have ever found. It has an on/off switch, PLUS a volume control. The music is soothing and melodious, (not loud & obnoxious like toys we have). The lights start out low, then brighten, and the sounds start out soft and get louder. This is great, as it doesn't startle baby out of her bed, plus, it doesn't abruptly shut off and wake baby when it is finished. You can set the music and lights OR one or the other. This was made with Mom's in mind!!The perfect shower gift!"
negative,Pass on it: My baby didn't get much use out of these. They're sort of too small to care. I would pass on this item next time.
positive,It worked great: I am glad I bought it. It was affordable and worked very well. It was easy to figure out how to use. I highly recommend this tool.
negative,"Get's Really Old...: I enjoyed this game, for the first HOUR and a half... Then I got really tired of just cleaning up dung, and having people NOT go to some exhibits. It doesn't have a very friendly interface. THe only thing I enjoyed was letting the cages break, and having the animals 'chase' the people.Saddly, thatwas the funnest part."
negative,"Pretentious intellectual self-absorption: I was tempted to write this review after reading the other reviews. It seems that most readers had to struggle through it or use Cliff Notes. In short, it seems many succumbed to the peer pressure that it was a ""great"" book and that they just ""had"" to read it. It puts me in mind of someone going to an art gallery full of atrocious modern art and faking that they liked it to show how sophisticated they are. The truth is this book stinks.For one thing it is vulgar, which, I hate to disappoint anyone, requires no talent at all. This is a talent any six year-old boy possesses. Is the wordplay clever? Yes, too clever. James Joyce must have been incredibly pleased with himself.(...)himself."
positive,"Great Size and Easy 2 clean: Works great, good quality and the best part its east to clean. Holds the temp pretty good and the handle is very comfortable. Right size 2 make 2 cups."
negative,Bad audio experience with Kindle on iPad: I ordered this thinking I could listen to the story on the Kindle iPad. There is audio but there is no progress bar. Thus you must start at the beginning and listen to the full story. There is no way to jump to anywhere in the audio. L-ame. The kids and I got bored with the introduction of the author and I went back to reading it outloud.
positive,"where it all began: while this isn't my favorite Firewind CD it's a nice listen, not as deep as later CDs by any means, and there's nothing seperating this one from any other power metal bands, but it's an enjoyable listen. as it's a rerelease you get some of the demo songs they submited, and this really give you the feel of a band starting out."
positive,"A Touching, Soul-Searching Novel: I recently got done reading this wonderful, yet forgotten novel of Lawrence's. Truly compelling in it's intricate details of a young woman trying to find herself. Literally. She goes on the 'universal' self journey and discovers that she was lost and finally finds her identity and sensuality in the man she loves. D.H. Lawrence has a wonderful way of not wrapping up the ending in a nice,neat little package. As always, Lawrence is the ultimate man of mystery, sensual needs and desires. A ""must read"" for those who love to read Lawrence and for those who never have!"
negative,Upgrade computer: If you have a new computer or maybe newer that 2003 this cable will work if you are working with one older than that like me it doesn't work. So now I have this wonderful cable and waiting to get an upgraded computer to match.
positive,"If you don't have this, get it!: This book is a wonderful illustration of the simple (so simple they go unnoticed) principles of a market economy and the many fallacies of adding socialism to the mix.I could have easily given this 4.5 stars, but I didn't have the option. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 was that Hazlitt partially caves in about halfway through the book on the topic of unions. Unions are tantamount to coersion and have no place in a market economy."
negative,Very disappointed: I have little luck with this seed and am very disappointed. I have tried several batches and get 10-15% yield from them. I do not know if the is old seed or what the problem is. Wheatgrass will usually grow no matter what so I gotta believe the seed is not optimal. Very expensive waste of time and money for me = (
positive,Favorite: This is one of my Favorite Animes. I had a copy before I bought this one. I got rid of it to make more room on my movie shelf.
negative,Do not buy this!: I saw this on amazon and decided to get it for my dad for Christmas. Big mistake! It broke right away and takes 5 minutes of shaking for about 5 seconds of light. I'm not kidding! I read the reviews but I thought my dad would really like it so bought it anyway. Trust me: Do not buy this! You will regret it.
positive,"Clay is so special: There is something very, very special about Clay. I get chills when I listen to him sing. I can't remember the last time anyone's voice made me feel like that. I just can't get enough of him. This cd is outstanding! I love all the songs. I especially like ""I Survived You"". I find it hard to get through the cd as I keep replaying each song. I do wish they would have put ""Solitaire"" on this cd, but maybe the next one. I'd also love to see Neil Sedaka write and produce the next one. Clay, you're awesome, the cd is awesome! We love you!!!"
negative,"You've got to be kidding me!: Well, let's not mince words here, but I thought it was a horrible movie. Being an Air Force veteran, I like movies with planes, old and new, but I have to tell you this wasn't one of them. Acting was poor for the most part, historical aspects, well they get a grade of F-, including the planes, and supposed time period. All wrong. I usually like to watch a movie, and enjoy it, without analyzing it, but this one was different, and I could not help myself. I kept hoping it might get better, but no luck. So, Nothing ventured, Nothing gained, and I would not recommend this film to anyone! Period! Adios!"
positive,"So You Wanna Be a Comic Book Artist: This book takes you all the way from inspiration thru getting your meterial out there to be evaluated. Chapters include: starting a studio, tools of the trade, illustration tips and tricks, creating the characters, creating the story line/scripts, putting it all together, copy-shop comics, promotion and getting publicity for your work, submitting your comics to publishers, video game designing, sources and essential comic book terminology. The book is a complete source for anyone interested in pursuing the field, old or young--anyone."
positive,"herout shines: damn! this band was a hot machine from the late '90s of the near northside of chicago. jim herout is a very stong drummer, and very much willing to take a risk. as a stong musician, he's the greatest unsigned drummer in north america. jim is psychadelic, brainy and fun. herout belongs with a tuff scene like american analog set. jim is a close friend of the neo-beat, paul brittain."
negative,Very Disappointed: I adore the first two movies. I began watching this movie and was so totally bored and disappointed...I never finished it. To make this short and sweet...I do not recommend this movie.
negative,"Not too good: There are a few nice tracks on this album but it was largely a disappointing experience. It seems like most of the tracks were experiments by the artists in their own styles, styles remote from that originally intended by Porter."
positive,An excellent story of children who use their wits to survive: In 1963 my 6th grade teacher read a chapter from this book to our class every day. We were completely engrossed in the story of these children and the sad adventure that they were forced to take in a world gone mad. Their childhood was lost at an early age but they managed to use their good sense and family loyalty to survive. I have recommended this book to other children who have also come to love it. I am happy to see it become available again after being out of print so long.
negative,"Strange fit, sent it right back: I bought this item, along with the Squeem Miracle vest. I tried putting this on and it was so odd, I can't imagine anyone actually wearing it. I am 5'4"" and weigh 128. I usually wear a size 6. I ordered the medium size. I put it on and the abdominal area was really tight. However, the crotch area gapped really badly and when I fastened the thighs, they hung loosely. Now, I have saddle bags and my thighs are one of my biggest problem areas. But this was actually way too big to do anything for my thighs, compounded by the gapping crotch. I had great luck with the miracle vest and will be writing a review on that item."
positive,"Couldn't put it down: This was a great book that brings the Bible and it's characters to life. If you want to gain a deeper knowledge of King Hezekiah and his life, you must read this book. The scriptures inspire, the story brings courage and hope of God's love, forgiveness, and restoration that He is true to his Word."
positive,bad ass: i really loved this movie have not seen it since i was a kid i really enjoyed seeing it again
negative,Terrible: I Couldn't even get past page 60. This is just a copy of other fantasy books. A place called Gilead: Dark tower??? Author must get his own ideas
positive,"Doo Wop Be Bop: I gave this CD set as a gift. I can honestly say, one can never hear this music to much, because the person I gave this to listens to it just about every day. She cleans her house by it, she takes them on long drives. I asked to her to describe this set in one word. ""Fantastic"". Even her son listens to it, and enjoys it. If I could give a higher rating than 5 stars this CD would have it. She says it is the best compilation she has ever heard."
negative,"quite boring...: I've been a fan of Ry Cooder's recordings for a long time, but noe I prefer him more like producer of other artist's records (listen to the latest M. Staples one..). ""My name is Buddy"" should be changed in ""My name is BORING"": I can save only 4/5 good songs (NOT masterpieces) in this cd, the sound is disjointed and the voice of Ry seems is really too tired...Finally, listening to the latest Ry's album, my favourite remains Chavez Ravine, that is strange and not perfect, but much better than Buddy!"
positive,"A watershed recording: A watershed recording, and the first as a leader by Metheny. And the amazing thing is that some of these tunes were actually exercises that Metheny wrote for his Berklee jazz guitar students, after he segued from student to instructor."
positive,Fun: This game is a lot of fun. I also have The Sim's Expansion Collection Volume 3: Vacation & Superstar so this was a great addition.
negative,"Not Happy: I used the bed 3 nights and it started leaking on the fouth night. I contacted the seller and was told to find the leak. If it was in a seam it was under warranty. I tried to find the leak, but was unable. I emailed them back to ask the best way to find the leak. I received NO response.I did a little reasearch on the web and found MANY people had a problem with this bed.So I am unable to find the leak and unable to use the bed.I an not Happy with the company I purchased if from and will not recommend them to anyone!"
negative,"Who mixed this thing??: I was really looking forward to this one. As a fan of the Classic Album Series, I was very disappointed when I watched this one. The volume level is very inconsistent, especially during the sections where people are talking over the music. You have to turn it way up when they're talking, then be quick with the remote when the music starts or it will blow your speakers! For die-hard fans only, and keep the volume remote handy. You'll need it!"
negative,"love the book, hate the way the text is organised: When I saw that this was the preferred edition for kindle I presumed that the text would be organised in a way to fit the kindle comfortably. Instead I found that the text does not uniformly fill the page. It is written as a full line follwed by a half line. I had to increase the font size in order to make it slightly less annoying. One thing it taught me is to ALWAYS download the sample chapter first before purchasing and don't presume that 'kindle preferred' means you'll be getting the best one for the kindle. Of course the book itself is brilliant."
positive,"GREAT READ! EXCELLENT STORYLINE! HOT TOPIC!: KIMBERLA LAWSON ROBY HAS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE SCINCE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS! THIS TIME SHE EXAMINES A ALL TO FAMILIAR TOPICS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. RELIGION, POWER, GREED, & LUST. THE CHARACTERS ARE GREAT AND I EMPATHISE WITH THE PASTOR'S WIFE. YOU ALSO GET A INSIDE LOOK AT THE PASTOR AND WHAT DROVE HIM TO HIS DEMISE. IF YOU HAVEN'T READ HERE & NOW OR BEHIND CLOSED DOORS YOU ARE MISSING GREAT READS FROM ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED AFRICAN AMERICAN WRITERS TODAY ! ALWAYS GIVING YOU SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT. KEEP EM COMING MRS ROBY I WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR #1 FAN!"
negative,"That was a sequal?: I do have to admit that I enjoyed the first Mummy very much, but I was extremely disappointed in this sequal. It almost completely changes the character development from the first one and the special effects will have you rolling in the isles (quite frankly, I could have done better with an action figure and my home video camera.) Worth seeing once, but there was nothing original about this movie."
negative,"Not worth it: A lot of work clearly went into this book, but not a lot of information. If you're looking for info, some of the web references are the wrong addresses, the book is about 220 pages (double spaced) with about 100 pages that are reprints of ""checklists"" - i.e., does your child prefer to be warm or cool when studying? There are references to other people's work (admittedly there's not a lot out there) but it seems only anecdotal original work, most of which is repeated numerous times and is generally the same girl identical twins. For those of you out there looking for answers, they're not in this book."
positive,Brings it together: I love these wall hangings. It adds a little extra to help bring the room together.
negative,"need extra lubrication: The price of these condoms combined with the speed of the shipping are the only reasons this product received two stars. The reviews stating that these condoms feel like nothing are overexagerating. These condoms fit too snugly and feel like a raincoat. Additionally, the condoms are lightly lubricated so that if you last more than 5 minutes you have to stop and apply more lubrication. This can ruin the atmosphere and sometimes the mood. Anyways I will be keeping the last six of these condoms for emergencies and my gf and I will keep searching for the perfect condom."
negative,"Stant 10834: Does not fit 1999 Miata as described, cannot close the gas lid without damaging it, the flange on the cap is too tall?"
negative,"One of his worst...: I am surprised to see so many positive reviews here. The books started off wonderfully, with an interesting protagonist and fabulous details of life in a small town in the 70s. The murder and subsequent trial was also great, and the suspense that this all set up was good too.Then, the story pretty much stopped moving. Grisham got into painful details - scenes that had almost nothing (and I'm being generous) to do with moving the plot. I kept reading because I couldn't imagine he could do this... it had to pick up again somewhere, didn't it?Sadly, no. The last few pages got back into the drama, but the story ended with a neat excuse for real closure. Too simple, too convenient.Someone described this book as ""literary."" I don't see it, sorry. Grisham is one hell of a story-teller. He's got a great imagination. I imagine this is one of those books that ""by contract"" had to be finished according to some publisher's schedule. Too bad."
negative,"Mr.Average: and that is a reach.this Album has Easily His Best Music to date on it but the Cat can't Sing to Me&nothing every seems to change.now He is One Lucky Cat with all the Tribute Shows&Projects He gets to be down with.but as far as Being an Elite Artist?Don't Believe the Hype.thsi Album He is trying to tap into R.Kelly,D'angelo&Maxwell's World&Come up way short."
positive,"Excellent! Couldn't put it down..: I'm an avid fan of biblical historical fiction...I love the way she brings this story to life and keeps you in suspense. Details are clear and accurate....beyond that, you're drawn immediately into the story, the character's thoughts/emotions/motivations/lives, and hoping they choose to follow God. My biggest acclaim for a book in this genre is having read it that i find myself loving my God even more, seeking harder after Him, understanding just a little more, and wanting more of Him! My faith is encouraged! Definitely recommend!"
negative,"Check Boettner's Sources: This is an ill researched and prejudiced account of the Catholic faith. Many accusations, lies, and half-truths are jumbled together to try to shine a negative light on Catholicism."
positive,"Loved it!!: Kit Tyler has to leave her beloved Barbados. She leaves to live with her aunt and uncle. She wonders if she'll ever fit in. Meeting the lady by blackbird pond whom everyone believes is a witch makes her feel better about herself, and visits her as often as possible.But soon she puts another in danger. Could this put her in danger as well?I would highly recommend this book. This thrilling novel makes you want to read it all at once. Full of action,love and some rebellion, not only has it won a Newberry Medal but also it captivates the imagination."
negative,"Exam Master. for the USMLE Step 2: I hate this CD , it was waste of money and I wish I could refund my money ( 89 USD + S&H, I bough it directly from the publisher) I am absolutly agree with the rest of the reviewers. questions are not even close to USMLE step 2 format. whoever wrote those questions I am sure that had no idea about USMLE at all since the questions are about any thing but USMLE step 2. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS CD 7 insted try to read NMS REVIEW multiple Q ( it is bible of USMLE step 2 )."
negative,Kindle edition has Black and white images?!: I've seen printed versions of this book and I've been thinking about getting it for a while. Never in my wildest dreams did I think the kindle version would be in black and white. When discussong color and showing diagrams showing the actual colors really helps. I am soo soo disappointed with this purchase. The books content itself is amazing but I'm going to rethink ordering ebooks from amazon in the future.
negative,"Not ready yet: I am very disappointed im this product so far. I have all DLind equipment, and it recognized my network perfectly. However, it has lots of other problems and badly needs a firmware upgrade. It has frozen several times, requiring that I unplug it to restart. It occassionally stops in the middle of a song. Most disappointing is that it cannot seem to read artist or album info on most of my music (mp3 or wma), and cannot play more than one song at a time. I called tech support and they told me that is the best the server can do right now (contrary to adverstisments and the manual). The shuffle and repeat buttons never work. Wait til they fix all this before you buy, this is an awful failure so far."
positive,"2nd only to lord of the rings: If you have read any of my other reviews, you will notice that I'm a big fan of Gemmels. I love all his books, but none (except this one) have I ever rated 5 star. The characters are fantastic and I even became mournful when ever one of them died. In most novel I'm able to pick out a favourite character right from the begining, but in this story I could not decide who I liked the most.The demons are brilliantly contrasted from one another and I love the way all the odds are stacked against the goodies. You really feel that there is no way out for them, and I can promise that you will never predict the ending.This is a Drenai book, yet it is seperate from the Nadir war story line. So you don't have to read it in link with the others. Simply put: this is one of the best stories you'll ever come across."
positive,"A beautifully written novel: I just finished Cannery Row and I loved it. I didn't care that the book didn't seemingly have a ""plot"". The characters were so realistic and such good people that I immediately fell in love with them. By the end of the book, I thought of each character as some sort of saint rather than the bum or hooker that they ""really"" were. Steinbeck gives the reader an intimate view into this community that he knows so well. I thought of Cannery Row as a sort of paradise where the ideals that are truly important prevail. Even besides all this, I thought that the writing was just so eloquent. I enjoyed reading about these characters that would be overlooked in real life because of the way that they live."
negative,"You get what you pay for: I normally don't go discount, but decided to try this case...but its disappointing. The foam compression is such that my Ruger Mark III Competition and my Ed Brown .45 will not stay in place inside the case and move around inside. That makes the case all but worthless as a gun tote to the range. I gave it to my son for his paintball gear and am buying Pelican with plunk n' pick foam instead. This case is very basic, and offers only marginal protection. Skip it if you have nice firearms."
positive,Good movie: Enjoyed the movie but the 3d was not that great. The remakes in 3d do not seem to be very impressive.
positive,"Must for Buffy fans!: This collection episodes is great for Buffy fans, or people who have no idea what Buffy is. This video is what the show is all about. Humor, drama, sorrow, love, friendship, etc. is all in these two episodes. ""Angel"" describes the relationship between Buffy and Angel, and gives viewers a look into his life. ""The Puppet Show"" may give off a creepy vibe, but it's one of the episodes I laugh at everytime I watch it, it's so funny. If you haven't seen these episodes, or even if you have, you should get this video!"
negative,Size of Bible was not listed on Amazon: The size of the Bible was not advertised with the product. I thought I was purchasing a larger size like the customer showed me she wanted. I did get permission to return them to the seller.
negative,"Have not received my item in a month.: My order was placed on August 28, but I have not received the printer in a month."
positive,"The Essential Gunfighter album.: I remember these songs as a boy. REAL western music. They really hold up well, today! What a voice! And some really cool story-telling lyrics."
negative,"Pop psychology crap: I was required to read this book for a promotional test for my work. This book is chalked full of clunky metaphors, over generalizations, and pedantic bullsh**. It is worthless for anyone who is not retarded."
positive,"Awesome book for fully understanding the Marvel Universe: This is one of the best superheroe books ive ever read, very well explained and pictured, recomend it to every Marvel fan."
positive,A Fascinating Book: The most fascinating thing about this book is how little things change. The South Sea Bubble episode which happened almost three hundred years ago is eerily similar to the whole internet stock market scene today. Will we ever learn ? One of the most interesting and thought provoking books I have read recently.
negative,"This movie was awful!: The acting was horrible! I don't see how any young hooligan would ever want to see such a blasphemous ""movie!"" If I made a movie I would make it a beautiful love story! That's the only kind of movie that should be made anyway!- Miss Gardenheimer"
positive,"The rice, it is nice: A cheerful little product. Well made, well priced, and well cooked. Cleaning is easy, and the cord storage is wonderful (automatic retracting power cords should be a law for all small appliances). I haven't had any troubles of any kind."
positive,"Brilliant: Modern technology may dwarf this film to a certain degree; however this pre-digital era film still stands against those of today. Especially when you consider the amount of work that went into it. The bonus features is worth the purchase alone, however Roger Rabbit is a classic in my opinion with strong characters, acting and plot. I did see it in the theatre and at a young age so my opinion is bias perhaps. I'm looking forward to seeing my niece's reaction and one day my own children's."
negative,"Gabriel's weakest album: I'm a Gabriel fanatic. I truly believe he is one of rock music's most gifted artists.Now for the bad news: PG was still searching for his own voice on this second solo effort, and hadn't yet found it. Although II is stylistically more cohesive than the first album, the production by Robert Fripp seems misguided at best, a muddy mess at worst. PG(I) was fun, II is dreary and grating.Maybe the scratching finger nails on the cover was Gabriel's response after listening to the end result!"
positive,"This is a comprehensive list of the earlier photographic patents.: This a comprehensive list of the earlier photographic patents. There is so much information within these pages. These patents have been meticulously researched by it's author, who is also a professor at a well known university. (She has also recently completed another book on American tintypes, published by the American Philosophical Society.) I don't understand why the first reviewer panned the book. It is what the title says it is, but maybe it wasn't what he expected."
positive,"Very Sweet: I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn when I was about 12 years old, and have had reason to return to it as an adult. I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it. The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different, and interesting effect on the reader. Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in Brooklyn in 1912. Although her life is a constant struggle for money, she still manages to eke out much joy. The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life. While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never, ever gave up, never gave in to defeatism. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and a sweet story, squeaky clean, one which both young teens, and their parents should enjoy."
positive,Great game for toddlers: This was a great game for children. My toddler nephew who loves Caillou loved this game and it was one that he was able to play lone without very much adult supervision.
positive,"using this for 10 years: i got this face soap in the little box of goodies they give you when you move into your college dorm freshman year. i've been using it ever since. i think it keeps my face feeling fresh and clean and i rarely ever break out. on occasion i do buy a different face soap to mix it up for a few days, but i always come back to this. its not always easy to find in the stores, so it's great that amazon has it available. i will be using this facewash for years to come."
negative,"Long winded any one: When I was a little kid, I started and read this book, and I found it quite good, then I read decent fantasy novels. This book is so immensity long winded that if you cut it down to important details, it would have been maybe thirty pages. In addition to having a paper thin plot that anyone could guess the ""twists"" the author blatantly rips off other authors and works as opposed to creating his own ideas. The ancient language is Latin and dwarves speak german! Urgales are simply orcs. All of the characters are shallow and make nothing but one terrible decision after another. Also, the magic users in this book are super weak and whinny ""oh, I can't heal him easily, it a paper cut, better draw on my magic reserves!"" seriously, this book is nearly as bad as Harry Potter. Don't waste your time on this book if you can read above a third grade level."
negative,Waste of life.: this movie has not only a horrible story but has NO smiths/morrissey music at all and the guy who plays moz doesnt even look much like him even though they cover his face in shadows. the longer i watched this movie the more i though how much of a waste it is to watch/buy/think about...anything! it sucked! don't buy it. dont even bother seeing it. believe me.
negative,"B.O.R.I.N.G.: This was the most awfully boring book I've ever read! It was for a discussion group or I wouldn't have read most of it. Had no idea it was a classic, but now wonder what made it so. All of our discussion group thought the same thing!"
positive,"A VERY POWERFUL STORY AND FILM: I used to watch this movie all the time when I was little and love it. It has remained one of my favorite movies through out my life and always well be. It is a very powerful true story, the acting is excellent and it has a lot of emotion. It is a film that I recommend highly. A very beautiful story that will cause to fall in love with Elsa, the lioness. Definitely a film to see."
negative,"What a fantasy: I could never seem to get into this book; why? It is a tale of 'Bilbo Baggins' and his journey with Gandalf and the dwarves to find treasure, and defeat the 'evil dragon', Smaug. It seems pointless; adventure after adventure, many characters, and no main theme. It was a childish and boring book (as well a series)."
negative,"Do not use this edition of Middlemarch: This review is of the 2011 edition published by Simon & Brown. I got this edition from Amazon and was completely shocked at the atrocious editing. There are numerous typos and transpositions, so numerous and egregious that they are completely distracting and make the book unreadable. Furthermore, the chapter headings are completely mangled. Eliot began each chapter with a quotation or poem, or piece of a poem (many of which she wrote herself), and in this edition, the lines of poetry are all run together so you don't even know it's a poem! I ask you! Avoid, avoid, avoid. Wonderful novel, read it in ANY OTHER edition. Edition to avoid is:Middlemarch"
negative,"A old fashioned sci-fi story!: When I read this book I was only twenty years old. In general, I think that the plot line and characterizations aren't so good, but the story has a certain charm and style that resemble some old sci-fi classics of the 30's, like Flash Gordon and The Red Purple Monster. That is the most positive point of the book; but Anderson did other better works, like, for example, Tau Zero and Unlimited Orbit."
positive,"A harrowing 19th disaster story: Philbrick's book reads a lot like Sebastian Junger's ""The Perfect Storm."" Like Junger, he details life in a fishing community and documents a seafaring trajedy that shook the town. Similar to Junger's description of drowning, Philbrick provides a graphic description of death by dehydration to emphasize what the fishermen were experiencing as they drifted for three months in open whaleboats on the vast Pacific Ocean. The main difference between Philbrick's account and Jungers is that some of Philbrick's fisherman lived to tell the tale. Philbrick is an excellent storyteller who brings his subject alive. Anyone with an interest in either the sea or a good adventure story will love this book."
positive,"Good game, but not perfect: I thought that this game was actully pretty good, and it is addicting and fun. however, i have one complaint. the AI of the guests is TERRIBLE! when they are reallly really hungry, thirsty,tired,have to go to the b-room, etc, they walk RIGHT BY the things that would make it all better. this needs to be fixed in a patch or something."
positive,"MORE THAN LETTERS...: I admit that I bought this album for the title track alone. After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME. Montgomery's smoother-than-silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight-forward approach to his music comes through in every note. You won't want to miss this one.THE HORSEMAN"
positive,dont order from these guys: I havent recieved it yet these guys suck it was going to be a christmas present for a friend and i dont even got it yet why does it take a month to get a movie in the mail
positive,"Wonderful and soothing: This product is just wonderful. We were very happy when we brought it home and started it up. We jokingly said that if our son didn't like it, we would take it for our room, it was so soothing.My son loves the different songs and sounds from this. It is one of the few things that I can have playing while getting him down to sleep. He loves the sound of it. When he wakes up in the middle of the night, he can start it up himself and it helps him fall back to sleep.There are two buttons to ""play"" with but they really do not do that much but that is okay to me. I do not want this to be so busy that instead of going to sleep he would want to play with it all the time, which is what happened with our other mobile which we had to take down once he started standing.Our son is 9 months old now and we have really enjoyed this product since we got it for him at 5 months."
negative,"average filler Album: Neil Young is a Talented Songwriter&Musician,but he has a tendency to release alot of so-so Projects from time to time&this is no exception. the lyrical Content&the overall Musical Feel here is very much on the safe territory that Eric Clapton long ago settled for.it can work for some artists,but it makes some others seem in need of trying to just release whatever as soon as Possible.very run of the mill Album here."
negative,"Broke after a couple of months.: I am a gentle user, so I don't know why this product broke. I wish I could send it back, but it is probably too late."
positive,"Awesome, you idiots!: I think that this series was awesome. You guys are idiots to say it was bad! I mean, sure it was kind of sad, but that's what makes an epic book!So, if you're reading this and you haven't read the book...YOU BETTER READ THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"Smooth, Smokey Getz: This smooth, smokey Stan Getz collection puts all of his great, evocative style on display. There is no doubt that this CD was put together with romance in mind: each track conjures up a sultry, late-night mood. One of my favorites is the title track which begins the collection. This is Getz at his soulful, sexy best."
negative,"Close but no cigar...: FINE...I admit it. It's a decent book. I have some squirmishes with the editing, but all in all, the story itself isn't bad. That isn't to say, of course, that the book is downright amazing. In fact, far from it. Paolini is hopelessly derivative of older and far better fantasy novels (Lord of the Rings anyone?) That isn't the major problem because a lot of fantasy novelists have done that, but the best and most successful of them (J.K Rowling for example) have at least used these old ideas and made them new and interesting. Paolini does not. The bottom line is: if you've never read a fantasy novel, you'll love it. If you have, then don't bother. There's nothing new."
positive,"A very good how-to manual.: If you are expecting a book full of glossy sharp pictures, this is not the one to buy.A lot of drawings and BW pictures that inform what they need to. This is a very good manual for those who want to venture in a timber frame project."
positive,"A must read, regardless of worldview: Even though this book is not perfect, it has more than enough philosophical and historical value to qualify as a must read.The one thing that bothered me about the book is that Paine lets anger get in the way and it shows through in some of his weaker arguments and ad hom attacks. That aspect robbes him of some credibility, which is a shame because this book should be read and talked about.One of the most striking aspects of the book is not in the book itself but a reflection on it. Anyone who is exposed to Christianity in America is made aware of heroes of the faith who have accepted persecution and even death because they spoke out for Christianity. Well, here's a Deist who literally risked his life by writing this book. Did he do it for a heavenly reward? Apparently not because he wasn't sure that there was a heaven. He did it because of principles."
positive,"The Egyptian is both enchanting and inspirational.: Reading and re-reading this historical novel, and turning people on to it over the years, has multiplied my own delight. Ancient Egypt LIVES through Waltari's unforgettable characters. A wonderful book."
positive,"Very successful: It was just pure coincidence that I re-watched LA Confidential two days before I watched The Insider. Maybe that was the reason why I was too focused on Russell Crowe's performance. It was amazing! The film was a parade of outstanding performances including, Christopher Plummer.Mainly I enjoyed every minute, catching up the details of the performances of the actors, with the beauty of the soundtrack and the strength of the script. I even liked the slow motion effects. This is one of the best films I've seen in the past year.I still smoke though..."
negative,Does not work in the US: Totally bummed! My DVD doesn't work! I bought it as a gift but it was a waste of money since I'm in the US.
negative,"Not satisfied: I wouldn't buy this printer again. I have had it about 2 years. I get paper jams but that's not the worse thing. The ""OK"" button stopped working. So when I get a paper jam, I have to shut the printer off and then back on. Also when I put new print cartridges in, I can't use the OK button so I have the message on the LCD to ""Align the cartridge"".It does print nice pictures.Anyway, I have had several HP printers, they are usually great products. This is the worse printer I have ever had."
positive,"Trailer Hitch Went in W/Out a Hitch (LOL): This was sent to me very quickly and with Super Saving Shipping - to my suprise it also had the tongue or reciever and the reciever pin and clevis pin, I thought I was going to have to buy one but it was in there, as a kit, I did supply my own reciever BALL. All the hardware was in packaging as well as the instructions. The install went in ""W/OUT A HITCH""(No Problems that is)- my wife gave me a quick hand so when I was holding the hitch frame up under the car she dropped in the bolts through the plates/brackets. Took about 1hr 15 min from start to finish(wiring took and additional 45 min). I installed the Ball on the new reciever did the wiring and Bamm all done. I highly recommend this to anyone needing this Hitch for light duty hauling - Ease of install on scale of 1-10 = 2 very easy to do."
negative,"Totally trashed my skin!: I bought this at Ulta after doing some research regarding chemical peels helping acne, and one of the sales associates recommended this product. My acne has always been pretty mild, but I wanted to see if I could get it under control better. My skin is extremely delicate. My skin actually felt great for the first few days of using this product -- balanced out my skin tone very nicely. Perhaps I should've stopped there, as after a week I broke out with HORRIBLE deep, cystic, painful acne that took me weeks to get over. The scars/pock marks they left behind were even worse. I would be wary if you have sensitive skin. Fortunately, the folks at Ulta remembered me from a few weeks prior and refunded my money. Sadly, I did almost no explaining as my face told the whole story."
positive,"GREAT BOOK: I thought that the Count of Monte Cristo was a fabulous book! It is about deceit and revenge aswell as love which is a great mix!Edmond Dantes is deceived by four ""friends"" and prisoned on a desolate island in the dreaded Chateau D'if. Together with the Priest Faria they devise a plan for his escape and Edmond sets forth to seek revenge.There is so much suspense I could hardly put down the book.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!"
negative,"Poor Quality: This cable worked for 2 days, then quit. Save yourself the hassle and buy a better quality cable the first time. It seems that you get what you pay for; don't go cheap!"
negative,"huh?: While I liked following the new perspectives of an old favorite, it seemed like Tennant was trying too hard to write as a classic. I was often confused by what she was writing. The wording/descriptions were awkward, difficult to follow, and not completely confident (or competent)."
negative,"Intriging but not great.: The author apparently had 17 and 18 year olds in mind when she wrote this book. Filled with sex and profanity, Shadow is exciting, disturbing, and not that great. Joyce Sweeney has a nack for suspence but absolutely no taste."
negative,"It Works, However....: Installed this and two new drives and was quite happy with the new disk space available. However after a while I noticed that my system speed had been reduced considerably. After troubleshooting and removing the card from my system, everything was back up to speed. It works but at a price."
negative,"Buyer Beware - Defective Cards!: Purchased SimpleTech 256 MB CF card to supplement the meager 32MB CF card which came with my new Canon A80 Camera.After a dozen pictures taken with the SimpleTech card, started getting CF errors on the camera display.Reviewed the Canon owners manual for this error, and acted upon the recommendation to format the card. After reformatting the SimpleTech card, still receive CF Errors when using in the camera after 1 or 2 photos. I am returning the SimpleTech card through Amazon's wonderful return policy. I really do love this e-tailer!My ""meager"" Cannon 32MB card is chugging along just fine...."
positive,"The Beauty of the Winter Solstice Season Incarnate!: I bought this CD without even previewing it, as I'm a Moya fan. Even still, I was blown away by the beauty of it, the simplicity of the vocal lines, and the intricate way in which the tunes are arranaged. This is not your ordinary 'holiday' clone CD; with one more boring recording of the same dozen or so overdone Christmas carols! All of the tracks offer refreshing new 'advents' into the wonder of the Winter Solstice Season. A haunting, blissful album!"
negative,A poor remake: I've been a Delta Force gamer for many years and have upgraded to almost every new version. This one left me dissapointed. So much so that I don't even play it (have stuck with Joint Ops instead.)
positive,"Life jacket seems as advertized and a good value for the price.: I rec'd the vest, opened it, and tried it on but have not used it yet in my Kayak. Hope to do that within the next few months when the weather breaks. As for the quality and look, it seems great for the price."
positive,Dog Bone: It takes about a year for my mastiffs to go through one of these souper bones. Have had them in the past and they last a long time. I have puppy and an adult mastiff. The adult chews on these just as much as the puppy.
positive,"Thank God they finally brought out the widescreen edition: I was given a copy of BABE on DVD a couple of years ago as a gift (my girlfriend--who loves pigs--knew this is one of my favorite movies), but I was thoroughly disgusted to find, upon putting in in the DVD player, that it was a FULLSCREEN edition. I didn't even bother to finish rewatching it. I was further disgusted to learn that a widescreen edition didn't even exist.I was ecstatic to learn while Christmas shopping that a widescreen edition had recently been released. I snatched a copy of immediately, and I am happy to report that the movie was as good as I remembered it being. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscar, and I was pulling hard for it to beat the bathetic and overblown BRAVEHEART for the award. Unfortunately, the best film did not win (as so oftens happens).I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough."
negative,"Do NOT buy this book: Although the idea of scanning and printing out-of-print books is a noble one, this particular effort is criminal. It takes an important text and turns it into a piece of garbage.Consistently, the special Icelandic letters (, , , etc) are rendered as gibberish, and there's no excuse for this. The entire process indicates laziness and stupidity on the parts of the publishers. They scanned and digitalized the the text but were too stupid to realize that often less common fonts don't translate well. They were then too lazy to examine the text and fix this problem. The solution would have been simple: finding a set of fonts that accurately reproduce is not especially difficult, but it clearly was a task beyond the skills of those who produced this waste of paper and who then had the effrontery to try to pass it off as ""An Icelandic Primer"". It is NOT that book. The constant errors in the letters make the text useless.For shame!"
negative,Very dissapointed: I bought this title in hopes that the Synergy version of this movie would have fixed the missing sound effects track which was missing on the WB version. Well it wasn't there. So do yourself a favor and don't buy this version of the DVD if you want to get the missing sound effects track.Will somebody ever fix this!!!???
positive,Welcome to 1059 baseball!: This is a great book that will give you insight on what major league baseball was really like in the late 50's
positive,Good Stuff: This stuff is slick. Just a pea sized drop does the trick and it doesn't chafe. Will deffinatly buy from these guys again
negative,"Not the best DVD edition: I love this movie. It's hard to think of a better masterpiece from the 1980s. It's just too bad I bought this version -- older DVDs like this one have some problems with playback on modern widescreen TVs. Without using the TV's ""zoom"" feature (which basically makes the image larger to fit the screen, but reduces resolution drastically), you have to watch the movie in a truncated box within the screen. There is no true 16:9 output from the disc itself.It is indeed presented in ""widescreen"" format, but the movie plays in a 4:3 setting which shrinks the image to fit within 4:3-sized box in your 16:9 monitor. Not the best way to watch a great movie. I'll have to wait for a Blu-Ray version when I finally upgrade to hi-def.That aside, the extended version of the film is included along with the standard version. But there are almost no special features at all."
negative,Well Made - Poor Historical Accuracy - Anti-Catholic: Plain and simple - this movie is Anti-Catholic and not only skips historical releavance but also changes it - to something that didn't even exist or happen.
positive,"Sherry Woods: I wanted to read all of Sherryl Woods books and have been searching used book stores, several libraries and you had the books"
negative,"Not available.: I don't really hate it, because my order was cancelled for some unclear reason. The order was cancelled several days after I placed it, so I'm no fan of Intex."
negative,no help: I am unable to use this product as I intended. I hooked it up properly (for sure) and it was not able to provide signal from one device to another.
negative,"Pretty pictures, ugly book: If you want to say something is scientific, you have to let people look at what you're doing. You have to let them try for themselves. And if they show that what you're doing doesn't work, you need to be honest about it and admit it yourself. Dr. Emoto fails on each of these points.This book is fake. The scientists in What the Bleep agree that this work is not convincing at all. (The non-scientists are willing to accept it.)There's nothing wrong with fiction. There's nothing wrong with astrology. There's nothing wrong with this book. There is something wrong with calling it truth. That's ugly."
positive,"Wonderful CD: If you decide to buy this CD, please see the movie first. I bought this movie a long time ago for my kids and we all loved the movie, especially the music by Elton. I highly recommend the movie and the CD."
negative,"Half Baked at Best: While I am a BIG fan of Perez-Reverte's work, The Seville Communion was a big let down. I have come to expect more from this literary master.I found the plot and the characters stilted and i could not even finish it. The plot could not hold my attention and I found myself more intruiged with doing the laundry than finding out who dunnit.I hope that Perez-Reverte's next book picks up the pace and is more akin to his first two books. My best advice for this book is don't bother."
negative,"Couldn't get into it.: I'd heard such good things about this book, and couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, I found it really slow. I read the paperback version, and to be honest, I couldn't bring myself to finish the book. Major disappointment."
negative,"Dont make me laugh, no really dont bother.: I was forced to watch this film with my girlfirend. I admit to being a film snob, and ask alot of the film i watch. But when it comes to mindless Buckhiemer stuff i really dont mind them. Then i saw this. Badly acted, scripted and directed. This film represents the kind of mindless stagnation that hollywood seems intent on sticking with. Films like this are a disease on what sould be and is ( sometimes) one of the most creative and efective media forms of the modern day. Please for your own sanity dont bother."
negative,"Disappointing: Other than the setting, i.e., Lithuania, I found the book a great disappointment. More suited for children's literature."
positive,"Good Fan at Great Price: We ordered one for our master bedroom and liked it so much we ordered one for every room in the house. They look great and are perfectly quiet even on high speed. Each fan comes with a balancing kit but only one had the barest wobble (and the balancing kit took care of that in about 2 minutes.) You can mount these flush to the ceiling (the blades are about 6-8"" down from the ceiling that way) or with the included 8"" downrod."
positive,"BOOK: MY GRANDSON WANTED TO READ THIS BOOK. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD SO I BOUGHT HIM BOTH, SO HE COULD ENJOY THE NEXT ONE AS SOON AS HE FINISHED THIS ONE."
negative,"Overhyped mediocre debut: There is no artistry is this first endeavor. Some of the lyrics are painfully odd and Aiken's delivery lacks depth, texture, nuance, finesse, and diversity. Yes, he is a guy who can sing, but he is not an interesting singer. He is certainly not original, nor do I get a sense that there is any real emotion behind the delivery. I feel like I'm being sung at rather than sung to. I admit to never being a fan of glory noting brand of singing, and Aiken only solidifies that conviction.I didn't find him interesting on AI and he is even less so on this debut. Aiken has proclaimed that he is not an artist, just a guy from a reality show. So far, he's confirmed the limitations of his musical aspirations.As for his sales. Well, McDonalds sells alot of burgers... that doesn't make the burgers any better quality. Nothing's wrong with those who enjoy a fast food burger, please enjoy, but don't insist it's filet mignon."
positive,"2nd time around: This is the second time I am ready this series and I love it as much this time as I did 10 years ago when I first read them. The main Character Ayla is wonderful and you become very attached to her from the time you meet her at age 5 through her life. You root for her and cry for her. I can wait to start book 2,3,4,....until the last book which recently came out in 2012.Well worth the 500+ pages"
negative,"If bogus got stars, this would have 10: As an ex-marine I can tell you that the only shred of realism in this thing was the marine being punished for doing well. He can afford a nice house and a new Lincoln Navigator on peon pay. He chases his wifes kidnappers thru a construction zone at 100 MPH, endangering everybody instead of just laying back and using the radio to tell the cops where to put a roadblock. He gets hit in the head with enough stuff to start a junkyard but never shows a mark, gets blown up at least twice without being even singed. The HiPo Camaro takes dozens of hits but they all miss the radiator, tires, electrical and fuel system. Not for anybody older than 10. It did have nice explosions, though."
negative,"Presley's Worst Film: ""Spinout"" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs, such as ""I'll Be Back"" and ""Stop, Look and Listen."" Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie."
positive,"A Really Mad Hatter: This LP shows Chick Corea at his best and better than ever!Chick swings in these nine tracks which include the title track featuring Chick with Herbie Hancock and Gayle Moran,''Humpty Dumpty''with Joe Farrell,Eddie Gomez and Steve Gadd and the 13 minute long masterpiece''Dear Alice''with Gayle Moran."
positive,"Enjoyable sci fi film with Will Smith: Very good movie with great performances by Smith and Greenwood.Another play on the bad robot/good robot, bad cop/good copera, obviously borrowing a lot from films like ""Android""with Klaus Kinski and ""Blade Runner""Robots are hot idea in Hollywood with everything from the new""Robots"" film with Halle Berry to the old early days of robotslike Metropolis.Proyas is becoming an expert in this type of genre, hopefullywill see more to come from him.Two thumbs up for ""I, Robot""!!"
positive,"Mother NIght: All I can say is, this book changed my life. I read it in the mid 70's, and have never forgotten it's message: You are who you pretend to be. So, you had better be very careful who you pretend to be."
positive,plantronics Bluetooth 665 charger: This charger is great for times when you don't have access to your computer. I would highly recommend it for those who travel frequently.
positive,"Solid album: Most of us lost our virginity with Garbage on their first album, so it is kind of hard to top that one. But Version 2.0 comes very close to the thrill I got from the first CD. It's less ""spooky"" than their freshman effort, but more ""powerful""."
negative,"Bought two - both quit in about a year: I use this at my office so it is very convenient. However, each of the 2 different models I purchased quit working in about the same time span of 1 year. Will not spend that much money on one of these again."
positive,A Disturbing Classic !: Meir Zarchi's 'I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE(1977)' is simply one of the most brutal revenge flicks ever made & one of the best of the low-budget 70's exploitation horror films. A must have classic that fully lives up to its infamous reputation. This (Millenium Edition) is quite a treat for genre fans!
positive,DREAMGIRLS: LOVE THIS SHOW. GREAT DVD AT A FRACTION OF THE COST. I ALSO ORDERED THE SOUNDTRACK FROM AMAZON AT A FRACTION OF THE COST.
negative,"The worst Mk up to date.: I have to admit I bought this game but, i am no idiot because I was an Mk fan. This game is exactly the same to the ps version but lacks better music and the loss of FMV due to N64 memory. Besides the story in this is quite messed up with sub zero if you compared his story in mk 1. Sub zero also is toned down and pathetic from jumping in not so high places to the ground. This is only for Mk ""sub-zero"" fans. Another thing is that I was able to beat this game but, still it is too hard to be fun ( and no I don't mean challenging hard)."
positive,"BlackBerry Leather Stand Review: For the money, good product. Does exactly what it says, and very simple. Shop around for the best price, they are all the same."
positive,"Unlike any other resource: The preface and introduction to the book by translator William Scott Wilson is essential to understanding the aphoristic musings of the author in context. As far as I can see (I do not know Japanese), the translation is literate even poetic. I have not found any other book which is a primary source on Bushido and I am using it as a supplement to teaching Mishima Yukio in a class on film and literature. I felt that students needed another context for Mishima's Samurai ideologies. We'll see how it goes down, as I haven't gotten to it yet."
negative,"There is no way I am paying this much for this Kindle book: Will not pay $17 for a Kindle of a 46 year old book! This is just a trumped marketing scheme. What really blows is the $8 version is available at the Amazon UK. Seems the publishers have blocked this sensible version from the US Amazon site. Finally to top it all off, numerous typographical errors throughout the eBook. More evidence of a poor attempt to simply pull some more money from saps."
negative,"could have been better: This movie just felt so cheesy and its so pathetic how this guy asks every woman to marry him. Its a fun date movie but that's all, nothing special. I just felt that the whole movie was recycled and I'm one of those people that wants a little more originality to movies. Besides it reminds me of those cheesy reality tv shows that they have on tv. It just didn't work for me."
positive,"PERFECT FOR A DISTRACTION FROM ALL THAT MATTERS.: I AM A BUSY EXECUTIVE AND SOMETIMES WOULD LIKE TO JUST BE ""ENTERTAINED"" BY A MOVIE. I NEEDED TO FIND A MOVIE THAT I COULD WATCH WITH MY 4 CHILDREN OF VARIED AGES. I CHOSE TO PURCHASE THE DVD WITH MEASURED SKEPTICISM. I WAS PREPARED FOR A DUD AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED THAT THE MOVIE WAS HILARIOUSLY ENTERTAINING. I THOUGHT THE MOVIE'S TWO MAIN CHARACTERS WOULD BE UNTOLERABLY STUPID, BUT WERE JUST A COUPLE OF STONERS. THIS MOVIE WAS SO FUNNY THAT WE WENT OVER OUR FAVORITE SCENES (DVD VERSION) SEVERAL TIMES JUST TO KEEP LAUGHING. THIS WAS A LITTLE LIKE CHEECH AND CHONG, BUT THE ONLY CHARACTER SMOKING POT WAS THE DOG."
negative,"No need for it: There was absolutely no need for this sequel to be made, the original The Rescuers was great and it fully ended and closed up everything. This one however is so horribly made, the ending isn't even half complete and many elements in the movie were left stranded. Not worth your time.Don't waste your money."
negative,"Double printed: I recently purchased this for a gift, but when the book arrived the whole cover had been double printed. We are sending it back and hopefully can get a properly printed book or our money refunded."
positive,Decent performance by Enya: I would have to say its not her Best work but still a solid album if you are a fan. Three Songs I really enjoyed.
positive,"Hilarious!!!: I don't remember the last time I laughed that hard... ""Office Space"" is a great flick, poking fun at daily life at the office. Its ironic and situational comedy is superb, and if you enjoy a good laugh, you love this film. I recently heart of an office-manager playing it for her staff during a meeting, to ""lighten"" everybody up. I think it did the trick! Find out what I mean. ;-)"
negative,"Missing the Ballad of Joking Jesus: The eBook is missing text. I also have a print edition, but I wanted a copy I could read on my phone when i had the time. The part I noticed is missing is the Ballad of Joking Jesus. It's probably missing other text as well."
negative,"The most painful reading and I did finish it.: My wife loved this book. I belong to a book club at work and they chose this book. I finished it. It was painful. Other members in the club also agreed -- It was extremely tedious, repetitiously annoying and not funny."
positive,great product great seller: great product.. and very happy with the seller. Item arrived on time and in great condition. The swaddleMe is the perfect size. Loved how easy it is to use..we no longer use it but highly recommend.
negative,"Very easy to solve!: This puzzle is very easy to solve, I would not recommend it for anyone. Buy the ""original"" ""Don't Break the Bottle"", it will keep you entertained much longer."
negative,"Lmgrubbs: This was not funny at all, I love Gabriel but his friends are not funny! I didn't enjoy it at all"
positive,"Kleenex recommended: I rented this movie and will now buy it for my collection. It's listed as a comedy but it is anything but that. It's more of a tear jecker drama which is why I recommend having tissue handy since it is the true story of a group of poor school girls who face an uncertain economic future and decide to join an Hawaiian dance troupe managed by an out of town (and out of place) ex-dancer. Most of the movie covers a myriad of problems the girls must overcome to even put on the first show. However the ending is spectacular and worth watching. I highly suspect Hollywood will re-make this into an English version as was done with Masayuki Suo's ""Shall We Dance?"". Might as well get a head start and watch the original Japanese version now, plus Yu Aoi is beautiful to see, especially once she dresses up as the Hula troupe lead dancer."
negative,"Dummy Mummy: This movie at times seemed to parellel The Indiana Jones movies, down to near direct quotes ""I hate snakes"" however in The Mummy it was ""I hate bugs"". Alot of the sets and costumes were Indiana Jones inspired.Not only were the actors as dry as the desert they were in, there were it seemed a series of endless shootout scenes, horses running, guns firing, dust flying. These action sequences are nothing more than time fillers and BOREING to watch. The humour in The Mummy was a total distraction and offset the mood of the entire film. It turned into this hokey comedy of sorts, which truely rings pathetic in my book.The romance and pychological aspects of the older monster movies is missing here. It has been replaced by mindless special effects, and what seemed like an endless array of confusing action sequences. Dull characters, dull storyline plus dazzling special effects equal dumb movie. You need more than cool effects!"
positive,"Ok...Lots of key parts left out of the film: I agree with the fact that it is great for kids. I liked it overall, but there were a lot of mistakes. The most blatent of all was at the end of the number of dwarves that dies in the book as different in the film. Also Balog played a big role in the book, but lacking in the film. The Hobbit is a good kids flick you will love it if you've read the novel."
negative,"Uh Oh: I bought this when it came out because of all the hype, I really hadn't heard them on the radio as yet. After one listen I was disappointed..........and two listens I was pissed........after 3 listens I wanted my money back. The lead singer has got one of the worst, off key voices I've ever heard. The instrumentation is far superior over the vocals. I don't get why this band is so popular but to each his own."
negative,"Hugely dissapointing: I bought this having been a huge fan of the cartoon series, but Mr Joyce has taken a winning formula and produced a prize turkey. After 20 pages not only had Ulysses failed to even board his spaceship, but I had no idea at all what on earth was going on. Verdict: Rubbish."
negative,"Broken Pen: The pen itself was visibly as depicted: a Murano-style glass pen, with all the slight irregularities that should be expected of hand-shaped glass. I could not rate how the ink flowed from the pen, as the pen had been very poorly packaged and had arrived broken in two places. Most disappointing, as this pen was intended to be given as a gift."
positive,"Another Friend in the Book Case: Good programming books are not rampant. Manning tends to be a great source, however. They've done it again with this book. And, this time, they have the added attraction of a great, adult sense of humour with Shawn Bayern. If you cannot use JSTL with ease after reading this book, then you will be in the minority. I don't know if Bayern makes the hard easy or the easy easy, but it definitely is made easy. I sailed through this book wondering how 400 plus pages could seem like 90 pages. The best thing is that there is a forest for the trees to live in throughout this book. Bayern is a great teacher. I'm going to look at his other book now. Maybe it is good too."
positive,"Dirty South: This is probably the best southside CD to ever come out. Pretty much every song has a guest or 2 on the track. From the late Fat Pat, to Botany Boys, Mr. 3-2, Big Steve, Chris Ward, H.A.W.K, and many more. This is how a southside CD should always be."
negative,"PAPER JAMS: This printer is awful. I have researched complaints about the 2575 and found tons of consumers with the same paper feed/jam problems. Not only does it take forever getting something printed because of the thing not grabbing the paper, but once it finally decides to feed it chews it up, causing almost half of the pages to be ruined. Great, more money for hp- paper.And how about thier troubleshooting for the issue on the hp website? I feel that hp is aware of the issues, yet their support page lists a few of the common things you should check and if those don't work, they suggest you invest some more of your money in a cleaning kit they sell. That might be ok if you had the thing for a while, but most complaints are from customers who haven't had the thing more than a month.Please do yourself a favor and don't buy it."
positive,"The Pharoah and the Priest: A well researched book, with loads of background about daily life of both the peasants and the nobility, this book was a fascinating read from beginning to end. The story line draws you in and makes you believe it could have happened this way, and brings an ancient time to life. I loved it!"
negative,"Still NOT anamorphic widescreen: This new ""special edition"" released Oct.'03 of TCM still is NOT anamorphic widescreen, just like the previous release...in fact the only thing that makes it a ""special edition"" as compared to the previous release is the double sided packaging! The movie itself is great & normally I would've given this 5 stars, but as far as I'm concerned it's a complete waste of money if it's not anamorphic."
negative,"More Hollywood Garbage: I get sick of the same tired faces. I know these ""stars"" have to make a living, but they should learn a trade, like carpentry. I watched the usual explosions and shootings and got bored after 10 minutes. Overkill as usual."
negative,"Outdated!: This book was good during it's time, but now it is outdated. The book is designed for SCWCD 1.3, and did a great job covering all the topics. However, Sun Microsystem discontinued SCWCD 1.3 on December 2004. So, if you are like me, disappointed with head first books and looking to be certified as fast as possible, do yourself a favor and buy the second edition of this book. You won't regret it."
negative,"Terrible TV: My daughter received this TV for Christmas last year. It was very easy to setup and the strwaberry shortcake screen saver on the TV was cute. The TV and DVD players started having problems 6 months after setting it up. The manufacturers warranty only covers 90 days after purchase. I find that awful since both products started having problems shortly after the warranty expired. Even though it is a ""fun"" I would recommend not wasting your money on this TV and/or DVD player."
negative,"Most Difficult English Assignment I ever had...: I had the honor of reading this book in my 9th grade Advanced English class and while I am an avid reader and love all different types of literature this book still makes me cringe when I see it on summer reading list.While I've read review and I wish I read what they read because it seems like a very good book, but I could not make it through this book to save me. It was 10years ago I had to read this book and I often wonder if I picked it up today would it make any sense? But out of all the books I read throughout highschool and College this book is tedious and very difficult to read.Even with a tutor and note taking I still did not pass the exams that were related to this book."
positive,"The Songs James Taylor Wishes He'd Written: I found this CD for $1.99 in a discount rack two years ago in Palo Alto, and I bought it on a lark, something I almost never do. Out of the thousands of CD's I own, this may be my favorite. I keep searching for used copies, which I purchase for my friends and family members.Arudel's soaring melodies, coupled with the sincerity and warmth of his voice, command attention throughout his collection of nostalgic narratives. It's impossible to pick a favorite tune, as each is soulful, hook-laden, and the product of impeccable craftsmanship.I wish I could thank Arundel personally for the pleasure he's given me with this recording."
positive,"Ease of Use!!: TIVO locked upon install, but chatted with tech support and they provided me a code to get it unlocked. Other than that, operates well, no complaints. Would recommend if you want to have a TIVO set up without having a bunch of ethernet cables ran to it. Can attest that this DOES work with TIVO HD Premiere!! Don't spend extra on the 'G' unless you absolutely want to, this works just fine!!!"
positive,"Informative: Read it all of it. can not say that I will use any of it. As a woodsman we usually go out already prepared and with our own more modern and durable gear. maybe if I were to live out there and have to replace my goods as they will inevitable need replacing with the suggestions in this book, but seeing as I am a working class man and will not live n the woods it just is good reading and that is all."
positive,"Great form factor okay translation: This is the smallest complete Bible I have found that is not a KJV. It is wonderful. It fits in my pants or jacket pocket easily. The one downside is the ESV translation. While this translation is fairly word for word, it seems to go out of its way to be obtuse at certain points. I do not know if this translation will ever gather the following it is hoping for. But if you don't mind a few difficult phrasings and occasional instances of reworded familiar passages than this Bible is perfect for travelling or taking God's Word with you wherever you go."
negative,Edge of Danger by Jack Higgins: I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either.
positive,really good sttuff for right price: when i saw 80 for Farberware stuff i didnt waited for a minute to show it to my wife and we bought it. even thoug some of the items in the box may be useless its enough to get 4 main tools for this rate.really a good deal for ppl who starting the house or just add some more stuff to their existing kitchen closet.
negative,"Unoriginal: Though I am a big fantasy person, I did not enjoy this book. The storyline was very unoriginal, and took so much from Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Even some of the names are similar. He uses the Tolkien elves (tall, fair, wood-dwelling) and Tolkien dwarves (mountain-dwelling, short and bearded), and his story has some of the same ideas wound all through it. For example, from Star Wars he uses ""the boy who has to fight the Empire."" I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially if you are a huge LOTR or Star Wars fan."
positive,"Great Volleyball Bag!: This bag is pretty well made. The seams won't loosen and rip very easily and the strap makes things nice and snug when carrying it to the court. I've used this for different types of balls, indoor balls and sand balls. I'd rather get a different bag for sand balls considering the way sand balls inflate a little in the heat. This is a great addition to your volleyball gear!"
positive,"tobacco pouch: The material and workmanship is excellent, the ""plastic"" zipper pulls aren't good.They broke the first time used and I replaced them with metal ones. Could use a better quality for these, otherwise very useful product."
negative,"Not nearly as good as the hype would lead you to believe.: Ugh...What can I say? The plotline is cliched and boring, the writing isn't memorable in the least, and yes, a lot of it is borrowed from other series.I think a lot of people give Eragon a good rating simply because the author is young--or at least, this influences their review. To tell the truth, I've seen 12-year-olds that write stories that are much more captivating and well-written, and original. They just never get 'em published, which is why a lot of adults are surprised to see a book with 'such good writing for someone his age'--they don't have enough basis for comparison.I don't want to sound like I'M being biased because of Paolini's young age, either (I'm several years younger than him, actually--13) :). Truly, it wouldn't make a difference if he was 5 or 50 to me. A bad book is a bad book... And, well, Eragon is a bad book.I didn't enjoy reading it at all."
positive,"Very Nice Watch for exceptional price: Purchased this watch to wear to a semi-formal party to coordinate with my white gold and diamond accessories. Perfect blend. I love all of the Eco-Drive watches becauses they recharge. I normally wear an 8 inch bracelet and this watch was a perfect fit. I would have preferred a wider watch, but this gives a very dainty look, especially nice for semi-formal wear. Great Price! Arrived on time."
negative,"GARGAGE: Please. Save your money and don't buy this or any other book by Gail Howard. The entire premise of number combinations that are more likely to hit is bogus. It sounds good but its not real. Do some research online about statistics and probability. Each remaining ball has the same odds of being drawn. There is no skill to these types of lottery games-unlike say following the remaining scratch ticket prizes available for a certain game online and seeing what is the best buy. She has her success by people randomly winning with her book. Those that win are publicized. Those that don't are quietly forgotten. Seriously, youll win more money by taking the money you would have spent on this book and buying lottery tickets."
negative,"The Bad before the Good: This book was absolutely awful until I reached the notes at the end of the book. I was bored by the lack of theme to the story and much of the visual descritpion was unnessecary. I was also confused by the absence of important information. Not until the end of the book did I realize that the story took place during World War II. Also, I could not decipher who the boys were and why they were all together yet did not know each other for some time. Once I reached the reflective notes at the end, though, I was very impressed by the symbolism and hidden ideas in the book. I would only prefer to find them myself in the reading, rather than be told them at the end. For instance, I made no connection as to how the sow was killed to rape because the killing was not vividly described, and no resemblance was obvious. The notes told me that, and I understood the total point the author was trying to make more, but I was still disappointed that I could not have made the connections myself."
negative,"Discovery Atlas Italy & Australia DOES NOT WORK: I have done some researching online and found out that these 2 HD-DVDs have been recorded in a different way from the Brazil & China which do work. DO NOT ORDER this product until they have created a working batch. I have also spoken with Discovery Channel and they advised they are aware of the problem and are trying to get this problem resolved. I was advised to return the product from where I bought it and keep checking back with them. Be very cautious who you purchase this from. You dont want to order a defective title and then not be able to get your refund. The only ones working at this time as mentioned above is Brazil and China, you should be ok ordering those."
negative,sent two back: IVE HAD TO SEND TWO OF THESE BACK NOW. THEY SHUT OFF AND WONT TURN BACK ON. THESE ARE DISCOUNTINUED AND I BELEIVE THE BATTERIES ARE SHOT IN THEM.I WOULDNT BUY ONE!!
positive,"wonderful: I have had over 10 pairs of easy spirit shoes and have these in two colours. I have high insteps, high arches and hammertoes... and these are still comfortable. The support is not as good as in their running and training shoes, yet plenty good for walking long distances and taking public transport daily."
negative,"Essential film, not so good transfer (Criterion Spine # 6): Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast is a universal masterpiece. But the transfer for this edition (Criterion Spine #6) is not up to the editor's usual standards : scratches, jumps, blurs and sound hissing. Plus... the opening credits are not the wonderful original ones, when Cocteau is seen writing the names of the film crew on a school blackboard. Wait a while and get the new Criterion edition, due in late 2002 !"
negative,"Bad Nike Shoe: The Nike TRIAX Air Structure 10 I purchased had a very poorly made left shoe, leaning far to the left. It makes me wonder if it is a 'knock-off' instead of Nike. I'll stick to my old source and style."
positive,"Genius Pushed to the Edge: The loving, but possessive, father's effect on his son is poignant. The son's genius is recognized, and he is pushed toward realizing it, but simultaneously held back, creating tensions in the son which ultimately lead to a breakdown. We understand that they are Jewish. The scene of the father looking over the fence, is at once foreboding of, and reminiscent of, peering through the fence at Auschwitz, or some other Nazi extermination camp. The son's decision to break away in deciding to pursue training in England, saves him from the Holocaust, but can only increase the guilt feelings that he experiences. The use of Rakhmaninov's Third Piano Concerto, profoundly comples and beautiful, gives a rich texture to the tapestry of this moving film biography. Art is redeeming, and after years of breakdown and suffering, the master pianist finds his own salvation, and his ability to accept love."
negative,"excellent detective story trying to get out of boring novel: At the heart of the book is an excellent detective story of perhaps 100 pages which matches the better pieces of Agatha Christie. The trouble is that Grisham padded it out to a full-scale novel by throwing in everything but the kitchen sink: Missipppi corrupt politics, black history and cooking, the Viet Nam war, and so on. There should be a law against such blatant padding!"
negative,"Please email me tell me why this is not drivel: My daughter just finished her first year as a literature major at an Ivy League school and we spoke about Finnegans Wake.For years, I have asked English Lit experts what is the genius of Finnegans Wake. No one could give me a straightThe Emperor has no clothes. No one knows why this is great, save for some so called experts who extol this book.I beg of anyone out there, please email me tell me why this is not drivel. You can reach me at alkruse@gmail.com"
positive,"Great gift: My brother in law got me a set of these and I think they're one of the best accessories I've ever used. Sound quality is outstanding, I hear no static even 2 floors down when I'm doing laundry, and the extra battery charges in the base so you can quickly swap out if you run out of juice. Comfortable as heck. I don't know why the other person said they weren't tight enough, unless he had a really small head. I think the tension is perfect, but I'm a 6'2"" American guy so your mileage may vary."
negative,"What Women Don't Want!: What Women Want was a smash hit when it was released but this romantic comedy is unfunny and way too long. Mel Gibson gives another solid performance but I just couldn't relate to this film and I am a woman! Helen Hunt was so over-rated when this film was making millions of dollars at the box office but jeez you never hear anything about her anymore, her ship has sailed. This is a movie you rent or borrow from a friend, not worth purchasing!"
negative,"Pretty disappointed: I saw the movie and was intrigued enough to read the book, which I thought would maybe give a better idea of what really happened in West Virginia that year. I was disappointed to find that Mr. Keel spent a lot of time dwelling on UFO encounters and the history of UFO encounters and spent little time talking about the events in West Virginia, other than how it blended with the history of UFO-logy. The movie was more interesting, and I don't know how they developed a movie based off of this book. I didn't buy the book to read about Air Force involvement (or maybe lack thereof) in UFO sightings or about how Mr. Keel had been hunting UFOs and UFO witnesses. A big letdown."
negative,"NOT in 3D: just a little heads up for everybody, despite the tittle and amazon stating that this is a 3D version of the film, it is NOT. it is nether anaglyph nore the old Field Sequential active shutter 3D,technically this is false advertisement... so BUYER BEWARE!!and I gave 1 star for this reason."
negative,"Did not get what I ordered: I just got these stockings but the seller sent me a way smaller size (A-B) than I ordered, I e-mailed them telling them about the problem and will keep you dear buyer posted. I cannot tell you about anything about the quality or color because I have not opened the ones I received."
negative,"Review of Grasshopper Pilot: A Memoir: I have an interest in the L-4, and thought this might be interesting. I felt the book lacked military detail, and was too general in its presentation. I would have enjoyed more information about the places and events."
negative,"Very bizarre one-sided perspective: I've read most of this book and the more I've read the more bizarre it is. Noble claims that hypertension, anemia, and gestational diabetes are natural aspects of pregnancy that can be harmful if treated. She says bedrest is actually harmful, that ultrasounds increase fetal mortality and left-handedness (???) and a host of other claims. She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism, water births, home births, doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds. Though my twins are big and healthy I certainly didn't take the advice in this book.This is not medically sound advice nor is it objective or open-minded. It is a book of extreme views."
negative,Hugely biased.: The authors use of words make the British Redcoat seem foolish and weak. If this book is meant to be about the battles of the revolution then why are all the American victories listed and yet not all of the British ones? Makes no sense to me seeing as the British won most of the battles.If you want to read a 'false feel good propoganda' type of book then feel free to go for this one BUT take everything you read with a massive pinch of salt. It's these type of books that have completely churned factual history into a euphoria of false patriotic rhetoric.Rebels and Redcoats will provide you with a far more comprehensive and factual base from which to look at the war from.
positive,"Different Covers: I love this book! The cats are beautiful! It works great for needlepoint also. I only gave it a four, because I couldn't do 4.5. My main pet peeve is that the covers get changed on books and if I don't catch it, I end up with duplicates. Luckily I could look inside to compare. My copy is paperback with a ginger cat on the cover... not a tiger, otherwise it would have been a 5."
positive,"An Undesputed Classic: I read the Stranger (actually i read the translation entitled The Outsider, but it's the same thing) in my grade 11 world literature class. The book revolves around the main character named Meursault. The novel, deep rooted in its existentialist theme, is one of the most mentally stimulating books you will ever read. Albert Camus suggests that the pinnacle of hypocrisy in society is its quickness to judge people upon appearances or behavior, versus its apparent incapacity to judge people upon fact. I will refrain from making any conjectures about the novel, its theme and message, because that is something you must do for yourself. After reading the novel, dont rush to the internet to read essays and reviews about the novel. Instead spend some time contemplating the book yourself. Then open yourself to the opinions of others. It is one of those books that you will never forget, and will change the way you see things, at least temporarly."
negative,Look else where for your vaccum: The unit works very well at begining. My wife ordered the second one based on the first one. So we have actually two of these Hoover Elite Rewind Bagless vaccums at our house(one for each floor). Both units broke belt once within 6 months of use. No biggie. I took out 5 screws at bottom of each unit and replace belt for each unit. Now one of unit develop the suction issue. It simply won't pick up any thing anymore. I finally realized after took it apart that there is a filter inside of canister that is completely clogged up. I don't think it is washable. I will need to replace the filter for each unit. Folks. You save money on bags but this one will get you on the filters (around $5 each) and probably last you 6 months of less. I have hardwood floors/tiles at my house. I have no pet but 3 kids. I suggest look else where for a good vaccum.
negative,"Sailors' Valentines: A cleaverly package book. Nice pictures of old Valentines, however using one with a questionable picture spoils the entire book."
negative,"too many ads, not enough interesting material: i was hoping to gain some entertainment while reading things that will keep my interest but like most magazines, this was full of ads and the articles either seemed generic or just didnt keep my attention."
positive,I believe is a good product: I did not get to try it on my camera because I made the mistake of ordering the wrong size but I wanted to keep it.
negative,"this cd is misnamed-it should be elo part2-no jeff lynne: This cd is misnamed. It should not be called ELO but rather ELO Part2. This band does not contain Jeff Lynne, who was responsible for all of the songs on this cd. While ELO Part2 does contain several of the original members (ie. Bev, Mik, Kelly) the one member it misses the most is Jeff Lynne. If you are looking to buy this simply on the track list, don't, especially if you think this is the old ELO. If you already have heard some of the new ELO material then buy it because the songs are fresh. However, it does sound like a very good cover-band doing old ELO music."
positive,The Best: If you have yet to see this get it now. One of the best movies ever made. Will stay with you for days after seeing it.
positive,"Can be read on different levels but take it for what it is.: I just read this book with my daughter, actually she read it aloud to me. We enjoyed the photos very much. We laughed, gasped and said ""uh-oh"" a lot. I must admit to finding the spanking scene a bit odd for a children's book but my daughter didn't seem to think anything of it. And no, she has never experienced anything like that herself. Maybe it is because she reads a lot of british children's books i.e Enid Blyton's Famous five series and Roald Dahl books that the darker side of kids lit does not faze her. I came to Amazon to find out what others thought of this book and was not surprised what I found. It all became clear when I learned a little about the author's early life. What a creative way to express her pain. Kids wont see any of those elements and wont care to either, they'll just enjoy the story."
positive,"Muddy be smokin': This is a culmination of rarely heard Muddy sides spanning from the late forties to the mid fifties. Muddy puts his own spin on The Wolf's ""Smokestack Lighting,"" and unleashes some of the best tunes (in my opinion)ever recorded. ""Little Anna Mae,"" ""Stuff You Gotta Watch,"" and ""Lonesome Day"" are some of my favorite tunes of all time. Little Walter adds a whole new level of eloquent intensity to the cuts on which he appears. If you like Muddy, you will love this. Essential."
positive,"Journey to spirtuality: I enjoyed reading this book. What was difficult to understand but the authors referenced with other materials to guide you along. If you are on your path to balancing your spiritual awareness, add this book to your collection.JAM"
positive,"Fun and Easy to follow workout: This video makes exercising enjoyable. Rich adds enjoyment to the workout, he shows different ways of doing the moves, so people like myself, who aren't in the greatest shape can follow along and feel like they are part of the video. I've TRIED Tae Bo, and other kickboxing aerobics videos, but they were way TOO FAST, and I had NO chance of getting a workout because I couldn't keep up with the moves. The people who made those videos must have forgotten about people like me, and the majority of the population that isn't in great shape. But I am happy to say that Rich Grogan and his Kick to Get Fit program remembered us. I actually look forward to doing this video."
positive,"The CADILLAC of Tweezers: These tweezers are the BOMB! They are sharp and precise and grip even the shortest, most stubborn hairs and pluck them cleanly out. I threw all my other tweezers away and will only use Tweezerman. They are the BEST!"
positive,"One of the best underwater pictures ever made!: This is an excellent effort by Cameron. It is a thinking person's film that includes superior characterizations, a thoughtful script, and outstanding special effects (the wreck of the sub at the beginning is a knockout and the Sea Tentacle forshadows the ""bad terminator"" in T2)!. The plot pacing is a little slow and the aliens as shown are much too benign to be truly frightening. Mastrantonio is just a little too strident, Ed Harris is his usual virile self and Biehn is excellent as the antagonist. Go only with the laser edition that includes the expanded footage, otherwise the entire movie doesn't make sense at the end!!! The extras on the laser also explain how Cameron made it all come together. This is a movie for the entire family to enjoy together and discuss afterwards. Highly recommended."
positive,"leave your seat and hop a plane!!!: I saw this movie at a sneak preview and will see it again when it comes out just because I know a few people who need to see this movie. This movie is a tune-up for the soul. If anyone has been down on thier luck or not so lucky in love this movie will pour some sweetness into that bitter place. I laughed, I cried several times this movie evoked that youthful part inside me that needs to be awakened every so often. With the beautiful cinematography and portrayal of the people you want to leave your seat and hop a plane for Tuscany. I heard so many people saying that as they left the theatre. Go see this movie and laugh and cry all at the same time."
positive,"good product: Wow I paid over double the current price for these. I see that they are now priced at ""the number of lives that a cat has"".They are very soft and comfortable. I like wearing cotton T-shirts so these are right up my alley. And people that see them are surprised at the material because I guess these are not common.I am very happy and the price right now is a steal!"
negative,"Clockwork Orange = 0 stars: This is not a movie worth watching. The story line may or may not be a good one, I can not say because the movie was so terrible we had to turn it off 20 minutes into the movie (which was after trying to give it a chance because we wanted to turn it off 5 minutes into the movie). If this is a movie that you really must see, then be prepared for full nudity and other disturbing sexual scenes. Please note, I only gave this one star because Amazon made me rate it. It really deserves 0 stars."
negative,"NO use!!!: It feels good after washing with it, but it has no effect on my fungi-nail at all!!! But it do feels good using it to wash."
positive,Pete Seeger's Greatest Hits: This is a very nice album. It is the first and only Seeger album I have ever owned. It will be a nice addition to my collection.
positive,"Hitman is a nastier Norris movie and Chuck's best!: The Hitman gives us a darker more brutal and vile Chuck Norris who is also a very sensitive and moral guy too. He's a deadly vile hitman with a heart! Michael Parkes is in this one too as an over-the-top evil doer who makes other movie bad guys look pale and shoulda got an Academy Award! Really he's that amazing! The combo of a crazed Parkes and a nasty Norris make this violent, and even xenophobic, bloody mess a real gem. This is one fun flick and Norris' best!"
negative,Poor quality: Looked very cheap. Black plastic speaker worn. Also a bit too big for home use. There are also two loose pieces require tapes to hold them together with main frame. Yak
negative,River Runs Red through your wallet: Historically this book is awful. Don't waste your money. There are scores of factual errors in this book and inaccurate suppositions. This book should be more properly listed as historical fiction. The errors in here are too numerous to list.LM
negative,UNCONVINCING: Something between a documentary and a movie there are serious problems with the plot. Remove Pacino and it is worth very little. This is a pity because the topic is important.
negative,"Not what it seems: I bought this to replace a broken Brookstone sound machine. First off it is bigger than I anticipated and it uses water. The information presented does not state it needs water. I wouldn't have bought it had it said ""you must add water"". There is no way to turn off the water part (which means you need water for the electronic sounds)It needs to be cleaned all the time (even using distilled water).The electronic sounds do not seem as real to me as the Brookstone one did. Wave cycles too fast, etc. For the cost of RAM these days you would think they could have a sound loop longer than a second or so. The Brookstone one was about 7 seconds for a sound loop and you had to listen carefully to hear the replete. Not bad considering I purchased the Brookstone unit in 1996. No so with this unit."
positive,"Classic audio book: The Audio book ""Fahrenheit 451"" was purchased by me as a gift for a friend who has limited eyesight. He reports that the book is of exceptional quality and very easy to use. I would recommend this book based on his comments. I have read this book in hardback, and it is a very good book by Ray Bradbury."
positive,"Must have!: A friend of ours gave this to us for our baby shower and we're so glad that they did. Our daughter who is 7 months old loves this toy (it's been in her crib since she was a month old). It has helped calm her when she was fussy and also helped her go to sleep. As soon as we press the button and the sound of the ocean is playing, she always focuses her attention to the toy. We definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a crib toy for their baby. It's a must have!"
positive,"Awe-Struck: Nicolas Cage, Cher and Danny Aiello are involved in a strange 3 way love affair. Two brothers who do not speak to eachother fall for the same woman. Set in modern day Brooklyn, this story of lust and love is surrounded with the Italian/American flavor that is the thread of Danny Aiello's best film work. Throw in Olympia Dukakis as Cher's ugatza mother, and Vincent Gardenia as Cher's Sfachima father, and funny things happen. Add a star if you're from Brooklyn, add 2 stars if you're Italian. An Oscar winning 1980's comedy/romance!"
negative,"WHAT A HORRIBLE BOOK!!!!: The author needs to get educated and start living in the 90's! She thinks her opinion is the right opinion and that she speaks for all women and children! She doesnt speak for me! Of all the horrors going on in the world, this is all she can complain about? What a waste of time!"
negative,Did not want to use again: The smell was overwhelming and the color on the product was coming off after one use. I threw it away and felt like a made a mistake purchasing it. I should have listened to the other reviews.
negative,"STAY AWAY: I would not even give this phone to my 4 year old. My daughter was recently hospitalized out of town, and for convenience sake I had to use my cell phone instead of long distance. I moved around, went outside (under a clear sky) and had absolutly horrible reception. The entire time you are on the phone with someone, you expect them to disappear, because his phone is terrible. Pick something else."
positive,"A Hospital Stay can be Stressful...: A hospital stay can be stressful, specifically for toddlers. My grand-daughter was having major surgery and this book aided in comforting her. It eliminated the unknown factors of a 1st time hospital stay."
negative,"What was so good about this movie?: This movie was incredibly boring. The whole movie is basically one long chase scene which is never finished. To jlind555: if Popeye Doyle is as you described him, "" a racist, selfish, insensitive,"" person, then why is he such an interesting character? Also you said that these traits helped him in his chase against the criminals. But didn't you see the ending? Doyle never catches the ringleader of the drug traffic. Those harsh characteristics of his obviously didn't help him very much.After watching this movie, I was extremely surprised to find that it won several academy awards. This movie does have some very well done scenes, but the overall message of the film seems very pointless."
negative,"Review From One Book At A Time: I hate giving classics bad reviews. This book was not for me. Nothing captured my attention and I found that I had to force myself to read it. If it had been any longer I would have stopped. It did catch my interest a little in the end, but not enough to redeem the book in any way."
positive,"Sirus Blacks Escape: This is a pretty cool set. The only thing wrong is that is should be a little taller like in the movie. This set really recreates the tower in the movie. The only thing wrong is the door. It should be like a prison door like in the movie, not a wooden one. Some good things about this is only one of two sets that have buckbeak, one of four sets that have a dementor, and only one of two sets that have Sirus Black. I RECOMEND THAT YOU BUY THIS!!!"
positive,"Good Coffee Warmer: This is my first coffee warmer, and I like it. It keeps the coffee pretty warm (it won't burn your tongue, but it's pretty warm).Out of curiosity, I set yesterday's cold coffee on the warmer and it managed to warm the cold coffee.BTW, this coffee warmer will keep a bowl of soup warm as well."
negative,"don't even bother: It has no adapters so unless you are using the Italian or French standard you'll need another adapter. Also, don't expect much with 50 watts... this thing melted the first time I used it."
negative,Stunk: I am a die hard stargate fan...this movie was really bad....wish that stargate would stop taking advantage of its loyal fan base by making this straight to DVD movies....end the series or put in back on the air...(i would have much prefered to pay $10 to go see on big screen vs buying the expensive dvd.)
positive,"A Family's Struggle: Eisenhart uses a series of poems to tell the story of her mother's life and struggle with Alzheimer's disease.The mother, Viola, was not necessarily an easy woman for her children to deal with, but she lived passionately and expressed herself vividly.After the death of her husband, everything changed. Without his assistence, suddenly she could no longer conceal her memory loss. Gaps in her memory brought rage first, then panic. Her children had to deal with unwarrented suspicion and their own fear about her driving. Ultimately, they persuaded her to go into a nursing home.Eisenhart's tender, perceptive poems, illustrated with family photos, make this book one that any family in a similar situation can relate to."
negative,"Nothing surprising or worthwhile: Not all that interesting, esp if you have read a lot in this genre. This Bronte book is the closest of all the Bronte novels to a Jane Austen type of story. It isn't tragic, it plods along, lots of dialogue. It is obvious from the beginning what is going to happen at each turn--unhappy marriage for money, an ill-treated governess who slooooowly falls for a clergyman, etc. Very formulaic."
positive,I love it!!!!: I love it. It is thick and tight. I would buy more but it is a little too expensive. YES
negative,"DONT BUY THIS JUNK UNLESS YOU ARE AN ELF: They charge almost $15 for this condom oops I mean hat, that costs only $2 in the store!!!!! And it's tiny it's like they made this for an elf.... Don't buy"
positive,"Great product: Have been using this for 3 months now & find it very easy to use, i rarely need to use the high watt bulb as the low is so good. But in dark streets you are able to switch between easily. I love the fact that it gives you the 1/2 hr warning before it runs out. It is very compact and fits on the top of your bar out of the way."
negative,"why this book is so popular, I will never know: Eragon has been hailed as an epic story written by a teenage prodigy, but few seem to realize the sad truth about this book and its sequel. There is barely any original plot or characters in this entire series, and it very much lacks in writing talent and ability. If it had been written by, oh say, a middle aged person who had experience in the writing field, it would have never been published. The author simply takes chunks from other, better stories such as the popular Lord of the Rings trilogy, Earthsea, the Dragon Riders of Pern, and Starwars, and pretends they are his own ideas. I highly recomend you skip this book and look for something with a little more taste."
negative,"Not his best work: This CD includes two of Elvis' movie soundtracks from 1965, Harum Scarum (aka Harem Holiday) and Girl Happy. While both soundtracks reached the top 10 on the US album charts and Girl Happy was certified GOLD, they are not particularly strong albums. This set is recommended only for avid Elvis fans."
negative,At least it's short and cheap: I don't really have to say anything more than the reviewers before me have said. Thankfully the book is short so if you do fall victim to reading it you won't have wasted much time and if you've purchased it you won't have wasted much money. The only reason I've given it even one star is because it is about Rush and their music. It is just plain awful.
negative,"Disappointing: I can't believe that other reviewers gave this book 5 stars. I was completely disappointed. The book included very little useful information to help kids make good nutritional choices- ""fruits and veggies are awesome"" was about the extent of it. The text is uninteresting and cumbersome to read aloud, and the illustrations are not appealing. I am returning this book."
negative,"Ludicrous and silly: I remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it. Basically, while I will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories, this book was basically silly."
negative,"bad mix (avec clashes etc.): I would class myself as a dance music critic (having over 3000 songs in my possession and being a dj myself) and I can safely say that the mixing in this cd is shocking. Not only do they not bother to get the bpms sinked (in cd2) but many of the tracks clash so violently that it makes me want to perpetrate a criminal act to the ministry of sound website. No, but seriously they picked a great set of tracks but did a bad job of combining most of them. I reckon if they had just left the cd unmixed it would have solved a lot of problems (employing a dj for one).Peter m."
positive,wonderful!: It was shipped right away and arrived before time allowed. It was packaged well and the product arrived just fine. Love the pans and would recommend them to everyone.
positive,"perfect sense: It just makes perfect sense to me when I read the angel stories in this book. How powerful, yet so gentle these angels are. It was so inspiring to read each story. Thanks to Joan Wester Anderson for sharing her gift of writing and speaking."
positive,"An excellent sailing reference: This is by far one of the best sailing books available for both beginning and experienced sailors.As I was learning to sail, a friend suggested it and I learned more from this one book than any other I have seen or bought and I own 10+ books on sailing. I carried it with me for over a year and read portions every time I had a few minutes.Highly recommended reading for sailors or anyone interested in sailing or sailboats."
negative,"It was Great... for five minutes.: I'm giving this two stars because the problem may be a one-off. My son received this as a Christmas gift yesterday. I unpackaged it this morning and wound it up and it worked great. My kid loved it, the melody was nice and all was grand. Until I tried to wind it up again. I heard a loud snapping sound and the winding wheel started spinning free. I opened up the case to see if the problem is repairable, but it's not. The gear that attaches the winding wheel to the music box is made from a cheap, flimsy plastic, and all the teeth had snapped off. I have an email in to the toy company to see if they can help me get a replacement part, and if they do I will update my rating to make it more favorable."
negative,"WHAT??? GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!: Hell, I'm not even going to read this book before I tell you all what I think! No reason to waste my time reading ANYTHING written by an animal like Manson.I'm kind of in to learning more about infamous cases like Manson's...but I'd like to hear THE TRUTH about what happened. And the criminals themselves usually do NOT tell the truth. They usually do have a way of detaching themselves, if you will, from the identity they had when they committed or instigated whatever the heck the crime was. So if I read on one of the reviews, that it doesn't sound like Manson...Gosh, why on earth am I not surprised!Hey...for a good laugh, I guess this would be OK to read...just to see how a beast like Manson operates.But I give this one star...like I said, consider the sanity of the source of information in this book...and do your best to not believe it unless someone in their right mind can confirm it.Otherwise, enjoy!"
negative,"So-So: I honestly believe that paganism, religion whatever you want to call it is about bettering yourself. Not begging to diety to give you everything you want. Silver claims to belive the same thing but then provides spells for love and money. How many books does she need to publish on the same information. It seems to me that she is just trying to get her 15 minutes of fame, and make a bunch of money. There is nothing new in this book that makes it a 'must read'. If you want an introduction Paganism: An Introduction to Earth-Centered Religions by Joyce and River Higginbotham is much better."
negative,"Does not heat coffee enough to justify use: This ""Mug Warmer"" does exactly what it promises. It warms the mug. Not the coffee. The plate never got hot enough to keep my coffee sufficiently warm."
positive,"OK but.... How Do I Extend the Timer??: Great toy.. Calms our little girl down before bed. Great White noise for young babies. Only have a young baby, so not sure only value of it as she approaches 6+ months. I wish it stayed on for more than 3 pr 4 minutes though.. Anyway to override this? Our baby is lulled and then will jump at the noise because I need to turn it back on."
negative,"Please do not waste your money!: I first heard about this movie about twenty years ago and had always wanted to see it.It's been banned in the UK for many years and decided to use the u.s. mail service to get myself a copy.What a bad,bad decision! This is without doubt the most boring,tedious,badly acted movie i have ever witnessed.My Dvd copy is now used as a coaster!David/England"
positive,"Céline is at her best in French!: Whenever people criticize me for being a Céline Dion fan, I always tell them to listen to her in French because it is so much better than her English recordings. While I like many of those as well, 1 Fille & 4 Types is of the same quality as D'eux and S'il Suffisait D'Aimer. The melodic quality and intimacy of these recordings really makes her vocals shine without the overblown aspects people tend to dislike in her English songs. Give it a try!"
positive,"Haunting and Lovely: The first time I read this book, it entranced me. To put it tritely, ""I could not put it down."" This book is amazingly enchanting, though can seem a bit obtuse. I confess, I had to re-read it before I began to understand the point. You will find yourself discovering new facets of the story each time you read it, which I have done several times. It is a piercingly beautiful story, written with Lewis' clear, sharp talent."
negative,"At War With the Army rating: I disliked this DVD because close to the end of the movie it was all defected or scratched up and I did not get to see the end of the movie. I mean it was Jerry Lewis, so I know there were some good laughs at the end. So disappointed."
positive,this is a really great product: Great face cleanser. My husband and I use it every morning. Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh. Removes makeup easily as well.
negative,"Where is the plot?: I have always been a fan of John Grisham's writing, defending him in the face of my intellectual friends who consider him to be formulaic and predictable. My response has always been, ""Who cares, as long as he keeps writing books with such scintillating plots and characters?""But this latest offering is a bitter disappointment. The pace is plodding and never amounts to anything: no suspense, no drama, not even an interesting string of events. The characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs. The book reads like a boring photo album, with quick descriptions penned on the back of each picture. The most telling sign is the utter lack of emotional depth, especially when this book is apparently supposed to be a heartwarming tribute to Grisham's somewhat idealized memories of the Deep South.I kept reading this book until the bitter end, convinced that Grisham was going to turn things around. He doesn't. Skip this turkey and save yourself the time and aggravation."
positive,"dolly can do no wrong: This cd blew my mind the second i listened to it! Dolly knows country like no other and this hould be a lesson to all those tired pop-country acts cramming the airwaves: this is how to do country, bluegrass and any kind of roots music for that matter. her rendition of ""Silver Dagger"" gives me chills. she is just the queen of country."
positive,"Alternate title = I'll try if i want to: It could be described as a case of ""Why did they do that?"", because although Be Here Now is a great album, it is tarnished by musical blemishes such as Don't go away and The girl in the dirty shirt. But we forgive Be Here Now of it's weaker points because of its strong ones. These strong points include D'You Know What I Mean?, My Big Mouth, and the (underrated) future classic, It's gettin' better (man!!). Maybe its me, or maybe oasis should forget about ballads and soft songs and stick to Rock 'n' roll of which they are the undisputed champions. It might be lack of inspiration or (more likely) lack of effort which contributes greatly to the more laboured efforts mentioned earlier, but overall, Oasis deserve a pat on the back for giving us some more of that unmistakibly ""Oasis"" tunes that are entirely worthy of your dosh."
negative,"Sad, sad, sad: I wish I'd read the reviews before I rushed out and bought the book. I've been waiting with baited breath for 11 years for this book, and I couldn't be more disappointed. CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR was terrific; VALLEY OF THE HORSES was interesting; THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS was a little disappointing because of all the cavegirl meets caveboy, cavegirl loses caveboy, cavegirl gets caveboy back. But I enjoyed THE PLAINS OF PASSAGE, trying to figure out what part of Europe they must be in.I agree with a reviewer who said that it's amazing that an editor let this stuff fly. It totally pains me to say it, because I was such a fan. The book could have been cut in half if all the endless introductions were left out and the repitious backstory condensed.Even when the story was tired in the other books, I was interested in the healing aspects, the literary suppositions of religion, and the other anthropology insights.It read like a lot of cutting and pasting to me. Wish it hadn't."
negative,"This Mouse Hates Keyboards: It really isn't that this mouse is the worst, it is just that it seems to be useless if you do not have a basic keyboard (ie: just the 101 keys, no easy one-touch access keys).When I used my basic keyboard it worked fine, no faults. But with the enhanced keyboard it would lock up the computer or just stop functioning.So instead of buying this mouse, you should look into the Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical. For only a couple of dollars more you could have the reliability and stability of a mouse that will be fully supported by a Windows system."
negative,"Come Watson, the games afoot!: Unfortunately, it's two left feet on this occasion. I bought the book as I am a big fan of both Holmes and Dracula stories, but despite the sometimes colorful characters, it was a tedious read."
negative,"Disappointed: We have almost all of Enyas CD's and listen to them almost religiously for relaxation. Looked forward to a new one. We pre ordered, it came and...Talk about non-triditional...It's boring...for lack of a better word. With the talent she has, what a terrible waste. Maybe I'm too old fashion, but making up a language along the way just to get the sounds..... In one cut the same sounds, (as they are not words) are repeated so many times I thought the CD player was stuck. I got up and gave it a wack. Well thanks for ""Paint the Sky"", ""The Celts"", ""Trees"", and the others. This one is disappointing, wish I had kept the money. Hugh and Dee"
positive,"Clear, Concise Overview of Essential Grammar Points: As an English teacher who has worked with community college, adult education, high school, and international students, I recommend this thin, practical book.In less than 200 pages, Grammar for Smart People introduces and reviews the essential grammar points that we should know and sometimes forget. ESL students will also find it clear, direct, and useful. This thin book also contains more real information than many far more expensive, thick, and mandated college textbooks. It's far superior and cheaper than the vastly over-rated Betty Azar series for English language learners or the many other drill and kill textbooks imposed on too many vocational education and community college students.If you want an affordable, portable, and practical grammar guide, buy this Grammar for Smart People."
positive,"One of the best albums of the 1990's: Lauryn hit solid gold with this album. The choice cuts are Doo Wop, everything is everything and lost ones. This deserves every grammy given to it."
positive,"Dreams Come True!: Disney's ""Pinocchio"" is the third installment of the ""Walt Disney Gold Collection"" as of March 7th, 2000. The ""Walt Disney Gold Collection"" is a group of films that inspire wonder and imagination for a life time, and ""Pinocchio"" fits that escription perfectly!Geppettpo is a lonely wood carver until one night when the blue fairy grants his wish of his puppet Pinocchio becomeing alive. But it's up to Pinocchio to finish Geppetto's wish of him becoming a real boy. If Pinocchio can prove himself brave, truithful, and unkind, he will be a real boy. Even though he has the help of Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio gets sidtracked. And when Geppetto is swallowed by a whale, it's up to Pinocchio to save the day.The great thing about the ""Walt Disney Gold Collection"" is that they include special features weather they are on video or DVD. ""Pinocchio"" has ""A Wish Come True: The Making of Pinocchio."" So if you bought the video when it first came out, you may consider buying it again."
positive,A Practitioner's Resource: Levy and Lemeshow's text provides practitioners with precise formulas and terrific insights into alternative sampling methods. The exercises at the end of the chapters are particularly useful.
negative,"Poor quality- broke after a week use.: Purchased for a collective playroom. The toy arrived is great condition: fun design and great colors. Adults and kids loved it! But It stopped spinning only after a week. The frog just wouldn't go down, as if something was blocked inside. There was nothing to be done, and the toy was useless as it was. I had to throw it away, which was very disappointing for a Chicco toy."
positive,"The video games we used to play as kids....: My 9 year old son received a GameCube for Christmas and the 2 games he received were WaveRunner and Luigi's Mansion. Both of those games he liked, however I have motion sickness bad and cannot play alot of the games they have out now because of all the movement. I specifically bought this Namco Museum for me and guess what everybody loves it! It is great to be able to show my son some of the older games we used to play as kids. I just wish it had Centipede on it..That would be great. Enjoy all you Pacman and Galaga fans...."
positive,"Thats a question you should ask yourself....: From the time I first watched this Movie in the theater as a little boy, to the time I watched it as I grew up over and over until the tape broke and I had to buy a new copy. Until now in my manhood, I have loved this Movie, the pinical turning point in the transformers G1 history. I remember jumping up durring Prime's and Megatron's battle, and then feeling my heart lurch out of my body as Megatron shot Prime repeatedly, then fall down speachless when Prime died.... So why only for stars, that answer is simple... Prime died."
negative,"Numbingly bad.: Only in this, the age of mediocrity, could a piece of rubbish like this get made. Owen Wilson turns in one of the worst performances in recent memory. This was made strictly for the idiots who find MTV worthwhile part of our culture."
positive,"READ IT!: Ugh. all these adults. this is a KIDS BOOK, people. and sure, the beginning's a little weak, but the plot becomes terrific and exciting and epic and great and you get my point. what all you adults who think you're the only people who read this book *choughchough*, are saying is that this is a ripoff, but it's NOT. please. just read it. PLEASE!P.S. Eldest is so gooooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"Very Good: I am little prejudiced because I like Anne Hathaway. Therefore, I liked this movie very much. I liked the ""behind the scenes"" portion of the DVD as well."
negative,"Stanley Bostitch nailers: I have bought 3 Stanley Bostitch nailers / staplers now and they are alljunk. One of them double fires almost every time. The other two, thecheap plastic trigger has failed. I oil them every time I use them anduse S-B oil and neither one has more than 100 nails through it, but thetrigger simply does not work. I would never buy another and I wouldn'trecommend this brand to anyone.rt"
positive,"Liked it: I think Izzy is very talented and I'm glad he's using his talent for Kingdom music. I didn't always feel like he gave his all in every song but the lyrics were great and a few songs really caught my ear. I can't say that it's my favorite cd, but I think it's a great way to round out any Christian's cd collection. I hope to see more from this artist."
positive,"A must read for those who love Indian romances.: 1877 - South Dakota to MissouriCassie Edwards' love for Indian romances is very apparent! I get the impression her heart and soul is poured into each romance she writes. THUNDER HEART like her others, is a revealing, honest, and romantic look at Indian history.Thunder Heart's band has been named Musti-Ponca (Warm Ponca) because the white man has moved his tribe to Missouri. On the trip his loss was tremendous, and now as they sit and wait on the white man, his chieftain father and his people are ill. Dede and her son Johnny first learn of the Ponca's existents when they hear the haunting songs of the tribe. Bill who lives with Dede in name only is out to seek revenge on the Indians for his painful loss. As he and others make destructive plans against Thunder Heart's tribe, Dede makes plans of her own.Ms. Edwards paints the canvas of her romance with some colorful characters, interesting historical facts, and a steamy romantic moment or two."
positive,"Bostitch LHF97125-2 Hardwood Flooring Stapler: This is a great little tool for installing flooring. I installed about 1200 ft^2 of oak floor without a single jam, leak or damage to the floor. The tool just goes and goes. It's fast and easy to use. Great product."
positive,Old Favorite: I saw this movie when I was a child and just fell in love with Elsa the lion. When I found it was on DVD I had to purchase it. It is a classic and if you love animals you will love this movie.
negative,"Disappointing and shallow account of the ordinary heros WWII: I was quite let down by the lack of real substance and information in the accounts. It is a great subject but the shallow treatment did not hold my interest. Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers is much, much better."
negative,"THIS BECAME A CLASSIC?: Little Women has a very weak plot, going back and fourth between what the character is thinking and what is actually happening.This book also completely lacked amusement! It talked and talked and talked, about NOTHING!!!! It absolutly moved to slow and when the book finally started getting faster, so much had changed in the story!There are much better classics out there! DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK!!!"
negative,"Worst... Rod... Stewart... CD...EVER: Clearly, Rod Stewart is one of rock's best vocalists. Unfortunately, you'd never know it from listening to this CD of pure drivel and sap. This is one of those excruciating projects where everything went wrong. The bad choice of material (not necessarily bad songs at all, just bad songs for Rod to sing), lackadaisical production, and indifferent vocals from Rod all add up to one of the worst listening experiences you'll ever endure if you decide you have to have it. The only positive purpose this CD could serve is as an interrogation tool, but it would probably violate the Geneva Convention rules against torture."
negative,"Disappointed!: I was expecting more about Julie's experiences making and eating the recipes of Julia. What I got was a disjointed and profanity laden book which had little to do with Julia's recipes. Not being a prude by any means, I enjoy profane humor - if done with style however Julie seemed to use profanity more for the shock value. Over all the book was disappointing and since I don't like to waste time it won't get finished. On to the used book store!"
negative,Liver Cleanse Supplement: Did not use as my G.I. Dr. said that a recent study showed that they do not help.
negative,"Worst English dub of a great TV series: This sucked!The WORST English dub EVER!Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy. True fans of the manga and series should NOT buy this lame production by Funimaiton."
positive,"The road to Hobbiton: This is a classic, a must read for anyone who loves fantasy. From start to end, the Hobbit never seases to amaze and delight. With a cast fo characters, ranging from Gandolf, a wizard to Smaug, a dragon, the reader is taken through the ups and downs of the adventure.I would have to say that my favorite part was where Gollum was challenging Bilbo, the hero of this book, to a game of riddles. Here is where the real story begins as Bilbo finds a ring, that Gollum refers to as his precious.This is the best written and thought of book of its kind. A must read for anyone. I give it four stars."
negative,"Is it ""Alpha"" or ""Image"" ?????: I really want to get this movie, but am a bit confused as to which version I will get.I have the IMAGE copy bookmarked, but when I got to review details it shows the cover of the Alpha copy !!ALPHA is notorious for putting out the worst pieces of Chit on DVD.How is the Image version ?????"
positive,"Douglas Adams does it again!!!!: Douglas Adams has done it again. In this sequal to Dirk Gently, are goos old detective is out to solve another baffling case. Adams takes every thing in this book and makes it make sense in the end. One of his best. As humorus as Dirk Gently but with it's own twists. Adams is one of the BEST writers in the world and and can make anything a good read. What are you doing sitting here reading what I have to say. ORDER THIS BOOK. You won't be disappointed. I wasn't"
negative,"Booooooooring: I'm a senior in high school, and Mill on the Floss was the most boring book I've ever read. Every guy in my English class despised it, and only a few girls liked it. It takes over one hundred pages for Eliot to get started, and she lacks direction throughout the book. Even an experienced reader is left asking, ""What's your point?"" It seems as though she tries to say too much (or really never knew what she wanted to say), and it all gets jumbled and garbled into essentially nothing--and she does it all in only 600 pages. If you have to read it for school...I'm sorry. If you're thinking about reading it for pleasure, there are plenty of better books to read."
positive,Excellent with the tiniest problem!: Works like a charm. I spent almost $4 on the same thing I'd have had to pay $50 for if GameStop was the only option. But thanks to this I paid what a TV cable is really worth.One occasional problem that happens approximately once a week is that the screen and the sound go away for about 2 seconds but very very rarely. I was going to give it a 4 star because of this but it's not as big of a deal to me. Definitely recommended...
negative,"Extremely repetitive, needed a haircut: I mean, 2.5 hours? Really? The story line is so simple, this could easily have been a taut 90 mins and we all would have been a lot happier. I actually have not seen the first two in this series, so this only starts to make some limited sense after a long while. Anyone should be able to watch, though, and get it, thus the editing here needed more work. The absurdly plumped up lips of the girlfriend continuously transfixed me, way more than the silly transformer action fight sequences. Speaking of which, that is where all the fat is here. The fighting could have been seriously cut and no one would have complained except maybe the kids who made this comic book movie. Is anyone surprised to learn that the bad guys/good guys theme ends with the good guys in charge, yet again?"
negative,"Good action shots but a pitiful storyline that yawns: 2.5 Stars because the action scenes are great, but the plot is simplistic and the semblance at drama pathetic, with irritating stabs of shallow sentimentalism and worn cliche. Worth renting but not worth buying unless you want good action shots and are a Van Damme fanatic. I will sell my DVD if I can. A previous review compares this to Glory, but I consider the comparison far-fetched, unless action is the sole criteria."
negative,"Fantasies of the Past: I agree with the other reviewer that this book is dated in the light of later studies, esp. in archaeology and more critical examinations of historical sources. The sole reason for its revival is the current demand for books with an Islamic theme. Otherwise this book would be next to useless. It is more fantasy than fact."
negative,"LESS OF THE SAME: Higgins doesn't break a sweat with this one. If you have read Higgins' other books with Sean Dillon as the protagonist there's is no need to read this one. Same story elements, same set piece action scenes and so on. Maybe I have read one too many of his books but they are all very much blending together now. Even the name of the book is unoriginal, note his earlier ""Touch the Devil."" Harmless enough few hours of reading but not much is new."
positive,"10 month old LOVES this DVD.: I love this DVD because my 10 month old loves it. We have to watch it at least two times in a row when we watch it (she fusses when it goes off, ha). She was familiar with a few of the songs, but now she hums and clap to all the songs. This is the only show that holds her attention since she enjoys watching kids. Sesame Street rocks!!!"
positive,"Many Reviewers AreToo Young to Understand: It seems that most of the negative reviews listed here are from young readers. It's unfortunate that this book is assigned to students too young to appreciate and understand it. This book was required summer reading prior to my entry into Jr. High School and I really didn't think much of it at the time. Many years later, with some life experience under my belt, I reread this novel and found so many things that were not evident to me as a 12 yr old forced to read it for school. So - to all of you young readers (and teachers) - it's too bad you're forced to read stuff before you're old enough to appreciate it - try to keep an open mind and don't be turned off to some the classic of literature."
negative,"I'm glad I didn't BUY it!: This was a gift -- requested and much anticipated. I'm sorry my son wasted his money on my behalf. Yes, I'm a ""foodie,"" and foodies are going to be as disappointed as I was in this book. I'm also an avid reader, and the premise of this book was irresistable. Ugh! I had to force myself to finish it. It had absolutely nothing to do with food, as I know and love it; it was all about the author, her dysfunctional husband/friends, her wretched living conditions, and her frequent alcoholic binges. Julia Child (whom I met more than once in my youth, since she was an acquaintance of my mother) was right to wash her hands of the whole thing. I'm donating my copy to the library. I would NEVER pass it along to a friend!"
negative,"Protofeminist Psychobabble--Not Worth Your Time: I tried giving it a shot but the book is (1) not sexy, as it is marketed, (2) about a lurid main character/narrator whom I can't follow, (3) filled with 1970s-style Freudian psycho-bull that attempts, amateurishly, to explain gender roles and relations, and (4) very solipsistic. It doesn't seem at all like fiction but the bickerings of a sexually frustrated woman who thinks too much about herself and who doesn't seem to be all that bright but manages to parade under some kind of feministic pseudo-intellectual banner. I just found the narrator despicable and didn't finish the book. I can't believe it has such a high review on Amazon, which means, I guess, that the majority of people reading it in 2011 are people who are already sympathetic to the book or author.Don't bother. If you want sex pick up Anais Nin or Zane or Philip Roth--anything else that has a story or good prose style, just not this."
positive,STILL APPROPRIATE TO TROUBLED YOUTH 30 YEARS LATER: TODAYS TROUBLED YOUTH CAN RELATE TO PIRI'S EXPERIENCE. I HAVE READ THIS TO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY ARE AMAZED THAT IT WAS WRITTEN 30 YEARS AGO. A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO WORKS WITH TROUBLED TEENS.
positive,Sacrificed Lives: I thought the book was very good and I looked forward to finding out the ending. I did not like that one of the main characters was killed off very early in the story but the writer did go on from there with the other characters.
negative,"disappointing: I read this book primarily because it is known as a ""classic"" piece of environmental literature. In my opinion, it does not deserve to be considered as such primarily because it is shallow. The basic message that there is value in wilderness for its own sake is obvious. Maybe it was not apparent in the fifties but is obvious now. In terms of preservation, Abbey does not offer any insights other than: stop building roads, stop population growth, keep things as they were in good old times when there was nobody around and i could build fires anywhere i wanted, throw tires in the Grand Canyon, and cut down trees if i felt like it. Not much of an insight."
negative,"Constant Rash: Great price for this product, but it caused both of my kids to have rashes. I ended up going out and buying another kind to mix with them so the rash would subside enough that we could use the diapers without wasting money and having to throw them away. These also don't have elastic in the back waistband of the diaper...another really nice feature in other brands."
negative,"Gauges in chair arms: Chair is the product ordered, however it came with gauges in the arms. The chair was well packed and the damage appeared to have happened at the factory before wrapping for shipment. Poor quality control. Not worth returning the product. Other than that, the bench is substantial and as promised. I have pictures taken while I was unwrapping, but couldn't figure out how to include them."
negative,Incrediby difficult to put on: With the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it's really difficult to put on. You need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the 20 some odd hooks.
negative,Worth Reading - Barely: I am a veteran of WWII and was very disappointed in this book. It is totally devoid of emotion. Brokaw generates no real sympathy for his characters and the result is much like reading a dull history book filled with statistics. With the subject matter available he should have been able to bring many tears to the eyes of the reader. I suggest Brokaw read Flags of Our Fathers to discover what real writing is all about.
positive,"Fabulous Reading: The Boston Globe 7/3/2003 ran a picture of Lauralee and a long story.Immediately I grapsed the significance of her plight and wish others would recognize her life toil for what it is: pure hardship, almost unbounded.I love this author, I would love to see more people in her situation write about their lives.We are truly enriched."
negative,"Come on.............: We know Back in Black was one of the best albums in history...do we really need some ""experts"" to tell us this ??I'm a big AC/DC fan I would not buy this...."
negative,"Don't buy the dvd, and don't buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews: I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed. It has nice surf footage, but the yoga instruction is really bad. The time would have been better spent slowing going through each yoga pose, versus racing through a large number of poses. Skip this DVD, take a lesson at your local yoga place."
negative,don't see this movie: this movie is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. It would have probly been better if you could hear the words the people were saying half of the time. And don't use any of that i am shallow i don't get it ... because i get alot of things and i find depressing movies with hard to follow storylines easy to understand. but this is awful. it has no point and if you buy it you would surely be wasting your money. the music is awuful and the plot is teriible. i can understand why some people gave it bad raitings but not why some gave it good ones. do not buy this movie or watse you money on renting it. I am saving you from a huge dissapointment. I wish i could have gieven it zero stars.
negative,"merchandise problem: Although I am sure that Cuisinart has a good product, I ordered the HENKEL set of cookware. It was a gift and, when the Cuisinart cookware arrived, I did not go to the effort of returning the item. When I first realized the problem, I wrongly assumed that Cuisinart owned HENKEL. Recommendation - be very careful, if you are ordering HENKEL cookware through AMAZON."
negative,"Great Pictures, but can't get them off the camera: I love the pictures this thing takes. Some of them look like they were taken by professionals for national geographic. But they were just pictures of my cat.But I have a HUGE problem with the PC interface. You have to use Kodak's software to transfer to a PC. With my olympus, I just hooked in the USB cable, went to My Computer, found the camera, then dragged and dropped the photos where I wanted them. No large programs to load, no creating albums, no setting default options, etc. Just drag and drop using the windows explorer interface. The so called ""easy""share software won't allow that.So I find myself using my old olympus, because after all, I'm just taking pictures of my cat."
positive,Love it!: I am very happy with the weight and quality of this product. I wear this necklace often and love it!
positive,"Wallflowers continue the miracle...: Everyone think that the succes of Bringing down the horse was insurmontable. But The Wallflowers sign another excellent album, a very good album, not better than the first album, but it's a mature album. It's a very good album, so slow but ... everyone as found what the search on this New album by The Wallflowersa an Jacob Dylan..."
negative,Only lasted 3 months: I've purchased this item since it had a high rating but it's been only 3 months and it's NOT WORKING. I'll never buy X-Acto product ever again!!
positive,"Listen up!: I know my 4 star rating won't bring up the average, but I just have to beat down the primatives a little. No, this wasn't a great movie. But it had more action than any other Musketeer film out there. And if everyone hadn't already slamed it for being ""Hong Kong"".....I would just say that it was just really well corriagraphed. Sure the younger actors are, let's say, in need of experience, But their performances were sincere if a little naive. And, would everyone please stop comparing remakes to what they think are originals. The Lester films of the Seventies were remakes too, and bear more resemblance to Monty Python than to Dumas. And that's another thing....Dumas was no great writer, just a very popular pulp fiction author of his day.THE MUSKETEER stands on it's own with a very capable director showing us HIS view. To sum up....good action, witty dialog, a super villian.....a keeper. (Michael York....talk about wooden!)"
positive,"""People Time"" is a great swan song for a great player.: Although, as stated in previous reviews, Stan was battling lung cancer at this time, ""People Time"" is that much more poiniant and amazing for it. Stan is playing straight from the soul, and Kenny Barron plays brilliantly. In a duo such as this, someone needs to set the tone - and both players do a magnificent job. Recorden in Sweeden, the audience knows exactly what variety of genious they are witnessing, and again, being LIVE, the stakes and the history are always boiling under the surface. Stan's renditions of ""East of The Sun..."", ""I Remember Clifford"", ""Surrey..."", and ""Stablemates"" are my highlights. I simply can not get enough of this one, and I go to it time and time again. A real classic."
positive,"This movie rules!: I don't know why everyone keeps dissing this movie, I thought it was great! Sure, it's a little weird, but that's what makes it so cool! It has everything, comedy, romance, action...what more could you want in a movie??? If you are into fantasy stuff, like I am, you'll like this movie! (Ps, whoever keeps refering Jet Li as a karate expert better shut up! he does KUNG FU for the last time!)"
positive,"Reader From Reading, PA: I liked this book, but there were alot of things in it, that I just skipped over, that did not capture my interest. But all in all it was good enough for me to loan it to people who I thought would get some use of it, like when she describes about being in the void and a few other things. Not a bad book at all."
negative,"If You saw this movie, I pity you!: This is a Bad movie from start to finish.Perhaps the trend of tranfering comix books into big screenmovies has begun to play itself out. And its time for Hollywoodto find some fresh material to use.In my estamation this movie was poorly concieved and directed. I've have read one or two of the Hellbound books. They arefairly good. (If your into catholic guilt that is!)But sometimes whats just so so on paper, can be really goodon film. I was hoping this would be so with Constantine.Sadly I was mistaken. Keanue Reeves performance was nothing more that a wise cracking version of his charicter in the Matrix.I have two suggestions.1.Save your money and buy or rent much better movies.Such as the oringinal 60's film ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harrisand Claire Bloom. or ""Rosemarie's Baby"" with Mia Farrell.Or the overlooked mid 70's flick ""The Sentinal"".2.Please Keanue, find yourself some better roles. and get outof the ""Matrix""!"
negative,"A real disappointment: After reading this book, I am very surprised that this author won the Nobel Prize. I did not find this book ingenious; I found it ponderous and laboured. The idea behind the story is intriguing, but the potential is never realized. The style of writing is such that the reader must really work to follow what is going on. In my case, the story and the protagonist were not sufficiently interesting to warrant such effort."
negative,"Same problems as previous review: I have had this router/gateway for the past year.Since then, it has basically stopped working for any kind of long transfer between two wireless devices (i.e. more than 50Mb sustained.) The router will completely crash; while the lights still flash, 802.11b and 10Base-T connections do not transit data.I called their customer support line and was treated extremely rudely. They basically said it was my problem and too bad.I will never buy another Netgear product again. A shame, as they used to have much better hardware and support (then again, this was back in 1999...)"
positive,Subscribe and save is awesome!: This product is delivered almost instantly after placing your order. The no mess packaging is convenient and environmentally friendly. No extra (and pointless) boxes to throw away.
positive,Hard to Kill: A man awakens from a seven year coma and seeks revenge on the men who left him for dead and murdered his family. Steven Seagal is one of the best martial-artist to ever come to the big screen with the moves he performs. Great movie.
negative,"A Grave Mistake: This is one bad film. It has all the style and charm of a 1970 porno flick but with none of the benefits. Okay there me sex and violence, but is that enough? As that isn't even done well I saw no. All in all this is one Nasty Video."
positive,"Live From Las Vegas Review: I highly recommend this CD to everyone who remembers when these Artists appeared in Las Vegas and around the country. The songs keep your foot tapping and aside from being very enjoyable, consider the songs on this CD, ""History"" in a new generation who are forgetting the basic music of this CD which gave all newer music their start."
positive,"Very emotive.: A touching story of a retired couple who had lived through the blitz, and think WW3 will be the same ""for king and country"", ""give Jerry a thrashing"" followed by victory parades and street parties type of war. They receive a very rude awakening.Have a box of Kleenex handy. Not ""The Snowman"", not for younger children.Read the book, and see the film."
negative,"Great compilation inferior audio quality: I bought this compilation because it's filled with so many great songs. It even has some of Smokey's solo tunes. I am however disappointed with the ""remastering"" of a couple of key tracks on the first disk. Both Oh Baby Baby and The Tracks of My Tears sound terrible on this compilation. I'm sure there is some high quality recordings of these two songs out there. If audio quality is important to you pass on this particular comp."
positive,"""Wait and Hope"": ""All human wisdom is summed up in two words-wait and hope"".(Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte-Cristo). That is not enough to live but it helps one survive and life is based on surviving. Hopes and dreams of happiness crushed for Edmon Dantres on the day they were supposed to come true, every single one of them. But he beat prison, he beat death, he beat all his misfurtunes, he became bigger-that-life, the Count of Monte-Cristo, just to get his revenge to all those who broke his life.This is a novel about a man whose only goal became revenge but was it the right thing to do? This book is not too deep but it has some kind of sense of exitment that keeps you reading every single page."
positive,"Lovely: We are presented a letter from ""Sam"" and it takes a while to figure out just what relationship is the focus of the letter. Lovely, lovely story."
negative,"The rhythm is wrong; big disappointment: I love Connie Francis in Italian, so I thought I would like this CD. And it's not her accent in Spanish that bothers me, it's the rhythm. I don't know if it is the fault of the arrangers or of Connie herself, but her boleros don't sound like boleros. If you want to hear an English-speaking singer who got it right, listen to Nat King Cole in Spanish! His accent is terrible, but his phrasing and sense of the Latin beat are perfect!"
negative,"I couldnt finish it: I know its an old movie, so I shoulnt be too harsh on it. I bought it because the premise was interesting to me. But this movie was so boring to me I couldnt even finish watching it. I literally stopped it, took it out, and put a different movie in. Maybe its because theres no talking in it. The early humans are portrayed more as apes. I have no problem with this as I do believe in evolution, but it just made for a boring movie. I think if a larger budget movie with a similar concept was done today, it would be great. Maybe someday when I'm in the right mood, I'll try watching this again."
negative,"Yawn...: I took the gamble and purchased this CD because of some of the positive reviews that it was given. I'd never heard of Morphine but it felt like it was a worthy risk. I gotta admit I was disappointed. I just couldn't find much substance in the lyrical or instrumental composition. I listened to it many times hoping that I might discover some subtle appeal, but nuttin...I found it empty and boring."
negative,"Couldn't Finish It...: I began reading Steve Berry's books in order. The first two were fine. The Third Secret was just absurd. I got almost to the end and just gave up. Very rarely will I not finish a book once I get into it. I can overlook some implausability and use my imagination when reading, but this was just too far. I thought Dan Brown's Demons & Angels was pretty farfetched at the end, but The Third Secret is even worse. I am not particularly religious, so it wasn't that I was offended by the book. I stopped reading Mr. Berry's books for quite some time after this book. I finally decided to pick up with his next book, which is much better so far.I recommend this author, in general, for some light, entertaining reading, but skip this installment."
positive,"Highly intellectal and emotional multi-plotted story.: What can one say about such a powerful story? Is it about love? Is it about irony? Is it about lust? Is it about loss? What is it all about? That, in my view, is the beautey of this film: Nobody is for sure, yet most everyone knows that it's a classic.Brando gives the performance of a lifetime. For those who want to know what real acting is, I recommend they see the scene with Brando and his dead wife's body. It's majestic, to say the least.In this film, Brando lets himself go and seems to let the viewer inside his mind - if not soul.The musical score is passionate, lustful, erotic and majestic all at once. It's wonderful.Bertulluci was creating a sure winner here when he was directing. He shows what a talented director he truly is.I advise anyone to see this film 3 or 4 times. With each viewing, the viewer will get more of an insight into the mind of one terribly lonely man. It's a masterpiece!"
positive,Surprised Wife: Mackie By Bob Mackie For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 OuncesGood product. Good price. Good service. Goodby.
positive,"LOL: Not usually a fan of British humor, but this was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. My hubby and I were on a plane when we started to watch it and had people in the surrounding 10 rows wonder what the hell we were laughing so hard about. A must see!"
negative,no: just no. not even close to being listenable. its as annoying as listening to japanese anime before its been dubbed.
negative,"horrible printing job: Excellent book, however the printing company has done a horrible job. They have not left enough space between the binding line and the words and one needs to struggle with every page to be able to read the book. Such a disrespect to this masterpiece and the author. Amazon should refuse to sell defected books of that sort to its clients. Shame on ACE printing company for doing such a lousy job."
negative,One of the worst I have ever seen: Do not buy or rent this. Adam Sandler is officially a no talent hack. This is not for children or anyone for that matter unless lame brained scattological humor with absolutely no point is your thing.
negative,"Lots of leaks, not the same as Dry Max: BEWARE!!! Just because the box looks like Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max Diapers, these are NOT the same. My son is now 5 mo. old and we've been using Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max diapers since he was born (you know, with the blue wetness indicator on the front). However, these are NOT Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max. These are thinner, do not have the woven material inside the diaper and are not nearly as absorbent as the Swaddlers. My son has leaked out of his diaper the last 5 nights... these diapers simply are not absorbent enough to contain a night's worth of pee. We rarely had this problem with Dry Max. I won't be buying these again- they simply aren't worth the very little cost savings."
positive,"Cute! Light reading but a lot of fun.: For those not familiar with black America this is a great introduction--especially into the whole hair issue. (You cannot understand a black woman if you don't understand black hair and all its issues). If you are already clued in, then this is a great little vignette on a set of topics that can loom quite large in the lives of many black American women--hair, skin colour, and the quest for a decent man.I enjoyed this book a lot. I read it in one sitting, way into the wee hours of the morning, because I couldn't put it down. I since lent it to my sister who got a message of self-empowerment out of it. She then lent it to a friend who loved it, and it is now in the hands of a friend of hers!That said, this is not capital L Literature, but it is fun."
positive,Two Highways: This movie is a timeless classic. Jessica Rabbit is still one of the hottest actress in cinama to this day. Excluding Alyson Hannigan and Linda Cardellini. Christopher Lloyde shows he has true gritt.
negative,"Don't buy this version it is DUBBED for the America Market: It is unfortunate that this film was ever DUBBED. It is not as though Aussies speak another language and Yanks aren't intelligent enough to work some the careful crafted slang in this classic.Fortunate now there is a new UNDUBBED version due for release this mouth, with more features and CHEAPER.I'm selling my old DUBBED copy and buying the new UNDUBBED version."
positive,"It is worth trying it... I recommend!: This product has considerably increased my milk production! Its taste is strong, but it works. I will now try the version without alcohol. I hope it keeps working."
positive,Replacement Lithium-ion Battery for Motorola V551/V555 / V557: This battery is excellent. The battery is better then the new one that came with the phone.
negative,"Could not finish: I was not expecting this to be great literature or anything, but I at least thought it might be a breezy, fun summer read. I was wrong. This book is SO tedious. I found myself skipping entire sections, hoping that the story would pick up. It never did, and I finally put it down around page 50 or so. Powell is just not a good writer at all. Blogging about dinner is probably right up her alley as a writer. I saw the movie which was thankfully much, much better. The movie took out all the parts of the book that just didn't do anything for me, like her brother ""Heathcliff"" and her dad's birthday dinner. As a reader, you wonder why she includes all that stuff. It just seemed like ""filler"" to me."
positive,"A great listen....: This cd is a great listen, I really enjoy the ""How Soon is Now?"" cover (an old the smiths song). There is a few flaws in there english songs but they are obviously new to the language and I wish Lena and Julia could express themselfs more through the english language when it comes to the enhanced movies on there CD but they run into there language barrier.It does seem that they are a heavily produced duo on stage and off but there is so many pop acts in America currently that are worse so I don't see this as much of a problem since they are both young and need direction til they can find there own musical journey to take. Hopefuly as there english learning progresses and they can express themselfs more through lyrics and interviews they will be a fantastic act to watch in the future.Good luck breaking through into the USA, it is a tuff journey and I hope you plot it well else they will become a one-hit-wonder in America."
positive,"Nice: The quality of this products is very nice, the item is original, not is copy. The color is great and it is new item.The time to travel and bla bla is accepted"
positive,"Better than Zagat's: good fun and useful. i really agree with what they say about places. they tell me about the restaurants, good and bad, not themselves. covers lots of places out in the neighborhoods. maps are useful for finding places. it's nice looking, too."
positive,TYKES: My child is 4yrs old and is REALLY into video games. With pure triumph to win a game. Alot of games are not made for the youngins. He is able mess with this game longer than five or more minutes. I as an adult don't enjoy it but he gets hours of pleasure.
positive,"Braveheart VS Gladiator, a dead heat..: I never thought I'd see a movie as good as Braveheart. But Gladiator is just as good if not better. I bought the DVD today at Best Buy for $14.99 (los angeles). The first time I saw this movie was at the movie theatre. No other movie, especially one as long as Gladiator, has held my attention by the second. I sat on the edge of my seat throughout. My girlfriend liked the movie, however, not as much as me. Go figure, I don't picture this movie to be a ""chick flick"" anyway.This movie is well worth the price. I would have spent more if I had to."
negative,"Not a revolutionary idea: ""ChiRunning"" is not a new idea. This running method has beendescribed and advocated by Dr.Nicholas Romanov since 1977 as a pose method of running. Visit his website; [...]. It is very annoying to see the description of ""ChiRunning"" a revolutionary idea by simply attaching ""Chi"" to the pose method [...]. ""Chi"" part of this book is very superficial."
negative,"Beware! You're buying old inventory!: When new, these were great, but everything being offered for sale now has been sitting on the shelf for a very long time, years in fact. Batteries this old cannot be charged up again. You're just buying a paperweight!"
positive,"The New Voice: Clay's debut cd is a fine first effort. However, it would have been a steller debut had more of the songs sounded a little more different from each other. At first listen it was hard to know when one ended and one started. Also, I was hoping for at least one roof shattering over-the-top showcase for that powerful voice of his. The single ""Invisible"" is a great pop song that deserves to be heard on radio, but I think mainstream radio may not embrace it due to the current hip hop domination and there is not a rap artist to be found. AC radio should add it without hesitation though. With all that said, this cd is definately worth a listen. He has a great future."
negative,Frustrating: My son received this for his birthday and my normally laid back and quite handy husband was never so frustrated in his life putting a toy together. After the 3 or 4 hour labor of putting the thing together the toy would not work properly and my 3 year old son kept crying because he couldn't get the doors or elevators to work. Overall it was a terrible experience and we can't even get the thing back in the box to return it.
negative,Bummer: If you have crooked teeth like me - be alert - it really doesn't work because the strips won't stay on the whole 1/2 hour.
negative,"Disappointed: Just opened to get ready for christmas and was disaapointed. No remote, as discribed, no instructions to get the pictures to fit ""full"" frame. RETURNING this frame. Went and got a similar frame for 10.00 more and just put the SD card in and I had to do nothing. A review below tells you how to size your photos, but what a hassle. This frame will be my first return to Amzaon after many purchases."
positive,The Rabbi's Cat is the cat's meow!: This book came highly recommended to me by my Rabbi's husband. I was not disappointed! I think everyone will love this illustrated novel.Jorma
negative,"Meretricious Dreck: The only impressive thing about this overblown and self-important film was that the director was able to get it released with easily an hour of totally disposable footage and scenes included. That must have taken some doing. Otherwise, it is totally undistinguished: hackneyed, false, and tasteless."
negative,Songs on the soundtrack which don't belong to the film!: I bought this soundtrack and was very surprised about the collection of the songs. I missed some of the film. Others were performed by other artists. And some have nothing to do with the film. I think they were put on the CD to fill the disk!
negative,"The dregs of ATDI finally crash and burn.: Of the two bands that ATDI splintered into, it should be obvious at this point which one is actually worth listening to. The Mars Volta makes intelligent, frenetic, insane polyrythmic guitar-prog music, while Sparta have found their niche in the world of tepid, whiney radio rock.There's nothing interesting about this album. There are songs that are slightly catchy, but nothing well written or particularly original. Even the cover looks stupid. Waste your money elsewhere."
positive,Mickey Dolenz Plastic Symphony: I like this CD . It is very short though and only has about five of Micky's songs on it. If you like the Monkees and Micky it will be a good addition to add to your collection.
negative,Not a good reference book for home inspectors.: We have a home inspection business and I read many books on real estate topics. This book was OK but certainly not worth recommending to our inspection clients. Some of the topics discussed are irrelevant to home inspections - such as mold! There were many topics lacking in the amount of information the author provided. Maybe if you don't know anything about houses or construction you might learn a little bit from this book. If you have a novice level of knowledge about house inspections then you should buy a different book since this book won't teach you anything new.
positive,Multiplying learning help: I bought this to help my grandchildren learn to multiply better. I hope it works. It will if they actually use it. It shows a problem and when you press the key it will give you the answer. The idea is to guess the answer before you push the button. I'm crossing my fingers that it will help and that they will have fun using it.
positive,workout: loved the dvd thanks Amy!! Hoping to be toned and firm by the end of this Summer!! If you enjoy step areobics you will enjoy this DVD check it out!
positive,"helpful for travelers: we used some pertinent phrases on our recent trip toFrance, so it was instantly helpful, plus entertaining."
positive,"Classic by Tolkien in hardcover: Ever since I was first swept away by this book when I was in 4th grade, I've had a soft spot for Tolkien's works. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings inspired me to become an English instructor and travel the world in search of adventure. Now, with all the talk of a ""prequel"" movie based on The Hobbit, I decided to go back and read it again. For a children's book there is an amazing relevance and persistence of indelible imagery untouched by the decades. The story's moral lessons about the destructiveness of greed and avarice are needed in this era of Wall Street bail-outs and 21st century piracy. My used copy arrived in good condition, but without the charming dust jacket designed by Tolkien. My book just had a plain black cover with a big white inventory sticker that tore into the cover when I peeled it off! This rather disappointing experience has convinced me to avoid this seller in the future. Does anybody have a spare dust jacket they could send me?"
positive,"Loved it!: Reading the original version was great and disappointing. Don't get me wrong Wells has always been one of my favorites. But Hollywood has changed the story, quite a bit.It was a pleasure to read it as it was written."
negative,ok game: Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon is a ok game. kinda hard to figure out.hardly any instruction manual comes with the game only to tell you how to install the game. The game is partly confusing Activision could come up with a better way to make the game more simple. I been a Fan of Trump's for awhile.The gameplay is ok once you figure out how to play.I really didnt like the game that much because it was too complicated and time crawled in the game it could of went faster.
negative,waste of time: an insult to the buying public. no wonder few people under 35 know how they used to play.i'm surprised that their musical integrity would let this one out.
negative,"Good, except for the characters: I heard a lot about this book but when I actually read it I was not impressed. Everything in this book is great except the characters. They are overbearing and ridiculous. It is hard to read a book when you hate the characters."
negative,Tape was broken: I bought this tape and it did not even get through one viewing without it being eaten as it was obviously very worn.
negative,"I didn't catch the catch: This is a stage play! It isn't the novel.This may be a wonderful thing for high school drama departments, but it wasn't what I wanted.It may be that I'm just an idiot and missed the clear statement that I was buying ""Men at Arms _*THE PLAY*_"". Nevertheless, a stage play is not what I thought I was paying for."
positive,"Pretty dang good.: This game is cool and unique. The perfect stocking stuffer. BUt for the price, do not expect a genius or anything. I played the game in the store several times and was amazed that it was able to come up with random words of mine like hubcap. The coolest part was that it would ask these crazy questions to make me think it was lost, only to make fun of me and tell me what my word was. The downside was that when I got it home I stumped it 3 times in a row. Maybe it was the magic of the store. The problem comes in that it is hard to answer the questions sometimes because none of the answers fit your word. So you pick the best of the three, and it really does end up throwing off the game. Sorry to break it to you. It is a cool game though. As long as you stay with concrete things that are easy to answer."
positive,"Mortal Kombat Rules!!!!!!!!!: I own Mortal Kombat 1&2! And I think it's pretty cool for someone who likes Martial Arts! I also own the Mortal Kombat Soundtracks 1,2 and 3!"
positive,"Good book: Another account of the diemention of the dead, quite good. The world of this planets afterlife is not known to modern science,yet it will authors like this who make us all think."
positive,"Warriors, NP: Starlight: An alright, but still worthwhile read where the Clan cats find their home and a place to communicate with StarClan."
positive,"upbeat and offbeat: A.M. Homes's latest novel takes you on a roller coaster ride through the life of her protagonist, Richard Novack, as he undertakes a redemptive battle to, in effect, save his own life. Lost and without a connection to the world, he reaches out to the people around him whose lives he changes and is changed by. He ends up creating a network of individuals who represent the many facets of his life and hold the promise of a better future."
positive,"High Wizardry: This book is really great! How Dairine got the computer talking was weird and how she went to Mars! She got on a big computer chip, and got a weird friend with fourteen legs. I think this book is cool and a bit weird."
negative,"sloppy: The topics covered are generally clear, but there are numerous errors and typos. There are bonds missing in the organic chemistry section and at least one error that is of a seriously confusing sort."
negative,"You've got to be kidding me...: One of the more difficult to get through movies you'll experience in a long time. Do not be fooled by the ""Best Picture"" award. Most musicals feel a need to advance some hint of a plot either with - or between - the songs. Not this film. It simply enjoys its own awful songs too much to let the audience in on any sense of what is going on.And did they give Jennifer Hudson the Best Stereotype Award? In a one-dimensional role requiring exactly no range from an actress, she hit all the right notes. They give ACTING awards for being yourself in front of a camera now?Might be the worst ""Best Picture"" ever."
positive,"adidas: was not sure if it would have fit, but it did as i have a chassis form the f50.8 version. Thus far it feels good and i would definately recommend the use of this product"
positive,"Powerpack 600HD... great for small outings: Works perfect for running a ceiling fan w/lights in my gazebo. Quiet operation, good battery life, very portable, and I especially like the many outlets. Worth every bit of the price. The only bad thing was the radio (the only reason why 4 not 5 stars), it is worthless: crappy sound and cheap controls, but I didn't buy it for the radio."
positive,"A great classic: I remember reading this when I was young. I found it again on Amazon and bought it to share with my kids. A sci-fi classic! I would recommend this to all kids, young and young-at-heart."
positive,Taste Great: This is really nice to have when you just want something a little different. It makes drinking a cup of coffee step out of the ordinary.
negative,"What? It's not a spoof???: I wanted to see what Drew was doing 15 years ago. I thought this was a bad attempt at a horror spoof with no laughs. Now I know it was just a bad film with unintentional goofs everywhere. Oh well, show biz people have to learn their trade somehow. Glad I didn't pay."
negative,"Not Representative of 1967: If you want to understand and experience the music of 1967, buy ""Are You Experienced"" by Jimi Hendrix, or ""Disraeli Gears"" by Cream.The Beatles music of this era (in which they dressed like they were working at Disneyland on both Magical Mystery and Pepper) is generally pretty soft and orchestral. Pepper has its moments, but this one isn't worth the trouble."
positive,"Amazing!: It is amazing and very interesting. Walk into a room with 20 Questions and all ready people are asking? ""What is it?"". Then when they find out it occupies everys attention for hours. Each person wants to see if they can come up with something 20 Questions can't figure out. It is amazing."
positive,"Betcha can't watch just once----Mesmerizing: I have personally never been as captivated with a movie in my life. I heard about people watching it several times and just couldn't believe it. But then I saw it, went out and bought a DVD player and now have seen it at least eight times. Why do accomplished people in the present want to watch this again and again? Besides the fact that the movie is wonderful on many levels (acting, costumes, action, music(too evocative for words) sets, etc)and is layered thick with details missed on first and second viewing, there must be more. I think it could be a search for transcendence in a secular world where nothing is really worth dying for, especially not your self respect or honor. I know at least one judge who has seen it 20 times! Anyway, this is a must buy and a must see---again and again. Betcha can't watch just once..."
positive,"Very Nice Remote Contolled Tripod: I bought this tripod for video tapping an upcomming family wedding and have tried it a couple of times to get used to it. I like the the smooth operation of the controls on the handle. The panning operation is likewise acceptable. The telescopic locking legs work well, but are light weight and can rock a little during panning. The lightness is also a plus because it collapses into a small over the shoulder bag for easy toteing. One hand on the tripod for stabilization and one on the control handle during panning works well."
positive,"Almost two months later & This CD is still the best!: I bought this CD the day is came out. I still play it 3 or more times a day. My kids love and my 90 year old grandmother loves it. Clay's voice is really beautiful, it's to bad that you have Ruben fans on here trashing it just to make Ruben look better. How disapointing for Both Clay and Ruben. If you want to hear some music that is clean and will just put you in a good mood this is the CD to buy. I can't wait for his next CD to come out, I will be the first person to get one!"
positive,"""Helter Skelter"": the Kindle edition review: All of the good things said about ""Helter Skelter"" is true of the Kindle edition. What's more the Kindle edition has hyperlinked footnotes that actually work and take you instantly to Bugliosi's notes. But the trade-off is that with the Kindle edition THERE ARE NO PICTURES because of licensing issues. The print edition has lots of pictures, but many of the crime-scene photo's are censored."
negative,product had a problem: The strings wouldn't tighten. Not sure if it's worth paying more shipping to return it.
positive,*: Played game with 4 year old students- they loved it. It kept them guessing and were surprised every time.
negative,"Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, takes place in a futuristic society where reading books, or the written word, is against the law and if you get caught all of your belongings, house and all, get burned to the ground.Even though this book is completely unrealistic to our society and has firefighters burning down homes instead of saving them, it offers an insight to what live would really be like if there was no written word and if technology ruled our lives.Guy Montag, the main character and our look into the firefighting world, is a man content with his life and never thought of the right and wrong of his job until one day when everything goes wrong and he feels that his freedom is being oppressed.This novel contains some action and it better reading for an older reading audience but will be liked for years to come."
positive,"Perfect backup battery: Although it doesn't get use unless we're out long enough to need a second battery, this product is working just like the original and seems to be a completely legit cannon production (despite a few other reviews)."
negative,"Disappointing Finale to Holmes Series: Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce receive a desultory sendoff in their final Sherlock Holmes entry for Universal. Despite the efforts of director Roy William Neill and a good supporting cast, ""Dressed to Kill"" (1946) feels like a ""B movie"" throwaway with its flat scripting and recycled Frank Skinner music from ""Son of Frankenstein."" A dull end to a memorable series."
negative,Author obviously has NO idea: This book totally misconstrues the Catholic Faith. It takes the Bible itself out of context as well as all Catholic references. It is a sad display of untruth. For a true view of the Catholic faith read a good book like Catholism and Fundementalism By Karl Keating
positive,"No Brainer!: I chose this alarm because it was the easiest to use. Just plug it in and that's it. I have a gas fireplace and was told that I needed a carbon monoxide detector. Plugged into a regular outlet, it has a dim light to let you know that it's working and you can test the monitor at any time to make sure it's ""alarmed."" Hopefully, I'll never have to see how well the monitor works in an emergency but I feel safer knowing that I have one."
negative,"Wrong Book sent.: Sent me the 1986 version, not the one pictured. It was only volume 1 also which only covered words starting with the letters A-G."
positive,"Yes yes yes: Yes, yes, yes. Not a very classical Fitzerald, but very joyous, nery personal .... Beautiful!"
negative,"Great, if she wants aholes and wimpy men in her life: I'm a confident, well-rounded individual. An alpha-male, for sure. I respect and adore women for everything that makes them women. I've always said a man has two duties in life, to provide for his family and to know how to please his wife in the bedroom. I am a real man and the consummate gentleman. With that being said, if a woman tried to employ the tactics laid out in this book, I would drop her without a second thought. Real men are too smart for these games, and these tactics will either land a woman with an ahole who employs the same tactics or a man who would never stand up for her when it counted. This book is heavy on deceitful tactics and little else. The problem is self-esteem; and this book won't fix that. Not one bit."
positive,"loved Treasure Island: I may have read this im my childhood, but I honestly don't remember. I can say that, as an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's fascinating to see so many familiar elements of pirate lore, and then realize ""wait, this book is where that stuff originated!"". All in all, a wonderful read."
positive,"Excellent, albeit short, DVD presentation.: This is one of those ""it's about time"" DVD releases. The first season of ""Three's Company"" was a short one, given only six episodes. But it was wonderful to see them in their original colorful, vibrant presentations. The show stands the test of time and this is a must-own DVD for any classic TV fan.The only fault, naturally, is the lack of features and the small number of episodes. It might have worked better if they had combined this with season two and released a loaded collection next year. As it stands, season two will be released next year and I fully expect a five-star collection."
negative,"Slow, slow, slow. Not up to the hype.: I finally gave in and purchased the first novel of the 'Worldwar' series. A disappointment, to say the least. The premise was original, and Tutledove gives interesting insight into the military capabilities of the era... but it never quite took off."
negative,"TOTALLY USELESS!! READ THIS REVIEW: I bought 3 of these for myself and 2 co-workers. (so its not that I got a faulty one) All 3 of us used it and agreed they are useless. Your drink will stay luke warm at best.It does ""warm"" the bottom of the mug though, so technically it isn't false advertising.Thanks for another crap product China."
negative,"Unreliable.. Wears out >>>: I bought this item through Amazon. If you sit next to it you can tell by the smell that it's working slightly. But, it isn't real abundant and it wears out quickly. It's not as powerful as they claim. I would have bought a different cleaner and actually am looking for a different one to replace this one. I need something stronger. My room is only 10 X 10 that it is in...hardly can tell it works."
negative,"Burt most have needed the $$.: Great actor, absolutely terrible movie. So bad that it is almost funny."
positive,"The best book you should read, but don't in High School: Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come."
negative,"it doesnt play in the DVD: has some scratches , the box looks good , but a bad feed back , It doesnt play in the DVD"
positive,its as if I were reading the book itself.: I got the auido book cuz I didn't have time to read the book for my english report and exam. I listen to it for one week and did a great book report and did great on the final exam. I did better listen than reading.
negative,"Glad they were under ten bucks.: Save your money. The eargels split in two days. I used regular ear buds on the large size. They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality. If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping. I have no use for them."
negative,Didnt like it: I didnt like this movie all too much... I thought it would be great but whats so scarey about it? I guess in my young age I dont understand what its like to have satans child but I still thought it was dumb and not scary at all. I have watch alot of horror movies... ALOT! And this one shouldnt be one of them its not even scary... If you are looking for thrills and chills look somewhere else because this movie is purely made for people who are scared VERY easily.
negative,"Dissapointing: Not very offen I throw negative comments on a film, but unfortunately this one doesn't deserve better. I really expected a better job from Luc Besson. While trying to be defiant and innovative, this film falls into historical incongruence. In order to sustain his picture of an eschizofrenic Joan Of Arc, Besson modifies or distorts historical facts and events already proven. For any person who knows and/or respects Joan Of Arc, or is looking to learn more about her, this is the last source they should look into. On another hand, the performances leave to much to desire, starting with Milla Jovovich, who overplays too offen. The only one who stood up to his name was Dustin Hoffman, a good actor in a bad role. To defy the common beliefs and standards in general, be it on Joan Of Arc or on any other subject, is always good, but only as long as such opinions are based on facts, something that Besson forgot in this movie."
positive,"The battery that saved the wedding: With the new memory cards the digital cameras take HUNDREDS of pictures which is great .... until the message ""Low Battery""! This time I remembered four days before my son's wedding that I need a spare battery! Ran to the mall, to the electronics stores, but nobody had it. The answer was "" contact the manufacturer"". There was no time for that, except AMAZON.COM. Two days later arrived to my house! That's service! Of course I was able to take thousands of pictures and save my son's wedding!"
positive,"Good novel, bad book: This Island Earth, the novel, is indeed different from the movie in the second half -- better, in my opinion, although less special-effects-driven. I don't remember the movie explaining the title, either; Jones is comparing Earth to the Pacific islands in World War II where the fighting washed back and forth, and the inhabitants were dragooned into helping build airstrips and such for either side. Here it's a war involving numberless galaxies (where the movie's was just between two planets).The novel is good, but the book is terrible. Pulpless.com's typesetters put in more typos than Raymond F. Jones could have made in a couple of centuries of writing. And the editors let it all slip by. But I don't believe there was any mass-market paperback, so this is the only game in town."
positive,"Great, But Could Be More Comprehensive: The entries in this dictionary are great and informative, but it just seems like it could have had even more in it (plus, there are a few entries that probably didn't need to be in there such as Karl Popper, a great philosopher of science and all, but how much does he really affect critical theory?). Still, the smaller size does make it even more portable, which is kind of a plus, and for the amount of information that is in here it's totally worth the price."
positive,"american idol fan: I though this cd wasn't bad for a first one. I would too like to hear more of his voice, but it seems that no matter what songs he sings, it can melt you heart. I don't have any kids of my own, but this is the type of cd that anyone at any age can listen to without having to worry about the ratings. Good job. He will just get better and better with more experience.Oh and for those of you who are looking forward to Ruben's cd, I heard rumors about it that I'm not sure are true, but many of you might be dissapointed in that one too. I heard it was going to be alot of hip hop type songs and not the soul songs that everyone is expecting. I hope this is not true, but if the cd is anything like the song he sang at the concert, it will definately be more hip hop."
negative,"Very annoying humming sound - be sure it doesn't bother you: Basically a nice unit. Loaded with all the features you could ever want: plenty of optical zoom, digital stabilizer, very compact size, reasonable warranty, and good looks too.BUT...this camera has a VERY annoying buzzing/humming sound to it. I called Canon and they said it's ""normal for that unit."" Excuse me?Maybe for some people, the buzz is not annoying. But compared to my cheap, old 8mm, this is much, much noisier. I would recommend you try it before you buy it. Don't get wooed by the display models."
negative,"Warning - serious scholars only!: I have to warn any person who may be buying this for the artwork. As much as there needs to be a new book on the collection at the National Portrait Gallery, this book is sadly not that book.All. 912. pages.are. Black and white.NO COLOR!Why would they do this?! I saw this at a local bookstore and all but ripped it off the shelf in my haste to finally get my hands on this long awaited book. My jaw fell open as I flipped in growing dismay.The images are tiny, like postage stamps and only black and white! Only a true scholar would get any sort of benefit from this. And frankly, the internet could be used as a valuable reference tool for that at a lot cheaper price.There needs to be a book like this, 900 pages or so with at least 60 percent in color. The works of art demand that much to be appreciated fully. This is yet another one of those 'trick' art books in which you find a majority of black and white images, a real pet peeve of mine.Buyer beware."
positive,great: thanks for your dealing i will deal again and again with you because it was nice to deal with you
negative,"Description did not match the toy: This is the first time I have been compelled to write a review on Amazon. Here is what the description said: ""Baby can pull and watch pal slowly climb up with the music. "" This is NOT the product I received. You can yank on the toy as with any hanging toy but there was no slow climb like we had expected from the product description.In addition, I happened to go to Toys R Us a few days after I received the package and saw the EXACT same toy for HALF of the price listed here from the manufacturer. Needless to say, the overall experience was negative. The toy is fine but did not live up to the description or the price tag."
positive,"""F@#k it I've had enough, here's the truth"": The true story of Englands loudest band the Sex Pistols. Through interviews and raw concert footage the story of the Sex Pistols is told by the band members and the people who were there. I think any big Sex Pistols fan would not be disappointed by this film. Even if your not a fan I'm sure you'll like this film. To see the rise and fall of the Pistols was very cool to see. The thing that I did not like the film was that the Ramones and the Clash were not mentioned. The Ramones started the whole sound, and the clash and the pistols were like brothers. It all just seemed very odd to me. What I also didn't like with this DVD was the lack of features. You only have the trailer, director commentary and the documentary of the whole punk movement, which all that I thought was good but I just thought they should've added more interviews or more footage of shows, tv stuff, etc. If your a fan or not, this is for you."
positive,"Babe: Enough said.: One of the best baseball legend biographies I've read. It moved quickly, but thoroughly...a very enjoyable read. Although the term ""page-turner"" is cliché, that's what this is."
positive,"rimbaud himself would have loved this book: ""delirium"" is nothing less than a work of creative genius, and i personally would be reluctant to criticize it for being 'self indulgent' when reading it is the linguistic equivalent of dropping acid or shooting up. it is that intense. after you finish it you immediately want another book by reed, or at least i certainly did. the source of poetry is free subjectivity and imagination, and there are parts in this book that are truly transcendent poetically. reed is interested in rimbaud when he was the 'god of adolescence', the period in his life of total rebellion and artistic frenzy. he does a near flawless job of showing that while verlaine and his somewhat cruel and hateful companion may have had a physical and shallow emotional bond, rimbaud was far above him on the spiritual and intellectual plane. this is a necessity for any admirer of rimbaud and surrealism."
positive,"Good Picture-Great Audio: I was not so impressed with the video quality. It was a bit grainly, but better than the DVD copy. Blu-ray gives you the newer lossless sound that will rock your world. You will feel like you are in the bar.I recommend this because of the sound quality and it is worth the upgrade if you like this movie."
positive,"Quick, Fast, Perfect Condition: My order camer faster then I ever expected it too and the dvd was in perfect condition! It was exactly the way it was described! Thank You!!"
negative,"no likey: saw this on doc oz..this is dangerous stuff ,I threw it away after 2 pills no likey save your money and go to tastytrades...I will update this review ,I saw this on Doc .oz he said it was safe ,well it is not if you have asthma ,after 2 pills I could not breath ,also that 7 keto stuff is dangerous too.Be careful don't just trust anything anyone says is safe ,research it on your own..Dr. Oz should really explain side effect more . good luck"
positive,"Good Chip: I had been looking for a low-fat chip to go with non-fat salsa for a long time. These are wonderful. Not too salty, not too bland, and way crispy. Just perfect in every way!"
positive,Dandruff shampoo in a bar: This product does work. I found it as a treatment for tinea or for any yeasty skin problems. The bar form is very good for travelling when liquids could leak. It has a mild scent and cleaned well.
negative,"Give me an ending: A decent story that gets you to turn the pages. The problem is, there aren't enough pages. The story just ends leaving you in the middle of an action sequence. I don't like paying $8 for a book that leaves you forced to buy the next one in a series. I don't mind series (thought I'm not that much into them), but each book in a series should stand alone."
negative,"Do not buy :(: I did a lot a research prior to purchasing this car seat. At first when my son was just transitioning to the convertible seat this carseat was fine, except for it was VERY VERY hard to install (no matter what car/suv)As my son has grown he has quickly become to big. The straps are too short and they pinch him. He head piece is hard to adjust as well. I do like the color and the fabric has worn well. Overall I wish I had bought another car seat."
negative,"Kindle Version not in English: Apart from the quality of the play, the Kindle edition of this product is in the original Czech, but claims to be in English."
negative,"burned 3 times!: I bought this for my daughter last Christmas. She was so excited she started playing right away. Shortly after she said there was a glitch. 2 Frodo's would suddenly appear on the screen. I took it back, and since you can only exchange the item for the same item we did. Again the glitches. During battle the players would split and you'd have 2 Frodo's or Aragorn etc.. on screen. We threw it out. Later we found several on a discount rack, Spiro's, race cars and LOTR's. So I figure what the heck, third times the charm right? WRONG. The third one had glitches also. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Especially because it wasn't an all battle game. It has action and puzzle solving too. It just should have had the glitches worked out before it was marketed."
negative,"New Design Leaks: Loved the old design - my baby stayed dry through the night. Now, every morning he is soaked. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I didn't mind paying a premium price for the old design - it was phenomenal. The new design does not compare. I have switched to Luvs."
negative,"Awful: I couldn't finish this book. It just had nothing of value for me since I'm not rich, and I don't have any ""money issues"" such that this book could be of help to me. I sensed the author has some political views which differ from mine, and don't have any place in a ""self-help"" book like this."
negative,Not a 'SPORTS' walkman: This product is not typical of Sony quality. I can't believe that Sony can sell this product with a straight face. The problem is when you drop this walkman while running or excercising the batteries fly out and you lose all your preset stations. The clasp that holds the batteries in the radio is flimsy and not designed to sustain an average drop. The old Sony design use to have a heavy duty screw that locked the batteries in the walkman and you can drop it all day long without your batteries flying all over the place and losing your preset stations.Why did Sony re-design something that was already great ? There are many better Sports Walkmans out there. Don't buy this one.
positive,AN OUTSTANDING CD FROM START TO FINISH: WOW!! This cd is outstanding from start to finish! Every song is great! I can't even pick one song that i really don't care for. Good job Clay....your first cd is worth 5 STARS. Buy this today!
positive,"Love it!: Love it! Read some mixed reviews about it, but I find it to be great. Just have to check the water level every three or four days. Motor is effective and very quiet. Works really well for indoor use. Love it!"
positive,"u2 fans know true goods: bono wrote the story for this film years ago...in fact, in ""where the streets have no name"" video bono had a sign constructed behind them(facing the other way) that says ""million dollar hotel"". it's a sleezy hotel with a murder plot...very deep...very dark....the film has not been released in the states yet, as far as i know...but i'm excited to see it...it stars mel gibson as the police detective....the soundtrack is great....but keep in mind it is not a u2 release...it is a soundtrack that sets a mood for a movie...i think it is very well done...any bad reviews(like from aoliveira) come from people who aren't true fans and don't know quality when they see it....check out ""passengers"" soundtrack music released by u2 years ago...very moody...very edgy...then you'll understand."
negative,"Hrm..: Growing up, I played both Moon Patrol and Spy Hunter in the arcades, then on the Atari 2600 console and Atari 800XL computer. The Spy Hunter reminds me of the Atari 800XL version of Spy Hunter, slightly easier than the 'real thing' but still awkward to get your car moving fast enough to be effective, but slow enough to give you time to react to things coming down the road (typical Spy Hunter problem though). For a better Spy Hunter, and a faithful arcade adaptation, go to shockwave.com and play theirs. As far as Moon Patrol, the music is hard to hear, and the UFO's are hard to shoot and and dodge, but it is a faithful arcade adaptation. Unless you REALLY liked these two games in the past (to discover this about yourself, ask yourself ""Can I hum the Moon Patrol theme?""), I wouldn't suggest the purchase. I feel I paid $15 too much for this $20 cartridge.."
negative,"What the hell !!!!!!!!: can't remember the last time I rolled my eyes so many times in a movie I knew within the first 10 minutes of the show that it was gonna {be bad]>See the acrobatic martial-artist French 17th-century swordsmen &#65533; words you had a right never to expect to see together! and the action is so badly edited and darkly lit that it's hard to tell what's happening many scenes dark and difficult to seeThis movie was one of the worst I have seen this year bad acting and the awful remake you must have watched Richard Lester's very enjoyable ""The Three Musketeers"" (1973) and ""The Four Musketeers"" (1974). Save your time and rent those two tonight."
negative,Skin Art: I thought this was a very poorly written movie; it could have and should have been a lot better. The acting was also poor.
negative,"Unfortunately, it's noisy: I really liked this model. It played our DVDs and DivX movies very well. It started up quickly, its settings were well-designed, and it seemed sturdy.So why did I return it? Because it was noisy. We could clearly hear it running during movies. My old Liteon (non-upscaling) player was much quieter, and the new Sony and LG players we tried were virtually silent.Too bad. I liked everything else about the Pioneer, but the noise was a showstopper."
positive,"The BEST Book I've ever written -- JOHN JB WILSON.: I hope you have as much fun reading this humorous collection of film cliche's as I had writing it and collecting the movie stills which illustrate it. I know I wrote it, but I still laugh out loud at my favorite entries every time I pick it up. WHY NOT PICK UP A COPY YOURSELF"
positive,indiana jones fans will enjoy this very much.: this is a really well made documentary about indiana jones fans by indiana jones fans.you can really tell that the director is a huge fan of the indiana jones series.i will be honest and say the first half of the dvd is a little bit better than the second and i wished about 10 minutes would have been edited off and about 10 minutes of the deleted scenes put back in but it is all there with the deleted scenes being available on the disc anyway.my hats off to the makers of this movie and i really enjoyed this dvd and recomend it to all indiana jones fans.
negative,The Scarlett Letter: Written in old English. It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said.
negative,"Rips the skin, but does shave close!: The love of my life has always used this brand of shaver and when this newer model came out we bought it for an upgrade. While it does shave close, for the first time ever my loves skin is ripped and cut up every single time. So you need to think hard before this upgrade. The model just before this new one worked very well."
negative,Supernatural fluff piece.: Flat Keanu Reeves vanity project that lacks a lot brain and allot of showmanship with a story that makes no sense and a leading man who can't act the role he's playing. Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are about the only actors in the film who give great performances and that's really because they are over qualified to be in a movie of this type. Weisz gives too much heart and soul to her role and Stormare gives a sadistic edge that is way too fierce to be in a movie like this. Both of them are head and shoulders over Keanu Reeves in the acting department and both of them literally blow him out of this film.See it for their performances only because it's the only good you are going to get out of this bad movie.
positive,"Our bible study is using: We are about half way through and a majority of members have expressed they like the book. We are using this in conjunction with the study guide. We choose a few key study guide questions to discuss each week.The content is great, the use of scripture to support is pretty good, and the message is clear and pertinent."
positive,"Highly Underrated: I LOVE THIS MOVIE! So what if it's not the game! I'm just unhappy they did a crappy soundtrack. I had to buy a bootleg cd to get Alan Silvestri's score. The movie had its parts just for kids, but I am 15 years old and I still want a pair of those cool boots! I wish there was a DVD, too. When I first saw this movie, I hoped there would be a sequel, and I still want Super Mario Breothers Part II. Those of you who hate this movie wiil probably grow up to be critics, like another reviewer said. Critics usually hate the best movies. They hated this, The Goonies, Jurassic Park, Blues Brothers, etc., and these are great movies.Take a look after the credits for a surprise from the Super Koopa Cousins!"
negative,"Nowhere near "" Stephen King at his best"": After Bag of Bones and Hearts in Atlantis, I was hoping for a truly well written book. I know he is still capable as the Green Mile and Wizard and Glass have proven. So what is this? Not his worst book. Remember Tommyknockers or Needful Things? But certainly nowhere near his best work. There is some great dialogue and neat concepts in this book, but not enough to save it. Wait for the paperback edition and save some money if you really must read it. I will not buy another King book right after it has been released. I am that disappointed."
positive,"A portrait of Gabriel's solo career: Peter Gabriel is for sure one of the most creative and talented modern musicians.He is makin music since almost 40 years.During that 40 years styles and fashion were changing very often and Peter followed them, but always changing into a new quality.""Shaking The tree"" is a portrait of Gabriel's solo career from 1976 hit single ""SOLSBURY HILL"" through punk rock severity and Synth Minimalism (""I DONT REMEMBER,""SHOCK THE MONKEY"",""GAMES WITHOUT FRONTIERS"") to modern etno-flavoured pop (Title track,""RED RAIN"",""BIKO"").In my opinion Some Tracks are missing here(Why did all Second album has been missed???) but no tracks are unecesarry.Peter's Music is touching (""MERCY STREET"",""HERE COMES THE FLOOD""), Sometimes great to dance (""BIG TIME,""SLEDGEHAMMER"") and mysterious (""ZAAR"", ""SAN JACINTO"").In all cases It's unussualy catchy and original.Just listen to it.if you never heard Peter Gabriel now is the time to hear his tracks"
positive,"Fly Boys Lafayette Escadrille,movie for Plane lovers!!: The ""experts"" always!! This movie is enjoyable,the air battle scenes are very well done,story well told,it is for planes lovers not for history or movie ""experts"",the dogfights are fantastic!!I RECOMMEND for any plane Lover!!For the History ""experts"",Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch-Gilbert du Motier, formerly the Marquis de La Fayette (or Lafayette) (September 6, 1757-May 20, 1834) was a former French aristocrat and military officer who participated in both the American and French revolutions.He permanently renounced the title ""Marquis"" before the French National Assembly in June, 1790.)Lafayette served in the American War of Independence both as a general and as a diplomat, serving entirely without pay in both roles.Movies are for Entertainment!!I highly recommend this movie."
negative,"Not Needed -- Free Alterative: This was bought for me as a gift, but it is completely unneccesary. It's simply a case of a company using widely available technology to make some money off of peoples' ignorance... If I hear a song that I wonder ""...hmm, what was that?"" I simply log on to the StarCD website and choose the radio station I was listening to and the time. It uses the same data that this device does. The only thing this device does is record times. If you think its worth spending the money for a keychain timestamp-thingermajig, go ahead. Ill just jot it on my hand with a pen. (I have no commercial or otherwise affiliation with StarCD, I'm just an impressed user.)"
negative,"Decieving looks.: I bought this item because it looked way better than all-plastic sprinklers. However, regardless of the looks it still plastic where it counts the most, the gear is made of plastic. It didn't last even a season. So stay away from this item for this money you can shop around and find a better one."
negative,"Where's the letterbox?: Like other reviewers, I'm baffled as to why this is not in letterbox. I can live without super-duper extras, but I have no reason to upgrade from my VHS until a widescreen version is published. The rating is reflective of my dislike of the fullscreen formatting. The movie itself is one of the great romantic comedies-a love letter to love itself, and NYC."
positive,"HCI w/pepsin: This product arrived quickly in perfect packaging. I believe it is a great product for digestive support. I certainly recommend it to anyone who cares about his/her haelth, and I recommend this company!"
negative,"Don't Buy: This ""locking"" gas cap has been a BIG disappointment. It does not lock or unlock easily, and it is a pain getting it to do either. I wish I had not bought it.I ended up throwing it in the garbage. DON'T BUY!"
negative,NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!!: THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD JUST GOT A CHINK IN THEIR ARMOUR. THEY SHOULD HAVE STOPPED WHILE THEY WERE ON TOP.MISSING CLASSIC PUNCH. PSYHO CIRCUS GIVES A HIT BUT NOTHING ELSE CAN KEEP UP THE PACE.
negative,"worked for 2 weeks: Needed a sharpener for our church. Product was priced right and received adequate reviews. Sharpened about 1000 pencils in 3 weeks and it burned up. Threw it away and will buy one that costs twice as much. Hopefully, extra $$$$ spent will be worth it."
positive,"Surprisingly compelling: This book was recommended by Amazon.com and I threw it in my shopping cart for fun. I found it surprisingly compelling. I do not remember ever reading Hardy before. His writing is wonderful and not at all old-fashioned, in fact, it is a modern book in sensibility. If you like books that care about characters and place, read it!"
negative,"Well.... then there's this.: If you're the type that thinks swing dance belongs on the same radio station that plays the top ten Billboard, and/or If you like jazz but don't know who Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and Count Basie are, get this!If it's so good, why are so many people selling it used???No offense to the band, but there are many, many better albums (and bands) out there that are *so* much better. Granted, some of these songs are catchy, this would be my last pick for this type of music. Closer? Big Bad voodoo daddy and Setzer. Even more? Indigo Swing and Rhythm rockets. Ray Gelato. Lavay Smith. Steve Lucky & Rhumba Bums. Want to really get closer to jazz and / or swing? check those out first. Closer? Look into the real evolution of swing dance. But please don't look here and start on the wrong foot."
negative,"Cutesy Poo from La La Land: Maybe a lot of people enjoy being addressed as though they're just a little bit dumber than this 1st time Mother, but I did not. The author writes as though becoming a mother is akin to being left alone in the nuclear bomb assembly room without an employee handbook. As a first-timer I needed more specific information and less hand-holding from a fellow neophite. Keep looking if you want a book that will yield something useful when he's crying frantically at 3:00AM."
negative,"TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED: I have greatly enjoyed Anne of Green gables and Anne of Avonlea that I personally bought new VHS tapes for my friends to watch. I was overjoyed to see that a sequel had been made to Anne of Avonlea. I was however, terribly disappointed at how P.E.I. was no longer the main setting in the third movie. How could they have thoughtr of digressing from Montgomery's story? I think it was such an injustice!!!"
negative,Don't buy used.: I purchased this product used and was deeply disappointed with its performance: or utter lack thereof.Don't be cheap: spring for the new stuff or you'll regret buying this item.
negative,"q tip at his worst: this is the epitome of falling off - the lyrics are wack (pretty girl, real good girl ... my itty bitty world) - the beat is silly - i dont know what happend to tip - he's been my hero since way back, but the old tip woiuld have agreed - this song is just plain sad"
negative,Poorly written book and lazy plot line: I wouldn't recommend this book to my family and friends. It's a poorly written book with incoherent plot lines and inadequate character building. Don't waste your time and money. This maybe one movie adaptation that is better than the book. Go watch the movie instead.
positive,"A beautiful story , you cant help but love it..............: I loved this book! Although I was only 8 years old when I read, and are ten now, I believe that I fully do understand what the book is about. I have always been fascxinated by this book and when I read this it just blew me away. When I read this I actually feel like Im in the attic with Jo, in the dressing room with Meg, sitting at the piano with beth, or trading lemons with Amy. I think this is my all time favorite book and that it will continue to be a beautiful example to all of us. ( But I still was upset and mad when Laurie married Amy instead of Jo!!!!!!!!!!!)"
positive,"Master Key To Riches/ Napoleon Hill: Received a personal recommendation from a man who, beginning back in 1972, applied all the pricipals Hill has laid out in this book, particularly the chapter on ""Self Dicipline""... which in less than three (3) years time ( that's 36 months...less time then some car financing contracts!!) brought this man from being an alchoholic transient fruit picker...to where he is today...a totally financially free man with personal asset value of over $22 million dollars & an increasing personal annual income of over $4 million. This man, still today, carries & reads this book with him in his briefcase...wherever he travels."
negative,"good for the money: I, too, purchased this CD player for my 8 year old daughter. I am really impressed with the sound quality for the price. If you plan to leave this player stationary (on a desk, etc.), I think you will be more then pleased. Also, it's an excellent gift for a young child, who doesn't need a top-of-the-line player. The price is VERY reasonable, and the unit is straightforward and easy to use."
positive,"Only the British .................: can turn a somber occasion into a laugh riot! Absolutely one of the funniest comedies I've seen in years. The Brits really know how to make fun of themselves and make people laugh all over the World. I laughed so uncontrollably loud, my neighbors thought I was going crazy in this Frank Oz directed movie. The ongoing ""Valium"" gag was the real clincher in this movie; affecting Alan Tudyk's (Firefly, 3:10 To Yuma, Knocked Up) ""Simon"" to Peter Vaughn's ""Uncle Alfie."" Peter Dinklage (In Bruges, 30 Rock, Nip/Tuck) adds fire to the Valium-induced high-jinks. Andy Nyman as Howard was uproariously funny. Bang-Bang laughs from the improbable happenings at a funeral service. Matthew MacFayden as ""Daniel,"" the long-suffering son, trying to keep order and decorum at his Dad's funeral, was the sinking sand amongst the solid rocks in attendance. Too funny."
negative,"Unhappy: I never got this drive to go faster than 2x. I finally returned it, after spending a day getting no help from Sony tech support. They had no clue what the problem was, and their final answer was to tell me to go back to the store and buy some Sony DVD-Rs. I returned the drive and got a HP dvd840e instead. It works great with the same computer and DVD-Rs. Plus it has Lightscribe which is a nice bonus.Avoid this drive..."
negative,"Really boring...: I agree that if you're a British history major you'll really enjoy this book, but if you're not I wouldn't suggest even trying it. I read this book last year, when I was in seventh grade, and it took me months to read despite the fact that it's only a little over 100 pages long! I mean, the entire thing takes place in a hospital bed! If you're interested in learning about British history, or if you have insomnia and need something soporific, dig in."
negative,"The worst novel ever written.: There is nothing intellectually challenging about this book. Instead, it is a cruel insult to the intelligence of any thinking person who tries to read it. Even the people who don't ""get it,"" and feel compelled to give this miserable piece of trash 5-star ratings let some of its true character seep through.In the 5-star reviews alone, we see: ""my head aches after reading it,"" ""one will never be able to understand,"" ""a vast, complex book about nothing,"" ""when I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptyness,"" ""meaning that vanishes in the distance of one's ability to comprehend it,"" ""Ulysses is not Ulysses,"" ""sometimes the narrative line just seems to dissapear.""Anyone with respect for themselves should skip this ""book about nothing"" and find a book about _something_ instead."
positive,"Update....following many more listens !!: I'm back. I wrote a review yesterday, having just received the CD and having listened to it approximately 6 times. Since then I've listened to it many, many more times, adding head phones to allow me to hear that magical voice more clearly. The more I listen, the more I love it. Regardless of the flaws I may perceive with the production aspects of the CD, Clay's voice is absolutely stunning--and that's what the attraction has always been in the first place: that voice ! Clay Aiken is one of a kind."
positive,"Outstanding: Even for someone who wasn't a huge fan of the show, this movie is a must see. Clever story, great flick!"
positive,Fun set: This is a fun little set. There are not alot of pieces in case this is your first Pop-Onz purchase. But they fit inside the green 'mountain' like a carry case that is easy to take along on road trips or to the baby sitters.
negative,"Informative, but...: Expected it to focus on pre-1492. Much of the book can't help but include post 1492 with inferences to what it was like before. Considered it a daunting task to write such a book, and still can see it as not really achieved to the level it suggests it might."
negative,"Amusing, worth seeing for free: We were able to see this DVD for free, which is an appropriate price for a silly movie based on the adventures of two stoners. Their goal is to watch THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and start their own business based on an infomercial. They enter rehab to see the TV, get caught up in some other crime, basically wander around. There are one or two very funny scenes, one that I found extremely disturbing and offensive, and a happy, if implausible, ending.If you already have pay channels and it's on, or if someone else offers to lend it to you, it's not a total waste of time, but don't spend money to see it."
negative,"Dry and Humorless: I totally disagree with the reviewer from Hongkong who must have been writing about some other book when she portrayed Infatuation as funny and sexy, with witty dialogues and hot passion. As it happens, most of the book is devoted to a character analysis of Judith. In a nut shell, Judith knows that she is an ugly duckling with incredible brain power. We don't see any real attraction developing between Luke and Judith until the last quarter of the book. And then when it does, the author's analysis of Judith is vindicated for she is accepted by Luke because of her brainy self rather than her looks. The most tragicomedical line of the book must be when Luke agrees with Judith that she is not beautiful. Disappointingly for me, just when I'm getting interested in the story in the last quarter of the book, the plot reaches its climax and comes to an end. The story is dry and tends to drag on. I must say that the writing is good as can be expected from Charlotte Lamb. I gave it two stars."
positive,"Consistently Excellent!!!: It's nice to finally have many of these remixes in one place, including many I had not heard before. Despite these songs being from many different genres and times, they flow together like liquid butter! The new Thievery song ""Originality"" is a slamming reggae jam that will liven up your party in the coming months. Imagine today's young people getting down to The Doors, courtesy of Thievery's ""Strange Days"" remix. Elsewhere, there are plenty of songs to spin, no matter your mood. This is not just some knockoff package till Thievery can deliver another studio album - this is a full fledged musical work!On another note, it's nice to know that Thievery is embracing the beauty of album packaging, with another first rate package here to go along with ""The Cosmic Game"" and ""Richest Man in Babylon."" Even though CD sales are going the way of the passenger pigeon, it's nice to browse through such an elaborate package, which can then enhance the entire listening experience."
positive,"Spectacular, surprising, funny, thoughtful: If you've never seen anything by Attenborough, you really have something wonderful to look forward to. Like with all his shows, you'll see things you've never seen before, things you've seen but have not understood before, and things you would never imagine existed in nature. Everyone alive should see these shows. And then go outside."
positive,Amazing product: While I can't attest to it's fat burning capabilities it definitely helps with muscle fatigue and soreness. If I have any complaints is that I'm taking 9 pills a day and it burns through the bottle in no time.
negative,"TOO SMALL: I was so disappointed, much too small, not as described. I did not believe this was to be a large."
negative,"Terrible edition: I'm just starting to read it but I'm sure the novel will fulfill my ""great expectations"". But I have to complain about the physical book. The pages came incredibly badly cut and the cover was thorn and damaged, as if it had been used for over a decade!Besides, the introductory study gives a lot of details and hints about how the story is going to end and I hate that!"
negative,"Unreadable: It's a mystery to me how this book can be sold as a ""Large-print"" Bible, because the font size is 8. I couldn't read it. If you're looking for a large-print Bible, don't buy this one."
negative,I would not consider this an interactive tutor: Just ask questions and give answers. If you don't already know the subject matter asking questions does not tutor you.
negative,"Not pleased at all!: The singing is not really exciting. The arrangements are poor and played on electronics. Overall, a disappointment.The seller was excellent, good price and speedy delivery.Fausto, NJ"
positive,"Big Box of Happiness: All three board books are great. My newborn loves the rhyming sounds and the rhythmic meter of the text. Pajama Time is the best of the three, but Barnyard Dance isn't far behind. Dinosaurs isn't as good as the other two, but it's still worthy of the collection. Sandra Boynton in general is fantastic for small board books (The Belly Button Book and But Not the Hippopotamus being my two all-time faves) and you can't really go wrong with this collection (unless you let your kid eat it)."
positive,"great for sailboat racers: This vedio offers a good over all workout for anyone who sails. The upper body workout strengthens the major muscle groups which are used for trimming main and jib sheets, or lifting a spinnaker pole. The one disadvantage is that it is 70 min. long."
negative,"Really Not Worth It: There is undoubtedly useful information in The Hidden Ivies. Most of it, however, is contained on the front cover. Other than naming the thirty colleges, ""Of excellence,"" the book does little to differentiate between the schools. In fact, the descriptions of six schools that I am considering (all contained in Greene's book) sound practically identical! Overall, this guide is useful for listing thirty colleges named on its cover. If you're looking for more information than that, look somewhere else."
positive,"Great CD for calming the mind: This is a really nice CD, with shakuhachi-style music. A couple of things that may not be apparent from the description:-- The CD is from Verve, as the artist comes from the jazz tradition. This didn't come up for me explicitly in the music itself, but I thought it was an interesting way to make sense of the performance on the album.-- Most of the CD is improvisational. This wasn't an 'issue,' but it does emphasize that the music on the album is primarily non-melodic and spontaneous.Overall, a nice album if you want to foster a calm mind."
negative,"Doesn't hold air: I bought this air mattress to use while my new bed was being shipped from back east, the bed lost air every night and I woke up almost on the floor. I tried to send it back but it was impossible to get back into the box."
positive,"great machine: This was my 2nd Keurig- the 1st being a smaller machine for our camper. After reading reviews about not brewing, I decided to give it a go & if it malfunctioned, work thru a return.I did have problems with it not brewing and was cycling (opening & closing to register the k-cup) and ultimately called for support. They walked me thru clearing anything that might be blocking it. Worked fine for a while.Then quite by accident I found that if I did NOT turn the machine off after every use, I didn't seem to have this problem. Needless to say, I leave the machine on now all the time (except when we leave for vacations) and I have had no problems with it at all! When it is always in ready mode, I don't have any problems with brewing!LOVE this brewer! I'd love more latte options, but that doesn't count against the brewer."
negative,"Don't Last: Like others have stated, these break easily. Snap at the seam after a bit on a standard beer bottle. If they make it through a couple parties, the next time you use them they're brittle and fall apart before you get them on the bottle.We did have a lot of fun with these the first day. We'd purchased a couple of different sets and had them in a basket for people to pick out which drunken-alter-ego they were. Went over well. Just broke before the night was over.Could be a lot of fun if the material was different."
positive,"The Named: I thought that this book was great. I am not a big reader. But we had to pick a book for class, so I picked this one! I didn't think that it would be that exciting, but after I read it I new I was wrong. Their are just so many good parts, but my favorite parts are romanse. This book is so good that I am on my way to reading the sequel. I loved this book and if you like advanture, romance, and humor I know that you will love this book."
negative,Do not buy!!!: This product is money going to the trash. I used it once and it doesn't do ANYTHING. It can hardly grasp the hair and can't really streighten anything. Simply doesn't fit.
positive,"R&J-Summary By EricaH: Romeo & Juliet is a romance novel. It's a story that will make your heart sink. This magnificent couple had such a strong love for each other. It was so strong that they died together. In the beginning it was crazy how they are enemies and they want to be together but it's hard to because what they are doing is wrong to their families. At the ending they died together with their love stronger than ever, it's a heartbreaking story, wishing that they would live happily ever after.I really enjoyed this story, although I do wish that they could have lived to be together and in love."
negative,"I feel duped: I found this book while I was looking for a book of the same title about the stock market crash of 1929. Based on the glowing reviews posted and the summary of the plot, I decided to go ahead an buy it. I took it on a long airplane flight, greatly looking forward to this ""book you couldn't put down"". I can only say I'm glad I brought a backup book! Now I notice that almost all the previous reviews are from Ohio and likely friends and family of the author. If my brother or good friend had written this, I'd be polite and say nice things too. But it's definitely not ready for prime time. Amateurish writing, not a strong story, questionble accuracy of history, etc."
positive,"I like: God versus Satan, Good versus Evil. With a really really good cast, good special effects and an interesting story line"
positive,"Wonderful tribute to a great author: As a science fiction writer myself I can appreciate the creativity of this movie. Not only did it look good, the characters, including the robot, were real. Sonny had my vote from the beginning. It made your care more about the self aware robot than humans at times.Fantastic imagery, directing and special effects.Bravo!!Kimberly Raiser"
negative,"Don't waste your money: These wrist weights began leaking the sandy material on my first use. I bought Bell wrist weights from Amazon a couple of years ago and those have held up wonderfully. Sadly, Amazon doesn't carry them anymore. These Valeo wrist weights are very poor quality. For them to leak the weight material on first use they obviously were not made well. Amazon, you should remove these from your site."
negative,"Preaching to the Converted: C.S. Lewis is without doubt the finest Christian apologetic who ever lived. While reading ""Mere Christianity,"" I could not help being impressed with his persuasive writing style and heart-felt conviction. Upon closer inspection, however, subtle ambiguities come to light. Though they are too numerous to mention here, suffice it to say that Lewis relies on emotion rather than logic and empiricism to reach his ""logical"" conclusions. On the positive side is his irreproachabe sincerity: C.S. Lewis is one of the few men who give Christians a GOOD name. Regardless of his faith, he was a lion of a man and scholar, and his kind is sorely missed. Too bad he, like so many others, preferred comfort to the Truth."
negative,"Thanks For Nothing!: I bought this book with high hopes, but came away EXTREMELY disapointed.After reading the entire book,taking all the practice exams,studying and re-reading the book for over a month,getting between 750-800 on the cd-rom exams, I took the real exam today and failed..badly. This book's long-winded text and too simple practice exams gave me just enough confidence to get led to slaughter. I was completely unprepared for the A+ exam.The Questions in the real A+ exam barely even resembled anything I studied in this book.The cd -rom stinks too, It locks up most of the time,and is filled with typo's, and even gives a couple of wrong answers! Can someone in the real world help me pass this test?"
negative,"Why??: I don't get this toy, it seems to suck it. I also don't understand the whole fart or burping that everyone else has experienced. I've never heard it do that. My parents got this for my 3 year old. A little young if you ask me. I personally don't get it. What's the point? I mean I can listen to the radio to hear music. I just don't get it and the eyes moving do take away from the actual playing of music, they are loud. I think this toy is just a waste of money, but my parents can afford it so I'll keep it until I get annoyed and throw it out."
negative,"Strong magnets but really thin- wont hold thicker paper. Mounting screw included broke while screwing it in to wood cabinet: I just received this 5 minutes ago.I went right away to get my husbands screwdriver. I screwed one screw into our wood armoire and was working on the second when the tip of the screw just fell off- and taking the old screw out of my armoire was very difficult. I didn't want to ruin my wood armoire, or ruin e hole for the next screw that I went to get ( one of our own). Can't they at least put decent screws in with this???!! I've never had a screw break like that on me ( I'm not a big person, so there wasn't a lot of weight behind my effort)."
positive,"350z Exhaust: Exhaust is nice, just have some rattling I need to fix underneath the car. The extra power was noticeable and the sound was just a little louder than stock."
negative,"Very Basic: This book reads more like a college term paper than a book. Perhaps it was based on the listing that it was also published in the Journal of Housing for the Elderly. The tables are very poorly formatted (sideways, what is that about?) and mostly not very informative. I am researching to open a Residential Care Service and I would say of the 106 short pages in this book I found maybe 10 of them useful or interesting. Also note that the book was written in 1991 so all of the demographic and pricing information is 18 years out of date."
positive,"It helps: I wore some shoes that had been comfortable for a year, but I guess more poor feet are changing. They couldn't cope with the stress of standing in those shoes for hours. A slight bunion got much worse after that day so I bought this splint to fix it.It did help. Wore it overnight and my foot was realigned in the morning. I hate having foot troubles but until I can afford better care, splints and other OTC remedies help. I write these reviews because I know how frustrating it is to try to solve foot problems. Even many podiatrists don't have adequate treatments."
positive,"Love My MP3: I love this tiny MP3 player. Very easy to use. If you do have any problems, their customer support is great. I had to download a driver to get it going and I also called about another problem. They talked me right through everything and it all works well. I bought it primarly for the purpose of using a speaker system with it so I can listen to music in my office instead of depending on the radio. The earphoes included were not the best, so I did purchase another pair for improved comfort. I have loaded a video and some photos on it as well as music. To add videos and pictures it is necessary to dowload free software from the Sansa site. I feel this is a great product and it was better than I expected with a very reasoable price."
negative,"The Hobbit: Animated (dvd): I was looking forward to watching this animated version, as i havent read the book. I was expecting it to be like the original Lord Of The Rings animated classic... but was dissapointed by a few things. Firstly the animation is aimed at younger children of about 2-5 years old. The songs are really really annoying & too american style, as well as american accents which, i feel spoil it. The atmosphere is great & the backdrops wonderfull. As well as some really beautifull effects....The main thing i hate is that Golem looks more like a frog than how he is supposed to look.It great to see The Hobbit on dvd, but i prefer to watch it with the sound OFF.Why didnt they just make this & ""the return of the king"" amimation, the same as the original? or mabe just tweak it slightly here & there?visualy impressive, but a sonic failure."
positive,Not too big and not too small: Great item and easy to clean. Well made and looks good. What more can I say?
negative,"Earlobes and sweat? Say it isn't so Dean. Say it isn't so.: While the by-line is admirably short, the text actually comes off quite linguistically, given all the maladroit proclivities that might have prevented a lesser author from treading so smoothly on wings of bread and slurry. William, whose middle name - as we are to believe - is Dean, ends his saga with the name Howells. Some may enjoy this chicanery, but I, for one, was enormously displeased. For instance, why all that talk about trade agreements in the preface yet no listing for either ""trade"" or ""agreement"" in the index? And, I must ask, why was there no index at all? One is left to wonder what other key concepts and biographical references were left un-indexed. Is there any value in such a text? The answer, quite simply, is also not available in the index. Why? I became very angry by the end. All indexed. Why? The answer, quite simply, is given five sentences before this one. (The reader is advised to refer to it. (ed.))"
negative,"Lysenko in music: Welcome to the nonsensical ramblings of the Trofim Lysenko of US musicology, Joseph Kerman. The bilious opinions of Kerman, a conformist snob whose lack of depth, judgment or taste is meant to be obscured by relentless aggression and malevolence, are best ignored, or even used as a reverse guide. The opera lover does not need to care about what this intellectual dwarf has to say. But I pity those for whom Kerman's opinion has ever mattered professionally."
negative,"how true - use this book: I bought this book, excited about the prospect of a great book that would be interesting and different. It is a book that says what it is, but as a teacher, I could make all the signs that are in it and have access to most of the documents that could be legally binding. I was disappointed but should have known better...."
positive,"The all time #1 AOR album!!: From the keyboard intro to Pleasure Palace all the way to the end of Jealous Heart, this album never fails to deliver. There are no filler tracks, every song is a 110% example of what a classic rock song should sound like. Where are they now.........."
negative,"Moonstike: I received Moonsturck and The Seven Year Itch for Chritsmas ordered from Amazon. I love this movie and was excited to see it on blueray. When I played it you get as far as the 20th Century announcement and then a message comes up that if you have any problems viewing the bluray go to .... then the screen stays black. Going to the suggested website was not helpful. My niece sent it back to Amazon who was quick to send a replacement. Sadly, the replacement is doing the same thing. I have no problems watching other blurays nor The Seven Year Itch (ordered from Amazon at the same time and looks and sounds great). I don't know if both blurays came from the same manufacturer. She will be contacting Amazon about it, since they won't speak with me because I didn't order it. If you take a chance on this product open it carefully because you may have to return it."
negative,"Can't get through it: Looking forward to the movie version because I think Meryl Streep is such a great actress, I decided to buy this book and read it before the movie is released. I rarely read books after I have seen the movie. Even though it is not a genre that I usually select, I was looking forward to it. I have been disappointed. I can't get into at all. . . no, I haven't finished it.I don't like the style. It is indulgent and somewhat crude at times. It isn't that I don't like the blog style; it is that the stream of consciousness style takes things so off subject most of the time that it is difficult to remember just what the point is.I wish I would have read a few reviews before I bought it. Live and learn. I doubt I will finish this book."
positive,"Human values triumph over evil: A violent gangster is murdered and arrives in Hell. A perfect double for an honest judge, whom the devil wishes to corrupt, he is recruted to take over the judges body and thus make the judge sin. The gangsters convoluted sense of decensy and fair play thwart the devil."
positive,anne of green gables the continuing story: IT is the best movie that I saw. I chould watch it over and over again. They should make another movie very soon.
negative,"warm at best: If want your coffee to stay hot this will not do it, mildly warm at best. With fire considerations I guess there isn't one that will truly keep you coffee hot, just have your expectations in line when ordering."
negative,"Offensive: I'm a white female who is married to a black man. I'm outraged that she does not agree with interracial marriages. She talks about living in AmeriKKA, but it is her as well who promotes racist views. How are we to live as a nation if people can't be friends/lovers just because of their colour. Obviously we haven't progressed as a nation if we can't accomplish that."
negative,"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing!!!!!: I'm thinking of cancelling my subscription. Ever since Time Warner Publishing acquired Essence, it seems to be cantering to dark-skinned white women and NOT Black women."
negative,eBook problems: The kindle version of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is full of typos and errors. If you want to get the best out of this excellent novel then rather buy the traditional paperback version. The poor quality of this edition can only damage Penguin's reputation.
negative,"Poor Quality: There are a huge number of typos that are very distracting and frustrating. As stated by other reviewers, multiple words in a row are smushed together and there are random symbols floating around the pages. I recommend going to a used books store or something similar to get the book, because this version is not worth the money."
positive,"Happy Happy Happy: I purchased these tasty morcellas from La Tienda a year ago for my husband's birthday as a surprise. With shipping costs added I thought it was expensive for just a couple of links but it was so worth it. I ordered the two kinds offered (with onions and with rice). You can't go wrong with fried morcellas served with hot sauce, crackers and a cold beer. My husband is already hinting at getting another order."
negative,Not my kind of book: This is the first novel by Belva Plain I have read and I can say without hesitation it will be my last. I found the entire premise to be nothing short of silly (how many mothers would give up their children based on their supposed involvement in an accidental fire?) The plot was laughable and the main character pathetic. Sorry I wasted my time on this one.
positive,"One of the best movies ever!: I loved this movie. It is an instant classic with up to date special effects. I also noticed book elements from ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" by Alexandre Dumas in it. Overall, a classic, buy yours today."
positive,"Love Westerns: This movie was great, I love Tom Selleck in everything, but especially westerns... the quality of this movie was very good."
negative,junk: I tried giving this movie a chance... watched it all the way thru... even though I was going to shut it off multiple times... this is probably the worst movie I've watched ever...
negative,meh: There was very bad effects & evil characters that look like they stepped out of the 10 dollar costume halloween shop. If you are in to paying 1.99 for really cheesy stuff this is for you. The bad guy does have a good demonic voice & some interestingly complex and incredibly vulgar sayings.
negative,Do not buy!: I bought this product in Nov.2011. It stopped working in Oct.2012. A poorly made product. A waste of money.This product should be discontinued.
positive,"I Persuade You to Read this Book!: The novel Persuasion by Jane Austen is very good. Although slow at places, it definatly redeems itself throughout the novel. The protagonist, Anne, is in love with a man, but is persuaded out of love because of his social status. The book is a classic romatice novel, but is not cheesy to say the least. I encourage everyone who enjoys a good novel to read this book, but especially females. This book is centered around the social status and appearance of the people in the early 1800's. The way Anne doesn't care, makes her differant than the rest of the characters, but also helps the reader consider thinking for themselves instead of being persuaded by other people's thoughts. By the end of the novel, the reader has the decision whether persuasion is good or bad. I really enjoyed the novel. The reader just needs to be able to make it through the first couple of chapters, then the book is really enjoyable."
negative,Do not buy it just to see Linda Blair: Poor action movie and Linda is more like an extra than a main player. She has maybe 15 minutes of on-screen presence and she is never close to nude.Only buy if you get into GRADE B 80's movies.
negative,"Dumb, Bad, Really Bad: This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I usually enjoy Nicholas Cage movies but this is so far beneath him I can't imagine why he would even do it."
positive,"Move over Faulkner: The Last Juror is a wonderful story about the decade between the late '60's and late '70's, tangentially covering social and political issues from Vietnam, Civil Rights, and the youth movement. The characters are real people you will care about. The story is well paced and grabbing. If anyone has been harboring doubts about the status of Grisham in the Pantheon of great American writers this novel will easily dispel them. This is a rich Southern Novel that will stand beside all others."
positive,"Liftmaster 83LM Billion Garage Door Remote Transmitter: It was nice to be able to find an item that is for an older garage door. It works just fine, there have been no issues."
negative,"This item is a total scam: This ""book"" is only a pamphlet that is available online for FREE! I recently bought this for the length of the book (claims 264 pages) but it is not. I have recently had to deal with a close family friend suddenly dealing with schizophrenia and it has had a traumatic effect on his family and his friends. This is a serious illness that not only affects the person diagnosed but everyone surrounding them. The last thing anyone would want at this time is a book that claims to be something it is not!!"
positive,Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: I received this air bed over two months ago and we love it. I bought it for my granddaughter to sleep on and it's the easiest thing to set up and take down to put away. I put a mattress pad on under the sheets and she says she would rather sleep on the air bed than her regular bed because it that comfortable. No leaks so far. I'm very happy with this purchase.
negative,"LOUSY EDITED VERSION!!!!!: This has always been one of my favorite Streisand films, but they have made an unbelievably criminal mistake in releasing the edited version. I originally saw this--as a youngster--on late-night (pre-cable) TV, with the ""F word"" intact, and it was absolutely brilliant! This version is crap! PLEASE RELEASE THE ORIGINAL R-RATED FILM!!!!!!"
negative,"Too bad....: Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad."
positive,"An exciting adventure: As one of the 100 greatest books written, at least this book doesn't leave you wondering why. It's a classic in it's sense of adventure, sci fi, and originality. Relatively short, this book keeps your interest throughout and it's main character of Captain Nemo is a true joy. In summary, a very entertaining book."
positive,"Still Waiting for the DVD: I watched this movie many years ago, back in the '80's and it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. Charleton Heston, Keith Carradine and Billy Dee Williams were awesome! Now, when will this movie be put on DVD format? This movie is a classic, in the line of Rich Man, Poor Man, The Winds of War, The Ten Commandments, Thornbirds, North and South and so many more. Please get this movie on DVD, with all the extra's, like interviewing some of the actors who are still alive, who can reflect on their particular role in the movie. Let's have it!!!!"
positive,"It's alive.....: In the words of Dr. Frankenstein, ""it's alive""!!!! I feel as if my bike just literally came alive. It's a 2011 Hayabusa with 638 miles. It was rediculous before but felt slightly held back like it wasn't breathing correctly and had a slight backfire. After exchanging the air filter, adding Castrol Power 4 RS racing 10w40 full synthetic and a K&N; oil filter, the bike came alive. It's fine now! I can feel it in the trottle.Shipping was really fast!!"
negative,"PIECE O' JUNK: If I could give this idiotic contraption 0 stars I would. There is no good way to attach it so it never adequately shields the baby. What's more, it topples over onto baby if you so much as breath on it, making it not only useless but dangerous."
positive,"Frightening movie with superb acting by Sir Hopkins: My recollection of the film -- I've only ordered it today (August 31, 1999) -- from my youth (when I was eight years old) is that of a genuinely frightening film which has a great deal of credibility to it. The dummy is seemingly real at all times, especially when it is killing some hapless victim. Hopkins acting is phenomenal. But one things disturbs me. I understand from other people's comments that there is significant editing on the tape available here. Should this be true, I am afraid I will be disappointed. I was hoping to see the movie in the way in which it was intended to run, i.e. the way it originally aired in 1978. The vulgar language of the dummy is integral to the film, I feel. Anyway, I look forward to receiving it."
positive,"Difference of opinion: The Reader from Boston is, of course, entitled to her opinion, with which I heartily disagree, but she should be aware that Ms. Hendrickson is probably the premier expert today on the Regency. Her reference book is a veritable bible for authors of Regency romance. For Ms. Boston's information, btw, a woman could, indeed, be a baronness in her own right, although it was rare. They could hold other titles as well, on occasion. At least one of the Duchesses of Marlborough held that title in her own right. I, personally find Ms. Hendrickson's books a delight, and her research is impeccable."
positive,my review: this book was awsome! the ideas and points brought up in this novel by bradbury reflects our own society today
positive,"Mighty compact Vacum: Great product for the price. This has great suction and ease of use. The only thing I don't care for is if you vacum for a long time, the machine tends to get too warm. Other than that I love it."
negative,Teletubbies bedtime stories and nursery rhymes: I am not sure why they say this is not published yet because I purchased this for my 2 yr.old son for Christmas 2000. I do not recommend this video at all. It only makes my son wilder at bedtime. There is no routine for bedtime and it is always daylight during the video and the other teletubbies just laugh. I laughed at myself for buying it.
negative,Worst movie ever: A good example of what is wrong with Hollywood today. I have never looked at my watch more times during a movie in my life. Brendan Fraser is one of the worst actors ever.
positive,"Pure Death Metal!: Personally, I found the spoken intros funny. Anyway, this band doesn't redefine the genre in any way but it does produce some ass-kicking balls out death metal. The vocals are evil, the riffs are brutal, and the drummer is incredible on some of his fill-ins and things. Also the cover of ""War Machine"" by Kiss at the end rocks."
positive,"Aids creativeity, like real good man. Wow!: I have this and the Kyser partial capo. The Shubb takes up less space and the guitar stays in tune.The Kyser tends to pull the strings out of tune. Hard to break this capo so it should last at least 234.6 years or until you die. What ever comes first.Using this capo on the on the bottom strings, 2nd fret, gives a pseudo DADGAD tuning."
negative,"A waste of plastic and metal....: This is without a doubt the most brainless movie ever made. Created for the ""Frat Boy"" demographic, Coyote Ugly is packed with scantilly clad hoochies dancing around on bar tops and acting very badly. The hoochies are impressive but that is the only halfway worthwhile aspect of this dreadful film. The plot is a stupid retread of the ""small town girl goes to the big city"" story ,the producers did'nt even try very hard to make a decent film around all the ""T"" & ""A"".Why would anyone want watch Coyote Ugly at a theatre or buy it on DVD when movies like this can be seen on late night cable seven days a week? At least the ""acting"" is better on those cable shows."
negative,"Old plots with very little action.: Not for my taste. ""Stargate: Continuum"" has a very old plot that has been reused over and over again in both ""Stargate SG-1"" as well as in sci-fi stories in general. The first half is lacking in action, and you don't see much of O'Neill in this one. He shows up in the first few minutes of the film and the last few, but that's it. And the story is lacking in structure. The second half of the movie wasn't that bad, but still not worth wasting your money on.Not recommended!"
negative,"Special Features Suck !!!!: I gave this movie a 5 out of 5 cause the movie itself is awesome. Absolutely just amazing...BUTI had to give the special features a 1 out of 5 casue they suck.Thats just the only way to describ them. There NOTHING of intrest really. Just some intreviews with people about the movie, some other crap about underwater life and stuff. ABSOLUTELY NO SPECIAL FEATURES about spongebob, NO SPECIAL FEATURES for Kids. They would HATE these lame excuses for special features..... nothing interesting or fun at all.Boo to everyone who had imput on this DVD for the spcial features, they really droped the bomb on it !!!!"
positive,"A Fantastic Read: I love to read, and I especially love to see a movie for the first time and find out that it was inspired by a novel. The Clan of the Cave Bear movie was good, but the book is amazing. Jean M. Auel tells an engaging story. Ayla's life from the loss of her parents, to being found by the Clan at age 5, to dealing with their differences is all very well told. I love the fact that she becomes what most women in the tribe would not even consider becomming. I read this very huge book in 2 days, I don't even remember if I stopped to eat or sleep. I try to reread it at least once a year. If you like books that grab your attention and then refuse to let go-This is the book for you."
positive,"Crucial Confrontations: A must read for supervisors and managers. With outstanding proven approaches to knowing what you want from a conversaton, what the other wants, and watching out for the relationship. Found it useful at work as a reference book, plus a great read for personal relationship communications as well. Would suggest reading Crucial Conversations first to really get the full view."
negative,"WANT REFUND!: The movies do not play in my xbox 360 console, which is my only source of a DVD player. i would appreciate a full refund considering i had to wait over 3 weeks just to get the DVDs that don't work."
positive,"Good Romance: Jessie picks up a hitchhiker with a baby on the highway, and when she stops at a diner, the woman she picked up goes to the ladies' room and doesn't come back, leaving the baby. Jessie drives to another diner, looking for the police station, but she found the sheriff, Dan, at the diner. The storm gets worse, and they spend the night in his small house next to the diner. Passion flares, but Jessie leaves the baby with Dan to go on and become a country singer.Tired of the touring, she decides 4 years later to come back and see what happened to the baby. Dan's brother had adopted her, but when he and his wife died, Dan took the child. He's not sure if he could trust Jessie to know this, since he was never fully convinced of her hitchhiker story, and was afraid she'd take the child back. So how could he trust his heart to her too?A very good romance, well written and recommended."
positive,"Great cd, but.............: First off, I recommend this cd to anyone who likes modern rock. All the tracks are listenable, and I usually go through the cd nonstop. The only problem is that System of a Down isn't all that musical. They tune down their instruments down one step, then just hammer away with no effort. While I do appreciate this album, it doesn't offer that much musical talent."
negative,"Affirmation / Quote Book. Not a Goddess book.: This book is only for people who like affirmations or quotes from famous women. There is no artwork other than the cover. Not for people who collect books on the Goddess. Also, it is a mini-book."
positive,"Paul Hoover's book is a wonderful compilation.: The poems in Totem and Shadow, especially the newest work by Hoover, are so strong that style seems to drop away, as complex truths are given to the reader. This is a poetry of great intensity and brilliance."
positive,"Should have listened!!!! (update) Not that bad.: I didn't listen to everyones reviews or updates on this brewer. It was great.........while it lasted. 4 months later and it's dead. These brewers have a serious defect. The pumps are no where near heavy duty enough to last. We used our brewer once or twice a day and now its DEAD. For the money, they stink!!Update: 5-1-12Ok Ok. Maybe I jumped the gun a little. I think the problem was when you use K-cups at altitude, they build pressure. If you stick the cup in the holder and just close the lid, the pressure release from puncturing the top, blows coffee back up through your brewer. My wife now puts the cup in and pushes it down to puncture the bottom first. We haven't had any of the issues we had before. Brewer has been going for at least 1.5 years.BTW, those Ekobrew cups are the way to go."
positive,", This got me into anime: I just like this anime This is a stunning seriesI havent meet anyone that doesnt like itand the artwork and play couldnt be more realisticThe story is out of this world!! and keeps you hooked with eyeballs wide open I NEVER BEEN SO INTENSE WATCHING A MOVIEseen several anime but this is my favorite, because every episode is worth it, not like other anime where halfway you start to enjoy it, It just want to make you tell other people about it."
negative,"The Not So Grand Finale: Avoid unless desperate for a Kingfix. This novel blows a gasket in the final ""act."" Up until that point, I was hooked, especially after two hundred odd pages of a gripping chase sequence. But the long heralded return of the Duddits character, while moving, is also a major let down. King is one hell of a yarn spinner and sustains interest throughout, but tale's end is an abrupt fizzle, downgrading this into a routine X-FILES pastiche. DREAMCATCHER does not continue King's winning streak begun with BAG OF BONES and then THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. No worries, he's sure to get back into the groove in the future."
negative,"It only remembers the time, not the station.: Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a [$] clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you"
negative,"Not worth it: Not impressed with this blanket. It is soft, not tough or lumpy at all but is very light and carries little weight. Not much inside it at all as far as stuffing. That's not so bad, though.The fabric is the big problem. It is silky in the way a sleeping bag is, not like a smooth cotton-based fabric. The blank is very loud in motion with friction and has a rough synthetic texture.Other than that, the ""clover"" color I ordered is not the very light green as shown on Amazon, but a darker pea soup green. ""Puke green"", perhaps. I sent mine back within minutes of taking it out of the plastic bag.Might be a soft-enough servicable throw, but not for the price I paid. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this."
negative,"Pseudo scientific mumbo jumbo: This book is a strange mix of some sound nutritional advice mixed in with a load of pseudo scientific mumbo jumbo.As with most pseudo scientific works, it makes sweeping assertions without bothering to offer any backup.If you are not well versed in either science or nutrition, it's likely that you won't be able to distinguish the good advice from the waffleIf you know even a little about science, you'll probably get quickly irritated with all the gibberish in this bookIf this is supposed to be a book about good diet, then why the authors take such an anti-vegetarianism hard line is difficult to fathom.It's virtually an established fact that vegetarian diets and low meat consumption diets are far healthier than the average Western diet.When it's so apparent that the authors are clueless about science, I guess you can't expect any better.My advice is to give this book a miss and read a good book about nutrition.I'd recommend Patrick Holford's Optimum Nutrition Bible."
positive,Stripped: I was very pleased with my last purchase. The delivery was very prompt and shipped in perfect condition.
positive,"Yeesh, how does she put up with those brats?!: As a novel that follows the plight of a young woman forced into the position of a governess to make ends meet, Anne Bronte's Agnes Grey has of course often been compared with her sister's more famous novel Jane Eyre. And as a love story, it has also been compared with the novels of Jane Austen. It even reminded me a little of the cautionary morality tales that had been popular up to that time, such as Defoe's Moll Flanders.Personally, I enjoyed it more than Pride and Prejudice, but not as much as Jane Eyre. It just doesn't have the same scope and depth. Anne's second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, on the other hand, does, so I would recommend that over this. That said, this is a nice little novel, and interesting, and sometimes very funny. Well worth reading."
negative,Heavy Duty Appliance Rollers: Rolled out from under appliance when attempting to move appliance creating potentially hazardous situation. Would not recommend this product.
negative,This movie dropped !: Come on ! Rated PG-13 !? This is why the movie was stupid ! They made Robocop act funny and dumb. What happened to Peter Weller the orginal Robocop !? The story in this movie is lame but the only credit I give this movie is the fact that Robo has the new weapon which connects to his hand and the flight pack.
negative,"A waste of time.: This book, which tries to act like a full sized book, but is so full of larger print...larger spacing....huge margins...empty pages or nearly empty pages....chapters cut into 10 or 15 pieces, so that they can then insert MORE blank pages....is a big, fat, waste of time. It pretty much reads like a 13 year old girl's diary...sappy, and not in touch with reality. I love a good tear jerker...this one was neither good OR a tear jerker. The only good thing I can say about reading this book is that I got it at the library and did not pay for it....I'd have kicked myself if I had paid for it. My advice? Don't waste your time OR your money. How this ever made the Best Sellers List is beyond me."
negative,"Amazon sends torn book: This is the second torn book I have received from Amazon. Both books were brand new and in excellent condition EXCEPT for a razor-cut through the first 50 or so pages, including the cover. I am becoming increasingly worried about Amazon's quality control. I know I could send the book back, but the truth is, they should get it right the first time."
negative,"bored to tears: I am baffled as to what people love about this CD. Lauryn Hill's image is great, but her music is below mediocre. And it's boring. Just because you have a positive message doesn't make you a good musician. There is no funk. The beats suck. That Thing is one of the most irritating songs I've ever heard. Seriously, people... You need to think for yourselves. This album is all hype and no substance. Oh, and comparing her to Marvin Gaye is just a crime. The Fugees are great, but don't be mislead. If you value funk at all, don't buy this CD. I gave it 2 stars for the positive message, but the music deserves a 1."
negative,"TSTL Heroines ...: I bought the new Kindle version of this book. Believe it or not, I just started reading Julie Garwood and have liked her work for the most part. I loved The Prize and The Bride. Lions Lady was okay. I did not like Ransom at all. The heroines both seemed weak to me and the heros were always in control and getting the better of the heroines. The heoines never stuck to their guns on any issue and there were several badly needed ""hero grovels"" scenes missing. Honestly, I didn't feel the love. Oh well. I'm thinking of trying the Secret just to fill in Judith and Ian's story, but I'm not sure I'm interested anymore."
positive,"TRUE story of a REAL hero: If you want to read a true and fascinating story of a real hero--both during and after the War--this book is for you. If you want to rant mindlessly against Kerry, like a lot of wackos who reviewed this book have done here, then skip it. Perhaps they'd prefer to be led by an overprivileged bozo who slid into the Champagne Corps of the National Guard--the unit where all the rich boys hid out--and then went AWOL even from that, to work on a pro-war Senate candidate's campaign.As for me, I'll stick with the real heroes."
positive,I have always enjoyed this story: I wanted to re-read it before I see the movie. This is a nice compact edition I bought before my Kindle arrived.
negative,"Well, at least there was man candy. But...: You have to listen to boy band music for almost the entire movie! Frankly, I can't imagine anything more horrifying. It made me flashback to my much younger sister's infatuation with New Kids on the Block.I'll need my teddy bear to get to sleep tonight.I've seen a couple of other DeCoteau films (Witches of the Caribbean and The Sisterhood) and both were much better than this."
positive,"Outstanding description and explanation of Christianity: As the title implies, this book is about what all Christians hold true; i.e., the commonly agreed upon aspects of faith held by all Christian churches, regardless of denomination or doctrine. For anyone wanting to understand the basic tenets of Christianity, or anyone wanting an introduction to Christianity, this is the book to read. I've already read it four times. I love this book."
positive,Fluke: Fluke makes a great product. if you want quality repeatable measurements Fluke is it. Although I wish the case was bigger
negative,"Disappointing: I was very disappointed with this book. I consider myself to be a great fan of Lawson-Roby's previous novels, but this book left a lot to be desired. The same points and ideas were belabored again and again and it took away from the interest of the book. While I LOVED 'Behind Closed Doors' and 'Here and Now' I wonder why the wit and skill reflected in those books was not seen in this one. And if I had to read one more insignificant detail...To the Editor or whoever advised her to add more scenery or bulk to scenes: READERS DO NOT LIKE INSIGNIFICANT DETAILS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PACE OF THE STORYLINE. Kimberla, get a new editor.."
negative,Pretty Girls with a thin plot: The movie stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress. The only problem is that she is stuck with boring dialog and a weak plot. If you are going to make a movie about a crazy bar and the lifestyle of a young bartender in New York City why would you make it PG-13. How wild and crazy can you get. Its kind of ironic that the cover of this movie reminds me of a Spice Girls poster. Stay away from this one if you have any interest in a plot and charachters.
negative,"Do not read this book!: To start this book is so dry it could catch on fire. Also description in the book, ha there is none to be spoken of. This book has been called Charles Dickens greatest novel, not even close, save your time, and money for buying a better book."
positive,Good update book: I bought this for my greatniece. Her father has one from long ago and is so glad to have the updated one now for her
positive,"You're not getting it: I just love this movie, and I think the reviewer doesnt understand it ! First, it's nothing but a comedy, even though you laugh quite a lot. But this also shows that, whatever happens, it's not the adult, pretty and intelligent one who pays. It's the young banal and quite slow kid. I think that's what Gus Van Sant always wants to show in his movies. God ! I love Gus Van Sant !"
positive,i got my moneys worth.: Theres nothing about this product I don't like. I read all the reviews before i bought it and i extremely happy with it.
negative,"soft-core porn masquerading as historical fiction: I see from the other reviews here that I will be in the minority, but this may be the most moronic book I have ever read. If you care anything about history, avoid this book at all costs. Frankly, if you have any self-respect at all, avoid this book. I doubt my opinion will change the Cult of Philippa Gregory, but I feel compelled, by the very awfulness of this book, to speak my mind. It's no more than a jazzed-up Harlequin Romance with a few historical references thrown in for kicks. Absurdity on every page and an insult to anyone of intelligence."
positive,"A REAL TALENT!: My daughter eagerly anticipated the release of Clays CD, and I must admit I'm hooked as well--How refreshing it is to have a young pop star that [doesn't use] vulgar lyrics,condone violence, drugs, etc... or has sold out! Unlike most of todays CD's, this work contains several songs that are excellent, and could become big hits-In fact, I like ALL of the songs! Several of the songs give me chills, even though i have listened to the CD a dozen times...the songs grow on you..and that voice~~~its just something special! Clay, thank you for helping me believe there are good, decent people among our youth~!This young man is a great talent, and role model for my kids.Today's singers could learn alot from this kid.I will buy his work anyday.Hurray for Clay! *****!"
positive,"Rob Inglis is unabridged: Paul Jones is referring to the BBC version. That one is abridged. The Rob Inglis version is unabridged and is 10 CD's long. If you loved the book, you'll likely love Rob Inglis' reading. If you didn't like the book, you probably won't like this. But what are you going to do while you're driving to work if you don't listen to this ;-)? I give it 4 stars because I don't like opera and Inglis sings the songs from the book. Wonder where he got the music."
negative,"Pervasive Silicone Enhancement: Flat lighting, cheap sets and costumes, dull dialog, wooden acting, and a goofy plot; even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie. Zero stars should be an option. For more inspired soft porn, check out the work of Andrew Blake (andrewblake.com)."
positive,"A family heirloom that will last forever: Normally I avoid the 'used' versions of products, after all, who wants a scratched Paris Hilton CD or a less than pristine jock strap? This time, however, I made an exception and was pleased with the result.I won't detail the precise reason for my purchase, suffice to say that Show-and-Tell at my son's school was not the overwhelming success we expected when ordering.Despite this setback, I acquired a bargain by paying $10 for second-hand ore that was originally purchased last March for $30. Crazy, huh? Paying a third of the full retail price for a product that will continue to glow and give pleasure for several millennia.I feel sure that my radioactive purchase will become a much-loved Muffin family heirloom, handed on to future generations of malformed descendants who will dribble and squawk at its deadly, blue aura."
negative,"Don't buy it to see Pierce. He's been in better movies.: I actually went to see this movie in the theaters and I was severly disappointed. It's not that the acting is bad, but the movie as a whole is lacking. The main thing that kills it is the pacing. It is REALLY, REALLY slow - almost painfully so because after sitting through it, you really want an ending that at least makes it worth all your suffering . . . and it never comes. Very bad movie. I strongly suggest passing this one over."
positive,"Oh, lighten UP, folks!: I liked this little venture into one woman's obsession. She wasn't trying to write Larousse's Gastronomique, for heaven's sake. It's just a fun little chicklit type of memoir. Quirky and cute. Just don't look for big a big emotional work of art or for a cooking how-to. Go aloong for the ride and enjoy it."
positive,"Great fun: Bought this for my three year old grandson. He loves it; plays in it; naps in it and has great imaginary adventures. The only thing to watch for is climbing on it, not a good idea because it will tip over. All in all a very good buy."
positive,"MUST READ MUST READ MUST READ MUST READ MUST READ: This book does not even relate to the popular card game ""Magic: The Gathering"". The characters and settings are unique and unforgetable. This book is a must for any library. Teri McLaren takes you out of this world and beyond. It is a book of love and friendship and a dieing world that must be saved by good and evil. About the love, it doesn't occur till the end guys so don't freak out just because I said love"
negative,Cheaply made.: This is the very cheap product that does not measure up to the standards of the other Pampers diapers. I would recommend not to buy this but the 186 count instead.
negative,FUSION BLADES: I have been using gillette products for 40 years. These Fusion blades do not klast 5 shaves the green strip turns white and the blades are not that sharp. You get about 5 good shaves and then forget it.I am moving to an electric shaver because these blades don't last like previous blades from 2 years ago that Gillette made.They are expensive and they do not give yu many shaves.
positive,"Top-Notch: I had already heard a couple of SDRE's cd's before I heard this one, including their 1999 Live disc which contains a good number of the songs featured here. Probably because of that I actually like the live versions of ""Pillars"", ""Guitars & Video Games"", ""Every Shining Time You Arrive"", and ""100 Million"" better than the versions featured here. But this is still a great disc and probably worth getting just for ""Roses In Water"" and ""Days Were Golden."""
positive,"Wonderful Bible Story Book: We bought this Bible for our niece's 1st Communion. I think it would make an excellent 1st Communion gift! We also bought the Golden Book Bible, so that we could compare the two. My husband and I both liked Egermeier's better. I tried reading it to my 5 year old, but it didn't hold his attention. I think it would be a great Bible for a 7 or 8 year old. It has a picture about every 2 pages. I think that if it had a picture on every page, it would hold our son's attention. The Golden Book Bible was very good, and it had pictures on every page. I think Egermeier's is easier for a child to read and understand! I have really enjoyed reading it myself. I have a hard time putting it down! We will definitely buy one for our children when they get a little older, and we look forward to reading it to them! I also thought it was a great price on amazon!"
negative,Not What I Expected!: I was disappointed to discover that this is not really a soundtrack from the movie. The only thing this CD has in common with the movie is the song titles. I would have preferred a combination of Elton John signing some of the tracks and the voice talents from the movie doing some of the others. This CD is more like Road to El Dorado set to elevator music. 2 thumbs down.
positive,Excellent no frills stand: I was looking for a simple way to park my new Bianchi roadie and thought this may do the trick- it did. Extremely well made (for a BB stand) with a non-marring coating anywhere the stand touches the frame. Picks the back wheel up far enough to easily make drivetrain adjustments as well as remove the rear wheel.Best stand at nearly any price- but for under $10
positive,Great Diaper Product: These Pampers have been a steady part of our baby's diaper regimine since birth. I find the product above average with the only complaint the occasional torn tab.
negative,book: Might recommend if purchaser/reader were a history buff. Found difficult to follow and keep up with. Not a book I would recommend for easy reading.
positive,Great game for the family: Great game for the family. Also great at younger children parties. Lots of fun for the children and brings back memories for the adults of old Disney movies.Highly recommend it!
positive,great product- just a slight drawback: This is a great product. My little one can now be on the boat and I do not have to worry her undoing her life jacket. I also love the fact of built in sun protection. The only draw back is that the bottoms are big. She will have to wear shorts also to cover her.
positive,"Beware of static electricity!: OK, this amp does what is says it will do. I use it to drive some speakers from my flat screen TV audio output. Some people are confused how this amp operates but the manual can be downloaded before you buy it so read it before you buy.Now, for some interesting information. There is no external ground on this amp so there is no ground on the electrical plug. I walked across the carpet, touched the amp, static electricity hit the the outside case, and smoked rolled out of the case. It fried the circuit board. Luckily it was still under warranty."
negative,"Extremely disappointing: Like many reviewers here, I admired and enjoyed ""Like Water for Chocolate"" and was intrigued by the concept of this book; therefore I was unpleasantly surprised to find myself slogging through one of the worst novels I have ever read. By the end, I was actually angry and felt ripped off by the publisher, who should never have put this thing in print!Vague, self-contradictory, confusing, and generally inarticulate, ""Malinche"" reads like an early draft that needs to go through many, many revisions to be publishable. I'm afraid the translater can't be blamed for all that's wrong with this mess."
negative,False advertisement: Hello all I normally don't complaint about my orders from Amazon but this one really upset me I was planning a pajama party for my daughter and thought having 3-d movies will be a cool item. Received my movie and comes to find out the movie wasn't in 3-d format. To make a long story short the company needs to get into details letting their customers know that the movie isn't really in 3-d.
negative,"Horrible: I take great care of my phone, yet this phone has a camaera that no longer takes pictures, it constantly drops calls (for whatever reason), it has horrible ringtones (unless you like really bad elevator music or the sound of very light bells). It's slow to respond to dialing too.I have had this phone for one year."
positive,"Works like a charm: When we converted over to Time-Warner digital phone service, we could no longer connect via the wireless modem jack. so, we hooked this up to our Linksys WRT-300N Wireless Broadband Router and it works like a charm updating Tivo all the time plus a bunch of extras. Good Price (less than the Tivo website)& quick delivery."
negative,Romeo & Juliet: I got this from Amazon. I think it's a copy the quality is so bad.I bught this to replace a video I had. I've loved this movie since I was about 16 when it came out - gee 40 years ago.
positive,"Incredibly easy, but iffy instructions: Very easy BUT the instructions didn't work on my Thinkpad T61 with Vista. I hooked up my new 320GB drive via USB and inserted the CD and got nothing. Tried executing the Autorun and still nothing, so I powered off the laptop and rebooted with the CD in, and the menu came up. It took 1 1/2 hrs to copy 130GB to the new drive. All in all, and VERY good experience and I end up with my old 160GB drive as an external USB drive."
negative,"Waste of time and money!: This book has very little to do with cooking or the amazing Julia Childs. It is more an account of Ms. Powell's chaotic and unremarkable life. References to Julia and Paul Childs are sparse and oddly placed. Time spent chronicling work in the kitchen (which was fairly interesting) was vastly overshadowed by incoherent rants about family and friends. Attempts at wit were forced and not particularly funny. I generally smile at chiding by opposing political parties; however, I found Ms. Powell's persistent irreverent generalization of Republicans as unemotional and ""piggy"" annoying. I was particularly troubled after reading the cold account of her job consoling families a year post 9/11 as ""emotional sh** work"". WOW - I'd rather blow my nose on my t-shirt than have this woman hand me a tissue! I feel a little defeated but will be closing this book for good on page 99. I reccommend checking this out at the library and saving the hard-earned $25."
positive,treasure island is treasure!: I really liked treasure island but their is one thing: it's not a book for four year olds. it has a lot of people dieing an d getting injured in that book. I would say you could give treasure island to a 6-13 year olds.enjoy!
positive,"The best CD ever! I LOVE her!!!: This is my favorite cd that I have ever bought. It be 'Every Ghetto, Every City' (my personal fav.), or Doo Wop (That Thing) her soulful voice and introspective words inspire and move me. I have never really followed someone's caree like thisr before, but she is just so inspiring. I feel really bad about the rumors that went around about her when she was with the Fugees. I LOVE YOU LAURYN!!! I am her #1 fan. She is the best. You have to get this album. She deserved every Grammy that she got! Go Lauryn!"
negative,"You won't like it if you loved the book.: I loved the book, and this movie was a huge disappointment to me. The Ed Leland character is completely destroyed."
positive,Not bad but there's better: This is the 2nd choice out of what we've tried so far. My absolute favorite now is the Durex Ultra Sensitive. If that's what you're looking for its the way to go.
negative,Stupid absolutely horrible!: This was one of the worst movies! I have seen to date! If you enjoy this there is something truly wrong with you. How can one man get away from danger so much?!Its special effects nothing more and a lot less! Brendan Fraser is a bad actor with a soon to be short movie career! Boo to the people that enjoy this movie! Hooray to the people who understand what I mean!
positive,"Very solid follow-up to Wiretap Scars: I think Sparta have finally carved their niche with this album and proved that they can do amazing things post At The Drive-In. Amazing songs pretty much throughout, especially with ""While Oceana Sleeps"", Breaking The Broken"", ""Travel By Bloodline"". The closer to the album ""Splinters"" is absolutely amazing. All in all I think a very strong follow-up album to Wiretap Scars. The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 is because I think the production and mixing is a little below what Jerry Finn can do. But again this is simply my opinion and I do realize that they were probably going for a ""rawer"" sound that the last album."
positive,"how many dresses do you have in liliac?: i want 5 of these dresses with a white sash but in liliac i really love the dress pl.us i will be getting married in 5 months!!! this dress took my eyes away it wiuld mean soo much to me if you had more than 1 dress.if you did i would be the HAPPIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD. THIS DRESS IS THE COLOR I WANT AND THE STYLE AND ITS ""FREAKY FABLOUS"" I LOVE IT TO DEATH!!!SIGNED,ALEXANDRA WILLIAMS"
positive,"Terrific!: This movie is great! The story is interesting, and I love the superb acting and special effects. This flick was truly watchable and enjoyable. It will have you glued to your screen! If you love scary movies, don't pass up this one!"
positive,"Music for strong, intelligent women: This albumn is easily one of the best I've purchased this year. As a dancer, I find that many of the women that I work with feel the same way. It is certainly one of our favorites, especially ""Ex-Factor"" and ""Zion"". Ms. Hill seems to be s strong, intelligent, young woman who speaks up for herself and promotes solidarity both within and between the genders. I found the music soothing and her voice soulful and intoxicating, like a lyrical Toni Morrison."
positive,"good: they taste very good.and product was in good condition, but way to much packing penuts, i would prefer somthing biodegradabl or recyclabl"
positive,"Go, Go, Go Buy This!: This is my ABSOLUTE favorite movie in my collection, surpassing Pretty Woman, Forrest Gump, Star Wars, and Austin Powers. I can't complain about ANYTHING with ""Joseph..."" besides I don't get to watch it enough! I loved how great the sound quality, image quality, acting, costumes, sets, music, and everything else I can't remember right now were. Not a single complaint. I guarantee that If you love theater, you'll love this show. A great investment at ANY cost."
negative,"It's time for human slaves to meet their masters!!!: And these masters are Michael Bay and his computers!!!And we have no one but ourselves to blame!!!This movie is like a 2.5 hours car crash. When you think it can't get any worse - it does.It would deserve 2 stars if it didn't have any human actors. But Michael Bay is actually controlled by his computers, and they made him put these humans in this movie to make us suffer even more!!!This is all I have to say. Transformers IV is coming soon to the theaters near you. Preorder your tickets now!!!"
positive,"Just as great as the first season: The story line is even better in this season. I think it can do without as much nudity as it has, however, same with the first season."
negative,"Great Book Horrible Print: This print has many pages in which the first letter(s) or last letter(s) are missing from the page. It also has the sloppy markings of a previous reader as part of the reprint. I did verified this was not a used copy by comparing the notes on the pages with a fellow student, and it is part of the book. I recomend this book, just buy a print from a different source/company. There are many prints, I beleive many other students had a simple looking version with a plain white cover."
negative,"Undecided: When I bought this mat a couple years ago, I was looking for a longer mat. I'd find my nose or toes hanging off one end or the other of my standard-size mat (I'm 5'10""). The lack of PVC and the somewhat Earth-friendly material led me to this mat rather than other longer mats.Early-on, the mat was both too sticky and too slippery. The slightest moisture made it slippery, and it is sticky when dry. Two or three times I stubbed my big toe in a big, painful way going from down dog to lunge. I do have a certain amount of excess girth that gets in the way of some maneuvers but I never stubbed my toe while using my first PVC mat. My leader thinks the mat is too sticky. The slipperiness was gone after a month or two.I practiced twice a week for much of the past two years but practice only sporadically now. There are some cracks but no tears or gouges. I would not buy this mat again."
negative,KO for Ready to Rumble Boxing: This game stinks. No question about it. I would rather be a pokemaniac then play it. 8 LOUSY PLAYERS. 3 SECRETS. I SAW THIS UNDER THE EDITOR'S PICK. I HOPED GREATNESS BUT NOW I THINK THE EDITOR IS LOCO EN LA CABEZA. Last thing it BARELY rumbles
negative,more than bad: this is for sure the badest and most boring film i have ever seen (i swear).8 women in one room for more than 5 minutes is by far too much.and everybody has to sing a chanson.this is horrible !
positive,"An honest look at goaltending: I found this book to be an honest look at the world of hockey goaltending from mites to the pros. My son, who is a youth hockey goalie, enjoyed reading Robb's history and hockey philosophy. A good book for all hockey goalie parents, especially those who are new to the goalie world."
negative,"Awsome movie. Bad Blu-Ray: Without going into detail about the movie. Which was great. I have to say Warner is horrible at Blu-ray transfers. The picture is very soft through out the movie. And Dobly Digital? Come on Warner. Thats good enough for your cable/dish box, but not blu-ray. This blu-ray does not take full advatage of what the technology can achieve. I would like to see a remaster of this blu-ray."
positive,"rich and smooth: Tracy Nelson has been a complete class act for decades. I grew up on her smokey, rich voice and music, and this CD is as grand as all of them. My favorite song on this recording is Livin' the Blues. It demonstrates her incredible range, humor and sassy, heart felt passion.Buy this, and any music you find by this amazingly talented woman. It will fill you with warmth, and leave you wanting more. I could listen to her voice for eternity and be content."
negative,"Inept. Flat. Read Something Else.: This feels like a book-length article from a pulp crime magazine like ""True Detective"" or ""Crime Story Monthly."" It's curiously bloodless (figuratively & stylistically) and lurches along without highlighting the flashy stuff. It's almost a complete misfire-- if you want to know about Legs Diamond, read something else (William Kennedy's fictionalized version, for instance)."
positive,"Quick, simple game.: it's a simple game that plays quickly; no strategy involved, it's totally luck. Even older kids are willing to play it. Not a lot of educational value, except maybe learning to count objects up to 8 and learning to be a good sport."
positive,"The Transal Saga: I would recommend this book to anyone who seeks adventurous and mysterious books. This book has many problems and conflicts that result and rise up to the main idea or plot of the story. The characters throughout the story are very different and strange but in all, they all have vital parts in the story that affect the main problem, and small problems that arise in the story. The details are distinctly described, and are very clear. When you start to figure out what will happen next, something unexpected pops up and changes the whole story. After starting this magnificent book, you will never want to put it down. I myself thought the book was an incredible adventure book."
positive,"A really nice wifi adapter!: First off, you DO NOT have to use the wireless utility that comes with it as others claim. Just extract the driver from the CD and point Windows to it when it starts the hardware installation. I keep the driver on my flash drive and have used that to install this adapter on tons of PCs in my office.Pros: Smallest on the market, handles all encryption types, USB 2.0, good range.Cons: No cover for the USB plug (no big deal).I have 2 of these devices and they work great. I can get about 40-50' of range which isn't bad for it's size (what do you expect?)The thing just works, and is one of the only adapters that can handle WPA 2. For the price, it is unbeatable."
negative,Bathroom Tapes - Drone On: These songs are awful. The muscianship is awful. The singing is awful. No one other than the son of a rock and roll icon could possibly get this through a record company. The young Dylan sounds worse than sad voiced Bob Dylan on a really bad day. I mean a really bad day. And why is he trying to sound like his father anyway.Singing this awful should only be done in the bathroom with the shower on full blast or maybe out in a forest where no one can hear. I had to rate this on a scale of 1 to 5 stars so I gave it one star. Believe me it should have no stars. Drone on.
negative,a love supreme: I most have not read the smallprint---who-- tell me who --orders vinyl today--- I sent this to a friend and was floored when he said he got a record instead of a cd --so that is my issue
positive,"Great Acid Rock!: Haven't purchased this, but having listened to the whole album, I sure will!. I suggest any fan of acid rock/heavy psych, hard rock, classic rock, blues rock, or early heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath get this album today."
positive,"The best of the film versions: Even with a few 70's haircuts and the occasional turtleneck, this film DEFINITELY shines as the most true to Shakespeare's original play. Stunning in on location staging and supurb acting, the film makes you feel as if you are actually there with the characters. Excellent casting. The gangs of boys are sufficiently hooliganish that you can anticipate the tragedies before they occur. You almost feel the love growing betweem Romeo and sweet Juliet. Overall a fabulous love tragedy."
positive,"Mayo Clinic Family Health Book: What an amazing source of information!! It is a definate must have for new parents. This detailed, yet easy to understand book offers specific chapters by age including newborns. It give prevenative information on health & safety including tooth care, controlling stress and travelng abroad. Of course first aid and diseases and disorders are the bulk of the book. It is well written easy to use and include helpful illustrations and photos. Every household should have one, but certainly families with children, of any age should have this book to refer to."
negative,Has some promise but just boring!: After I read the reviews I was expecting action and tons of it or a little gore. Now im not going to lie there are some great parts but very few. In my opinion this movie was just basically boring but if you like long droning conversations and drama where it shouldn't be then this is a must see!
positive,"IZ alot of fun for the younger kids...: (I'm speaking as a mom with all boys..) I purchased IZ for my son of 7 who absolutely loves it! IZ's movements and noises are very comical but can drive a parent batty after a while. But in a kids view this is Great. My son can listen to his music on it by linking his CD walkman to it. (also works with MP3 or IPod)Or just listen to IZ's personal music making abilities, which your child can mix up and manipulate by making faster slower or different sounds etc. It is like a personal speaker and a fun friend. My two year old also enjoys IZ and that where the durability comes in. IZ is very surprisingly durable. I was even considering getting him one. Now as for the older set like age 13 (Forget it!!). My 13 year old thinks its ridiculous and the IDog was the way to go there. IDog is the bomb, cool, rad, or whatever these older kids say now a days.....lol Other than that IZ is awesome for the younger set!"
negative,"Movie is awesome. Service comperable to Wal-Mart: I already know that I will love the movie. The problem is, shpping is and always has been a deceit. Even f you pay for next day (Prime Member), you will not get it on time. There is no other solution for law-abiding people."
positive,"D Day Invasion of Europe: A well told story of the events leading to the Invasion of Europe in June of 1944. Acting, for the most part, is excellent. Even in black and white background scenes appear authentic. Some of the acting, such as John Wayne and Richard Burton's, is a little iffy in places. They both look tired and a little out of place. Overall, an excellent film that dramatizes the complexities of one of the most massiveinvasions in 20th century warfare."
positive,"Disturbingly lovely..: Sometimes, a movie with a (mostly) all-star cast backfires. There are too many cooks in the kitchen, so to speak. Not so with ""The Dead Girl."" It helps that each of the interwoven plot lines are presented as vignettes, each one poignant and beautiful in it's own way. It really allows the viewer time to get to know the characters. Brittany Murphy was amazing, as was Marcia Gay Harden whose portrayal of the dead girl's mother will stay with you. Great movie. [...]"
negative,"Cleverly imaginative yet unbearingly boring: As a summer reading assignment, I was assigned this book to read and appreciated Orwell's sense of imagination. I reccomend this novel to anyone who is interested in the world of make believe. People who appreciate descriptive writing will certainly enjoy reading this novel. However, this novel will probably not appeal to people who enjoy novels that tell stories. I found the novel extremely boring because it is all about Orwell's vision of an unstable society, it does not give the reader the desire to read on."
negative,"Appalled - Very disappointing: I love Enya with all my heart and was anxiously anticipating this new album. I love how her music is so moving and mood altering.However, this album absolutely stunned me. It does not possess the mood of the other albums, has nothing consequential to say, and sounds more like an album of children's songs with the simple melodies and highly predictable lyrics.There are 2 songs on this entire album that I ""like"" but none i love.I hope future endeavors do not duplicate this horrific collection.I guess I will have to wait another 5 years."
positive,"Shakespeare's best!: I love this play. The words are so beautiful, and the story never fails to draw me in. And I must admit that the language is hard to understand - but the New Folger Library is the way to go. I love them! They make it so easy and understandable for all of us who don't say ""wherefore"" for why. So if the language is intimidating you get the New Folger Library. But getting back to the play itself, it is fantastic, and something that everyone should read."
positive,"HIGHLY ENTERTAINING MIX OF SCI-FI, CRIME STORY AND DRAMA!: An interesting idea that blends family and crime drama with sci-fi elements to make a highly entertaining movie `Frequency' is one of the most entertaining films of its kind. Quaid and Caviezel hand in very good performances and make the unbelievable, well.... believable. Usually these types of films can be confusing and tedious, but because the center story about a boy losing his firefighter father at an early age is heartfelt, it makes up for any minor plot holes. Look fast for a young Michael Cera as John's son. The DVD has an excellent transfer and there are some interesting extras including commentary, deleted scenes and feature-ettes."
positive,"MARTY AT HIS BEST ... BEING MARTY!: Those in charge have had the good sense to take the masters of the MASTER and, by re-enhancing the tracks digitally, are allowing Marty to be heard as he should be heard in this special CD from Epic's AMERICAN MILESTONES Series. Everyone loves Marty Robbins ... and this collection is a credit to the man and his music."
negative,"Cant Compare to Earlier Albums: The album has a couple good songs- higher with kanye west which has already been on the radio in chi town- but more importantly if you liked their earlier albums you will be let down. Songs like ""nobody's home"" just are not on this album....i like do or die- but dod did not do it for me..."
positive,"Comforting: I got this for a friend who had a miscarriage. I first read it and was very moved, often to tears. An excellent book! Recommend getting this along with two other (in my opinion) even BETTER books: I'll Hold You in Heaven Remembrance Book and Mommy, Please Don't Cry."
negative,not compatable with the jawbone.: produce is not compatable with the jawbone. design does not provide a snug fit to the bluetooth unit. a waste of money
positive,"Radiology registry review book: This is a great item... however, a cd is not included as previous versions used to. Now you can go to the website and purchase an online study course for $15 a month! Great alternative to buying the book! Wish i knew that before i bought the hard copy!!!"
positive,new light for an old model: since my truck is old i was having a hard time finding the replacement rear taillight. as soon as i went to amazon there it was. and at a reasonable price too. i received it in no time at all and it came in perfect condition. i have used amazon for several items so i dont know what i was thinking not going to their site first!! great job amazon
positive,"Boogie Woogie needed a Title Cover!: Although the music of this CD was just what I needed to teach a lesson on early jazz and it's influence on the artist, Mondrian, I was disappointed that it did not have the cover sheet shown or any information about the artists. The CD package was broken.....Other than that, it was fun to play it as the children in my art class painted their own version of""Boogie Woogie Broadway"" by Mondrian.Art Specialist --- Las Vegas, Nevada"
positive,"ten stars wouldn't be enough!: What a wonderful CD for children and adults. Well-crafted songs with clever lyrics and talented musicianship make for a 50-minute delight. ""At the Bottom of the Sea"" has clever word-play, ""Surfin' in My Imagination"" has some fine surf guitar and inspires some uninhibited dancing, and a great rendition of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" should have you singing in no time with your child. Each song is worth hearing over and over (and over), and this CD is money well spent. My son laughs and laughs at Eighteen Wheels on a Big Rig,"" and I am partial to and extremely appreciative of ""The Banana Splits (The Tra La La Song)."" After all, four bananas make a bunch and so do many more!I am incredibly impressed with Ralph Covert's abilities to reach a child's imagination without shutting out the adults. I am going to buy this as a gift to all parents I know, and I also plan to purchase Ralph's World's first CD. This CD should be at the top of anyone's Wish List."
negative,"Too Christian: I agree with the other people who thought that This book was too Christian. Neither the front nor the back of the book mentioned how Christian the book was. I would have returned it as soon as I realized, but I had already written in it (it is a WORKBOOK after all). I felt totally ripped off and let down"
negative,"Disgraceful: Bantam was in a hurry to monetize their Nero Wolfe license and did not even bother with a basic proofread. The printing is littered with mistakes. Some are just annoying; others completely confuse and alter the meanings of important sentences. Since the writing is from another time, phrases and phrasings are different; thus it becomes difficult to tell whether a sentence is strange because language has changed or because some idiot at Bantam couldn't be bothered to pull her finger out of her nose long enough to do a classic justice. Possibly the worst offense is that the back cover blurb needlessly reveals a major plot point that happens towards the end of the book. I will NEVER buy another Bantam book again. You shouldn't either. These illiterates shouldn't be printing PennySavers let alone a classic of detective fiction that still sells robustly and enjoys a healthy popularity. Disgraceful."
positive,Of Mice and Men is a great book: Very poignant...I read this book because my sons' 9th grade English class is reading it & I had never read it before. The movie starring Gary Sinese was on the weekend before I read the book as well & I really enjoyed the movie.
negative,"Maybe if it was 22min but painful at 48min...: Younger children may enojy nuts talking and mice fighting the soldiers but all of this comes in way too long at 48min. I initially thought the Amazon Editorial Review by Doug Thomas was alittle harse but after watching this, it was kind. It may have had some chance at 22min (think of your favorite Christmas Special - most are for a 30min time slot - with the Rudolph classic set for 1hr). I knew Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and this is no Rudolph!"
negative,"Incredibly stupid: Possibly the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life. Reese Witherspoon is a beautiful and talented actress but this movie doesn't give us any evidence of that. Horrible acting, horrible writing... in fact, just about everything in this movie is horrible."
negative,"Built-in Obsolescence: When I first received the B70 model, I was pleased and purchased a wide variety of flavors. I showed it off to my friends and we had wonderful ""coffee klatches"" over the 4 years that this brewer worked. But then the problems started. Just take a look at the videos and you will see what can go wrong. Once the problems start, they escalate and you start wasting k-cups, doing a variety of cleaning tasks in order to produce a cup and over time, the one-cup feature loses any value because you simply cannot produce a cup of coffee. The only solution is to buy a new brewer...well the performance of the old brewer certainly discouraged me from buying a new one, even at discount!"
positive,"Warms the heart.: I am not American. Nor do I usually buy this kind of music. I heard a few tracks by accident in a music store. But... we live in dark times, someone singing about friendship and brotherhood makes me feel that there are some good people out there. Its simple messages warm the heart. If the heart is true, the music is beautiful no matter whether the music is rock, rap... or in this case American Folk Music."
negative,"Be Careful!: I bought one of these shoe racks and some of the parts were made out of plastic. My rack lasted about two months before it bagan to fall apart. The stem, shoe holders, bottom and handle were chrome metal, but the spacers between tiers that keep your rack from wobbling were plastic and broke off. I just threw mine in the trash. I wear a women's size 9-1/2 to 10 and could not fit 6 shoes on each tier. I also had problems with the distance between tiers. Some of my shoes hung too low and kept me from adding shoes underneath. This rack may be better made than mine, but you need to check it out."
positive,Good Product: I did't buy this card for gaming purposes but to watch movies that I had on my computer. The quality was not that bad and setup was fairly easy. Just follow the directions and your set. This card comes with an s-video output so it doesnt look that bad when it goes on tv. The price is pretty good and it does its job. The only expensive thing was when i had to get long audio and s-video cables.
positive,"Good Book: Even though this book was written in the old world style, I really enjoyed it. I like the way the character was able to overcome all of the obstacles that in her way (i.e. the old world style of thinking about women)."
positive,Classic: This hat is Classic. The original green and white color looks vibrant. The hat keeps your head cool and even blocks out harmful UV rays. It fits great and adds another dimension to your casual wardrobe. I recommend this hat to anyone!
negative,The worst of the trilogy!: This was suppose to be such a great movie and it fell very short of all the expectations I had. I have been a huge fan of transformers since they came out in the early 80's. It's sad to think this could be the end of them on the big screen. I hope they redeem themselves by doing a 4th installment. Bring in Hot Rod and Ultra Magnus from the original series. I for one hope they don't end on such a poor film. I was very disappointed! As hard as that is to say. It was really bad.
positive,8701 Rocks!: Hey guys! Everyone has gotta buy Usher's new cd 8701! It rocks the house! It is the best cd and does not suffer from the sophmore cd flop that most artists deal with. You'll love Pop Ya Collar with its edgy hard core vibes and you also get your share of ballads with songs like U Remind Me. I promise you even if u are not an Usher fan before this you will either become an Usher fan because of this cd or at the very least will be happy you bought this cd. It is so amazing!!! Usher is definetly number 1!!! There is no one else out there like him. He leaves all the other r&b crooners in the dust.
positive,"The best book: The Transall Saga is a really good book. It has a lot of action in it like when Mark is in the woods and a buffalo thing chases him. It also has a lot of suspense in it, for example, when he follows the monkey human things to their tribe. I can relate to this book because he had to build a shelter and I used to do that. I think this book is for kids from 10-16 years old. I liked this book a lot.Andrew W."
negative,"Contrived and unbelieviable: The plot for this film is completely contrived. The entire plot relies on itself for advancement and framework, and doesn't follow any sort of universal logic or boundaries.If you're a fan of mindless suspense, then you might enjoy this film, but if you expect your movies to provide you with a believable framework, don't bother.The plot to this film is so outlandish and so poorly explained that it made it completely unenjoyable for me.You basically figure out the entire scope of the movie within the first 30 minutes and then just watch what you predict unfold before your eyes in it's painfully contrived and cliche form.Save your time and watch a different movie. This one is not worthy of your time."
positive,"Absorbing: The elements of the film are well portrayed in the characters interaction. While there are some changes from the book, the film does stand on it's own."
negative,"Cannot recommend: The headphones are comfortable enough. Not quite as nice as the photo suggests. The actual headphones differ, slightly smaller/cheaper looking.The headphones cut out some low frequency hum, but in doing so add hiss.My main hope was that I could protect my ears and listen to a portable mp3/radio while doing chores such as mowing the lawn or vacuuming.They help a little, but the volume is boosted when the ANC is activated so it's difficult to know if the improvement is due to ANC or higher volume."
positive,wish I knew it was this easy: I went way to long with a seized nozzle on my hose. I didn't realize it was so simple to repair.
positive,"Super Fun CD: This is worth importing. Its a wonderful collection of the best of Hi-5 songs. Your kids will be singing and dancing right away. Even parents will love it!Plus, who can resist the darling Aussie accents!?! :)ENJOY!"
negative,Does not work!!!!: I purchased a pond liner and my husband dug the hole a little too big and I figured I could order another smaller liner and piece them together to give me the few extra feet I needed. I used this to seam together the two liners. I did what it said to do. I made sure I did it right cause I did not want my pond to leak after I filled it! I waited the full 24 hrs before filling it. IT DID NOT WORK!!! I am now spending more money to purchase a larger liner. DO NOT DO WHAT I DID!
positive,"Excellent: The book which is a kind of a sequel to an epochmaking book by Alec Wilder is simply indispensable to anyone who is interested in the field. It is both intelligent and entertaining, as a book on popular music should be. Highly recommended."
negative,"This book was very boring: I had to read this book for school, and it is one of the most boring books I've ever read. There are three sections, and all that the main character, Montag does in the first section is meet a girl named Clarisse and talks to her once or twice and starts ""considering"" his job as a fireman burning books. This should give you a rough overview of what the book is like: way to descriptive. A lot of my friends in the class didn't even read the second or third sections because it was so incredibly boring. There are so many metaphors and stuff that it is so hard to understand the story.While I hated this book, if you're the kind of person who likes sci-fi books with a lot of metaphors, then you should read Fahrenheit 451."
positive,Perhaps one of my favorite books: I admit i thought this book seemed strange and somewhat corny from first reading the synopsis. But after begining to read i was imediately swept into Bradbury's vision. I could clearly see every detail and believe in the fantastic events. This book also provides a wonderful discourse on good and evil and the nature of each. As all good literature should it does not provide answers but asks deep questions.
negative,"Dont buy it!: I have bought this player 4 month ago and it died recently. I was very careful and played my MP3 cds just few times. Dont waste your money, dont buy it."
negative,"Didn't grab me: I usually like books about weird science, but I have to say that this one didn't grab me-- maybe because I got to it right after reading Kip Thorne's book on Black Holes and Time Warps. It's ok, but didn't seem special."
negative,"THATS BULL: I BOUGHT THE EXACT PENCIL SHARPENER AT WALMART FOR 10 BUCKS AND YOUR CHARGING ALMOST 46 BUCKS FOR THIS, YOUR OUT OF YOUR MIND, WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS AT ALL."
positive,"The Hobbit: He keeps us entertained for sure, and constantly finding adventure, usually by accident. See where his adventures take him. The End"
positive,Anastasia Rocks: The CD is great. Every song has its own personality and that makes the entire CD very diverse. I especially love the mixes on the second disc.
positive,"Good shorts: Good quality, style, and sizingToo bad this style has been replaced with one where the UA logo is silver"
positive,"Good product: My baby has sensitive skin, We try most of the product in the market and never found any of them delivered to the promise including Pamper baby dry thin. Finally we stick to this one and seems to be OK for my baby except few small rashes my baby is comfortable with this one"
positive,"The Hearth and the Salamander: Bradbury creates a world of extreme censorship that is our future, where firemen burn books and houses in which they are hidden. I first read this book in 8th grade (not because I had to, but because I WANTED to), and it had a profound effect on my life. Guy Montag is an anticonformist at heart caught in a world where conformity is the only path to survival. I respect those who gave it 1 or 2 stars, though, because if you are forced to read any book in school that you don't want to, you are going to be inclined to dislike it. But, if you read it once, try it again. You will see the underlying tale about society in general. A very depressing, but very moving book, I recommened it for all, young ones for the plot about anti censorship, and older people for the underlying plots."
negative,"Did not fit: Despite entering my vehicle info for a 2006 Chevrolet Silverado, this gas cap does not fit my truck. In order to return the item, the I wold need to pay about half the price of the item purchased so I am stuck with a gas cap I cannot use."
positive,"Pleased with this author's originality: I borrowed this book from a friend after he simply raved about it, and knowing that I will read practically anything (and am impressed by very little), he was curious to see what I would think of the book. Well I have to say I really loved it. It was written in a very unique style, not too 'modern commercial fiction' but not to 'literary fiction.' Mr. Malfi has a style like a mixture between Stephen King and Ernest Hemingway, and I would certainly recommend this book be read by anyone looking for a brilliant new voice."
positive,"great product, simple yet elegant looking!: great product, simple yet elegant looking! very satisfied. on time delivery. Looks and feels as advertised. Had an issue with size, returned and correct size was shipped immediately."
positive,"Excellent CD: Great CD. Wonderful Music. Would Like To Know Where And When This Was Recorded. Please Release More Of This Music With Merl AndMelvin. So Sorry Merl Is Gone.Buy This CD, You Will Love It."
positive,"Comfortable Novelty: These flipflops are both well-made and comfortable. The strap material is soft and didn't cause any irritation or discomfort from day 1. The arch support is made for someone with moderate arches so it should be comfortable for most people. They are designed to give reasonable traction when wet or dry so they're great for a day at the lake. The dram only holds about an ounce of fluid but hey, it's more for fun than anything else. If you're planning to use these to sneak your alcohol into a sporting event then I'd come up with another strategy. But they do make a good conversation starter. The only reason I give them four stars instead of 5 is that the dram is made of hard plastic and so reduces the cushioning in the heel area somewhat. But other than that I'd recommend them."
negative,"Very Small: Very small product. If you have a small Child, then this will work for them. Normal Adult, pass on it."
negative,"wish they would have copied the vhs version: Long time Allman Bros. fan. I own the ""Live at Great Woods VHS"" and was excited to purchase the DVD. I am disappointed with the interruptions and interviews during several of the songs. ""Blue Sky"" hardly exist due to an interview with Dickey Betts. It just appears that this recording was hurried and it is much shorter than the original VHS tape. I would purchase the tape instead of the DVD. Bummer...."
positive,Great book: This book is the first one I purchased for my new kindle and for good reason. I love Tolkien's works and in light of the release of the first part of The Hobbit in theaters I decided I should read this book. If you only buy one book for the kindle make it this book.
positive,"The Transall Saga:school reveiw: Wow!This book was excellent,I don't think there's one part I disliked.I would rate this book with 5 stars because it was outstanding how Gary Paulsen matched the characters with what they feel.I liked how Mark was able to survive in another culture ,after being transported from the desert in a blue light to another planet in another time.I really liked how Mark became a very important member(a warrior) of the Tsook.I thought it was a little weird though, how Mark fell in love with the cheif's daughter,Megaan, from the Tsook, rather then the slave that he had known from when he first got there.I was suprised at how many people turned against Mark and wanted to be the one to stop the outlander.If you like science ficton and mystery, this is the book for you."
positive,"very exiting series: I read those books, few years back and i'm still thinking about them, i would love to have another book that would continue the story. I miss the caracters. Is there ever going to be another book??????????????????????"
positive,Installed in 2004 Miata: I use this CB in Miata road rallies. I mounted the hand-held unit between the two seats on the back panel. It can be heard easily in normal driving conditions without the need for an external speaker.
positive,"It Truley Is A Remix: I have always been a Destiny's Child fan. This CD is so nice, and I happy that the songs are really remixed. Michelle also has a hot new single! I can't wait for her CD to come out!"
negative,"Good points, but misleading applications: I teach statistics and research methods to both undergraduates and graduate students, and am always on the lookout for news articles, advertisements, and the like that illustrate any poor and improper uses of statistics in the ""real world"" in order to get students to recognize them more easily when confronted by them. So it was with great expectation that I came to this book. And I would have to say that I was not disappointed in the statistical points raised. They are all right on the mark. However, as I read through example after example of the misuse of statistics and statistical thinking, I began to notice that the bulk of them were made by liberals. The ""subtext"" message that was coming across, intended or not, is that only liberals use shoddy statistics to further their political agendas. I bought the book originally with the hope that I could use it as a supplementary text for my students, but because of this perceived bias I won't."
positive,"good game, bad purchase: My daughter loves the game but the game kept freezing up until it didn't work anymore. We had to purchase another one at the store. The game is fantastic according to her."
positive,"Land of Confusion: Interesting film set in Vietnam brings up the whole issue of morality in war. Can morality exist in war? Is there such an animal? In such a graphic film depicting death, carnage and rape where does one draw the line? Penn is excellent as usual but Fox probably cast for his mere presence, as a character of virtue may be the real casualty here that diminishes the impact of the director's intentions. This film contains one of Ennio Morricone's best latter scores."
positive,"Love it!: I couldn't be happier with my Farberware Classic, 6-qt.covered stock pot. I could not not find this item anywhere else. I tossed out my old beat up teflon coated pot. This completes my set of Classic Farberware. I highly recommend it. It cooks and cleans beautifully."
negative,Looks cool but....: This game looked great on the box and that is all I got out of it.Due yourself a favor and check to make sure your system can handle a game of this high speed and graphics.Called the game company waste of time then checked with my computer manufactor another waste of time.If you think you got a old system then stay away from this game unless your looking to waste a day trying to install and it will never happen.
negative,"Don't buy: What ever you do don't buy this product. It not only came in used but beaten to death. It was scratch, dented and chipped. This is my 4th time writing a review on this product all other attempts have be block like I suspect this one will be to."
positive,SACD and DIvas makes great sound: I saw this lives on TV but I can feel more exciting when I litened this CD(SACD)! The condition of recording is very good and you can know fully with SACD audio technology.
positive,"Good software to learn the basics: This CD is ""fast, fun & user friendly"" just like the good people at Talk Now say. It plays on both Windows and Mac computers. I recommend it for what it is. A beginner's learning tool for the essential words and phases. A useful feature is you can learn using YOUR native language as you have choice of over 70 languages. I tried Chinese as I know it reasonably well and it worked just OK - I feel they designed it primarily for those with English as their 1st language. So if you American, Brit, Aussie, or Canadian this is a good beginner's guide for you.It's best feature is it's pronounces the words in both male and female voices as many Tagalog courses do not pronounce the words for you :-( You will enjoy the games and tests to measure your progress and it allows you to print your own dictionary for handy reference. I just wish it covered even more of our Tagalog words. Just incase I forget them.hehehe"
positive,Stunning: Dickens takes you on a ride that will keep the reader enthralled throughout. Prepare to be sucked into the story and become very attached to the wonderful (yet dreadful) characters of this novel.
positive,"Shifters, shifters… And more shifters: The Magnus Pack series is a series that is set in the same world as Shelly Laurenston's Pride series. This series takes place prior to the Pride series and according to the author will not have any more installments. This series is a little bit more edgy than the Pride series but it does have its share of laughs."
negative,"Bratz Helmet: When I ordered this product, I didn't see a size chart and I was sent a size that is not suitable for the purpose intended."
negative,Not worth it: It doesn't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed. I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor. Atleast It has a taste.
negative,"They sound like a bad cover-band: I heard them on Howard Stern and loved the acoustic versions of the songs. I thought that is what would be on the CD. Well, it's not. What is on the CD just sounds like watered down versions of the real songs. Also, it sounds like it was mixed poorly. Overall, a very bad album."
negative,Where am I?: This book caught my attention the first 300 or so pages and then I was totally lost. What in the world! King was all over the place and there were so many characters that I couldnt keep up with them all! I am not real big on alien books but I thought that I could at least deal with it some but this was so stupid that I just quit reading it. I just wasted my reading time on this book. Would not recommend this book unless you have alot of patience and dont mind being confused the whole time. Very bad book King.
positive,"What a ride: Whew! What a ride. What a terrible ride into the lives of three sad, miserable lives. Blanche comes to stay with her sister, Stella, after Blanche's life deteriorates. Stella has married and is expecting a baby, but her life is anything but cozy and warm. Stella's husband, Stanley, beats his wife and drinks heavily. Everything in this story echoes, No Way Out, and You are Doomed to Misery."
negative,"Too much UMA!: This predictable film would have been better spent on the cutting room floor. I'm not particularly certain why this film was green lighted by the studio. I suppose given it's two stars, one being a true star, the other being Uma. The writing is predictable. If you've viewed the trailor, you've seen then entire film. This film drones along with no true entertaining purpose. It's ridiculous. Were it not for a MINOR starring role by Streep, I would have turned this film off within twenty minutes of it's start. Don't bother, you'll be fine without this predictable diatribe."
positive,"Better than the Novel (for once): I don't get to say this very often, but the Prince Caspian movie was better than the novel.When I read through the Narnia series a few months ago, I had the thought that for the books to be made into good films, the Disney writers were going to have to add some scenes, to fill in the blanks where C.S. Lewis' high creativity fell short.This film does a great job filling in the blanks. 4 or 5 key scenes were added to the film rather seemlessly, and moviegoers who haven't read the books in a long while won't even realize which scenes are new to the story. I had a hard enough time distinguishing, and I just read the novels.All that said, the movie is a good time...humorous, action-packed, tense, and creative. More than anything, the film paints an accurate picture of Lucy's faith journey with Aslan and how her siblings learn with her.Fun times.--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"
negative,"Ugh!: The nicest thing I can say about this movie is it is really bad. There's talent to burn in the cast but they should have burned the script instead. The script is so terrible it makes ""Never Too Young To Die"" look Oscar-worthy. Rosie Huntington is like a blonded Megan Fox but without the charm or gravitas (which Ms. Fox isn't exactly awash in either so you can tell how wooden her replacement is). The movie is actually painful to watch for teh first 2/3 but at least some of the action scenes in the final third are cool enough to make it not a total loss."
negative,"This one should have a warning label...yikes!: So, I saw the ad for this one and thought, Chris O'Denell as a loveable Bachelor, looks like fun...but was I ever in for a let down. THis movie is just awful. And on a side note, the depiction of 30-something women as gold-digging, husband-hungry, cometitive maniacs is rather bizzare."
positive,HDMI Cable 6ft: The cable works great and saved me a lot of money. I am very pleased with my purchase.
positive,Very good: I bought this lens cap as replacement for my stock on canon 70-200 F/4 none is L lens after I misplaced it.It fits perfectly good build quality from a plastic.
negative,"SOME GOOD, SOME BAD: HALF OF THE MUSIC IS GREAT, THE OTHER HALF IS JUNK.I DON'T CARE IF YOU REMASTER THE BAD HALF, ITS STILL LOUSY.HERE IS A BREAKDOWN OF THE GOOD & BAD.1.

positive,"Standard Motor Products Neutral/Backup Switch: Standard Motor Products Neutral/Backup Switch, you really have to careful to verify which of these you buy. Apparently NOT all Toyota Camrys have the same Standard Motor Products Neutral/Backup Switch. My Standard Motor Products Neutral/Backup Switch does however work GREAT and the price was right!"
negative,"Unfullfilled: I found I was drawn into the movie and the mysterious story line the longer it went. And actually I thought it was an excellent mind twisting plot, very well acted, and very well directed. But that was the problem. Just when I was ready for the 'cycle' to be broken and for the movie to come to conclusion, there wasn't a conclusion! It just started over again. Many folks can overlook the ending and rate this movie highly, but I can't forgive the ending and how unfullfilled I felt after watching the movie. The ending was such a let down and completely ruined the enjoyment of the first part of the movie for me and I felt like I had just wasted an hour and a half."
positive,Love this sink: I love this sink...I purchased the white....it can be cleaned easily with BLEACH for STAINS and Mr.CLEAN ERASERS for POT & PAN MARKS...so easy!!!!!! Love the deep large bowls...perfect for large items!
positive,Classic: This is a classic by Charles Dickens. I read it to my kids every Christmas. What more can be said?
positive,A classic: One of the best sports movies ever made. A true classic. Need I say more? If you've never seen it you're missing out.
positive,"great read: This is one of my favorite books of all time. Since the download was free, I decided to give it a shot. I was very pleased with this Kindle version. It's been a long time since I've read the book, but it doesn't seem to me that there is much, if anything, missing from this version.If this is your first time reading this story, don't be put off by other reviewers who claim that it is too wordy or easy to get lost. It really isn't. And if you've only seen the movie (unless it was the Richard Chamberlain version, which in my opinion is the only good adaptation)be prepared for the ending to be different.Overall a really great, must-read book!"
positive,"Good: It's not my # 1 favorite Disney flick but Pinocchio is good. I have watched this with some of my younger relatives and the little ones seemed to get a little bored and fidgety after awhile but the older ones seemed to like Pinocchio more, anyway I think it's probably an essential for the collection of Disney videos."
negative,Don't buy this book: Very bad nasty language and sex take over this book. This is an insult to Julia Child and French cooking. The author's 15 minutes of fame are over. Purchase a Julia Child cookbook for inspiration.
positive,"None: This book is a great fantasy. I love this amazing adventurous book! I am still in elementary school and this book was recommended to me by a friend. I think it is an amazing adventurous fantasy that most pre-teens will love. You will love this book if you have read Fablehaven by Brandon Mull and Leven Thumps by Obert Skye. My rating would be all stars if not for the two or three swear words. That is why I said pre-teens will like this book. Even though it swears it was recommended to me by a friend and she is a total bookworm(so am i) plus she has good taste so i had to read it. I love this and hope you will too (if you buy it,of course)."
positive,"Great book!: I have been using this book for several years and absolutely love to make gifts for my friends using the book. The recipes are easy. The book describes how things are to be stacked in the jar to look their prettiest, and the instructions are very easy to follow. My friends love the gifts. I have used the prepared jars for my own ""quick"" cookies and the cookies are delicious! I highly recommend the book."
negative,"Borring!: With the exception of the scene of Ethan trying to recover the gold disk in a cable and the final action sequence with the helicopter exploding in the tunel,this movie is simply a piece of junk!I fell asleep on most part of it and i was very disapointed with it!Mission Impossible 2 was clearly better,though not that spectacular,but i really enjoyed that movie.The fact that this was a big success is beyond me.Skip this one and get the sequel.You'll be glad you did!"
negative,"Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium: Not ever using this product, I probably wouldn't buy it reading the reviews. Also knowing that so many people that have the Fisher Price Peaceful Planet Fish Aquarium and are happy with it. If your looking for a Peaceful Planet, there are plenty on E-Bay."
negative,"Stick with Krakauer!: What should have been insightful, educated insight into one the higher accomplishments of a human, turned into a self absorbed effort at self affirmation and ego stroking. Don't waste a nickel on this one."
positive,"captivating: As Montag's fire captain tells him, ""You ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed."" An important difference between this futuristic society created in 1953 and George Orwell's world of 1984 is that Orwell's government was top-down while all the minorities (of every race, color and creed) in Bradbury's dystopia got together to burn everything that offended them. In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself."
negative,"Worked good for a month then became like any other rice cooker: First off, we are an asian family and we cook rice everyday through the cooker or through a pot.This rice cooker was great for a month. The rice came out perfect and very soft and moist during that time. Now the cooker cooks the rice dry and hard like any other cheap rice cooker. Though we cleaned the lids and maintained it well, it's like one of those cheap cookers now; you just have to guess whether to add more or less water to get good rice.For the price, I expected more especially when you can get basically 5 or 6 decent cookers at Costco. In the end this machine will be like any other machine."
positive,"Probably best Fighter game to Movie!: Great movie, i grew up watching this movie every other week. A must for the children of the 90s! a must for it in HiDef"
positive,"A Modern James' Story: I think this is the most modern of Henry James' stories. Young Maisie's parents divorce and then seem to spend their lives using her to get a teach other, until they develop other interests. Sadly, the story resonates today - immature, self-centered parents and the children that they create. Henry James' insight into the life of such a child is brilliant."
positive,"The only light motorists notice: I have installed this set on my bike to get the attention of NYC motorists who, from experience with other warning devices, would otherwise fail to notice me or the bike in traffic. Having tried LED flashing lamps and other warning indicators, the strobe is the only lamp visible in daylight and sufficiently intense to prevent motorists from opening doors, making turns and blissfully changing lanes in ignorance of a cyclist. My only complaint concerns their reliability. I had to have two sets replaced until I got one that kept working. The lamps deplete AA batteries rapidly and I recommend using 2000 mAhr rechargeable NiMh cells which will provide an operational life of a couple of hours."
positive,"Interesting novel!: Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent novel that I highly suggest to those who like well-written, thoughtful books. The plot and the story in general are extremely interesting- not only due to the actual events, but due to Fahrenheit 451's frightening connection to our lives. The futuristic, dystopian setting where the government has censored all forms of high art and learning, and where humans have 'dumbed down' to an unbelievable degree, gives way to a story where humankind fights with itself to regain a civilized society.Fahrenheit 451 is no doubt a critisism of our society and a scary prediction of may be ahead. Don't miss this wonderful novel!"
positive,Pravani leave in treatment: This product is absolutely awesome! Me and my daughter both use this on a daily basis. This product works for all hair types and considering we live where it is hot 9 months out of the year it leaves our hair soft and healthy looking even with the humidity! I highly recommend this product to everyone of all hair types
negative,"They almost had me fooled ...: I was almost ready to seriously consider Margulis' and Sagan's revolutionary theory until I read Sagan's update, in which he writes ""Because chromosome arrangements differ slightly in closely related mammal species (e.g., dogs and wolves) that no longer breed with each other ...""Everybody knows that wolves and domestic dogs CAN breed. You can buy wolf/dog hybrids from breeders such as http://www.dogpage.us/wolfdogs.htm.If one of the authors is this removed from common sense, I wonder about the rest of the theory. And I wonder if his mother knows what he's up to."
negative,"Fades Fast: Initial I loved this CD, but it didn't last. Soon the tracks started to grate and seem just a to predictable and calculated. Maybe I'm being unfair, I am comparing to Leftfields Leftism, which still sounds original and fresh 6 years on. Compared to them Moby is twiddling in the sandpit."
positive,"Emmy-winning pseudo-documentary about US nuclear terrorists: This is a fairly unique and highly-praised TV movie designed, like Orson Welles' radio broadcast of WAR OF THE WORLDS, as if it were real coverage of a nuclear terrorist event on the East Coast of the U.S. More realistic than its contemporary, THE DAY AFTER, this film scared the network enough that they kept running disclaimers throughout its presentation stating that it was not an actual news event. If that description and the subsequent Emmies aren't enough to whet your appetite, I'd say this is just that much more scary in the post-9/11 era. Not a well known TV movie, but it seems even less like fiction now with its urban nuclear terrorist threat and non-stop news coverage of the events. Worth seeing."
positive,Julie Garwood's best book yet!: I loved this book! This is one of those stories that I really hated to see end. The characters had wonderful personalities and I found myself laughing out loud quite often. I would love to see a sequel with Ramsey & Brigid & bring all of the original characters back!
positive,"Good But Could Be Better: I enjoyed this movie a lot and I thought it was very entertaining, but it could have been a lot better. I'm definitely not talking about the special effects, which were amazing. And some parts were genuinely funny. But the acting was not that great, and parts of the plot were confusing. Other than that, I thought it was pretty good. :O)"
negative,"wow.: This is an hour and a half of my life I can never get back. There was a guy sitting around smoking weed one day in his apartment and had a ""great idea"" for a film. Through a series of unfortunate events he was able to not only find people to be in such an abortion but also the money to film it. The actor's greatest acting acomplishment was convincing someone they could act to score a role in this. If I could watch glitter in place of the time that I took out of my life to view this, I would do so. twice."
positive,"A Rare Find - Wonderful!: I've been searching for a book that really makes me laugh, characters I can relate and enjoy and a story that keeps me interested beyond the first 30 pages. Well, I found it! ""Cocktails for Three"" by English author Madeleine Wickham had me completely enchanted. I found the three main characters (Maggie - the pregnant one on maternity leave / Roxanne - the dating a married man one / Candice - the trusting and will do anything for a person in need one) all well rounded and hilarious.""Cocktails"" goes beyond your basic ""friends forever"" novel and dives into real life problems and the effects those decisions have on you and those around you.I found this book really unique and sparkling with touches of really dark and edgy comedy. A great find! I hope others will discover this secret of mine."
negative,of mice and men: I SPECIFIED I WANTED THIS BOOK IN HARDCOVER AND THE JERKS SENT ME A SOFTCOVER. iT IRRITATES ME TO PAY FOR SOMETHING I WAS TOTALLY AGAINST AND SPECIFICALLY ASKED NOT BE SENT TO ME. i WILL NEVER USE OR RECOMMEND THIS BOOKSTORE. gOOD LUCK TO OTHERS WHO OPT TO USE THEM
positive,"Soul Sauce and Sonic Tonic: I'm 40 and missed this music while I was listening to nursery rhimes on my close and play. I read where Steve Kahn jazz guitarist extrodinare said that SOUL BURST changed his life. I needed to buy 2 cd's to make the shipping worthwhile so I got SOUL SAUCE as well. The 1st 3 tracks are very good and indespensible(sp) listening. The next few tracks literally put me to sleep. I think its the warbling ethereal(sp) sound of the vibes that does it. And then along came MING. A track originally left off the album release. Straight ahead jazz, not samba, plenty of brass, perfect tone, an incredible sounding track. It woke me up and had me listening hard. This track will now be in my permanent demo repetoire along with SARA K...Brickhouse and Jeff Berg...Saturday Night at the Cadillac Club. Essential listening along with SOUL BURST."
negative,"Beowulf films: I liked the 13th Warrior, at least they tried to recreate the world that actually existed, but in reality it was based on a novel by Michael Crichton called Eaters of the Dead, not Beowulf. Making a film version of Beowulf in the time it existed would be possible, but with no help from the poem. It's images of lands and places are sparse. The original poet liked to describe the insides of rooms, gold, gifts, weapons, battles and skirmishes, but the setting is very sparse, the filmmaker must supply his own image of the setting. I agree however, that this was not the setting the film needed, it suffered as a result. F/X can't make up for poor writing, nothing can, which is exactly why you shouldn't see this film. I was disappointed that Chris Lambert would condescend to play such an empty role in a film that is like a small child with anemia, there's not much hope for it."
positive,"Raised body temperature and metabolism: This product was suggested to help with low thyroid--and ""cold body syndrome"" which is related to low thyroid.My morning temperature was often 96 degrees or lower. Within one half hour of taking this guggul, my temperature was up to 97 or 98 and stayed there for about 4 hours. Increased metabolism is giving me more energy and I am losing weight.This brand seems to be working better than the other brand I took for a while."
positive,"This album shows what Oasis can really do.: Defintley Maybe is not like any rock album I've ever heard. Liam's vocals are the kind that linger in your head for a long time. ""Rock N' Roll Star"" and ""Married With Children"" are the best songs on it if you ask me. ""Supersonic"" is also a good song. Defintley maybe sounds like someone took the talent of Jimmy Page, Elton John, The Beatles, mixed it all together in a big pot, then molded it into a CD. Yes, this CD is THAT good."
positive,"A Treat For All!: As the father of a teenage daughter who was about to see the screen play based on this book, I am probably an atypical reader of ""Little Women"", but I enjoyed it none the less. ""Little Women"" tells the charming story of the March family as the girls grow over several years. Presenting an idealized view of life beginning in Civil War era New England, it gives a glimpse into the world of their class and time. Occasionally it is refreshing to read a book which is just plain enjoyable, without devious characters and subliminal agendas. This book is a delight, even for those who are not, and never were, Little Women."
positive,"want to be inspired?: A must read for anyone who wants to be inspired! I have more of a drive to read, write, enjoy life, take risks and explore. I have been recommending this to everyone I know since i finished Chapter 1!!"
positive,"i agree this a is good movie: Constantine is based on the D.C. comics characters ""Hellblazer"",i also dont know too much about the comics, so was gradingjust as a film and have to admit it rocked the house!!!Way to go Keanu, the cast and director. Constantine has somegreat special effects, the acting is particulary good fromeveryone from Reeves to Rachel Weisz.He plays a sort of witchcraft doctor who performs exorcismsand gets rid of demons. Suddenly, well I dont want to revealtoo much, but lets just say that this movie is worth the moneyto see it in the theater. So see ""Constantine""!!!"
negative,"the worst book in the entire night world series!!!: this is the worst night world book that i owned and im sure every1 agrees this 1 [is bad] alot/ first of all gillian is a stupid little sissy whining girl who cared only bout the stupidest things - being popular and getting her crush david to notice her obvioulsy she wasnt being herself she was just like every1 else- wanting to be popular like it was the most important thing in the world to her thats is very stupid of her 2nd the plot was really stupid and boring and didnt mention any vamps, witches, or shapeshifters or the night world in particular. another reason why this book [is bad] the only part i like is that there's an apppearance by one of my fave characters of the series-ASh i swear he would be more funner 2 read if the book was only bout him!!! angel wasnt a good character either and david [wasn't either]!! i recommend teens 2 not by this book it really stinks alot!!"

positive,"Can't wait no longer.: Ever since I discovered that this was being released on dvd, I have been bursting out with retarded noises of delightful joy! I am very excited about the release of my very favorite televisionsitcom,Threes Company, because of the many laughs I get from watching it mostly. You will not regret buying it, and that is a guaranteed guarantee!"
positive,"IMHO not for children: I found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad. But when it turned to what I guess is an opiate trip, it got downright creepy. Gave me nightmares.I'd heard of it forever and I'm glad I read it. But I would not read it again."
negative,Very disappointed!: This perfume is just AWFUL! Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can't be returned!
negative,"Lid shattered second use: The second time that we used this pan with the lid, the lid shattered. The pan itself is quite functional but having the lid shatter the second time of use merits the rather poor rating."
positive,Pampers: For the price it's great.It comes in a timely manner & price saving.I recommend to try the 3month subscription.You can beat the quantity & price.
negative,Misleading: Blood sugar is only part of the equation. Following this type of diet causes high acidic levels which causes illness. This diet is nothing new. My grandmother followed this kind of plan back in the late 40's because they thought ALL carbs were bad. Today we know that the brain needs glucose to function. Carbs + high fiber leaves lower net carbs. And diabetics need a balance---in fact all people need a balance of healthy whole foods and exercise and fresh air. One more thing; my grandmother died of a massive heart attack on this kind of plan. She was only in her 50's.
positive,"Kanno, amazing as always: In my opinion, Escaflowne has the best soundtrack set of any animated series; all of the Escaflowne soundtracks are amazing and you wouldn't be disappointed if you had only one to choose from. That being said, this one is my personal favorite as it contains what I consider two of the most beautiful songs in the entire series (""Farewell"" and ""Arcadia"") plus a couple of performances from Maaya Sakamoto (whose voice is also divine). If you can get your hands on a copy, I strongly suggest getting this one. And while you're at it, check out other works composed by Yoko Kanno - she's simply amazing."
negative,"Interesting for only the most hard-core WWII historian: An interesting premise for a WWII history book - this is a compilation of the writings of various German soldiers in Allied captivity who wrote about thier experiences on the Russian front - unfortunately most, if not all, of the personal experiences and anecdotes have been left out. It reads like a fairly dry battle manual, describing Russian tacticts, the 'personality' and leadership style of the Russians, etc. very little in the way of interesting anecdotes. This is a valuable piece of researh - useful for a historian doing specific research on tacticts on the Russian front, but is little more than a dry overview. If you are looking for an interesting narative, this is NOT it. If you are looking for battle tacticts and examinations of the russian way of combat - possibly as research material for a book or research paper, this may be for you, otherwise, you may want to avoid this."
negative,"Bar Tales in Book Form: Brzezinski displays the acumen of a tourist. The abundance of factual mistakes in Casino Moscow damage the author's credibility when he makes a rare reference to Russian businesses, which were the supposed topic of the book. As a collection of anecdotal stories, this book was more entertaining than what you'd hear from an average guy in a bar. But as a source of information about Russia in the 1990's, it is not WSJ quality."
positive,"The Greatness of Gemmel: Narnia's Next: Winter Warriors was the first David Gemmel book I became entranced in. If there are any readers out there who have already been absorbed by the magic of Narnia, I believe you will find an even more scintillating, awesome adventure here. A good compare to Narnia, David Gemmel vividly maps out a world, a land of good, evil, and as one of his characters puts it, ""the shade of grey inbetween"". But unique is this book in that never before, not even in the fantastic tines of Tolkien, have characters been developed, fleshed out, and woven together by destiny's bonds than in Gemmel's reads. Winter Warriors is one of his best. In fact, he causes his readers to become so attached that the emotion conveyed in the text leaves the page and becomes sentient. There were points in this novel where I cried, sections that made me laugh, and parts where I felt dread and horror. Can fantasy really be so powerful? Reader, it is up to you to find out."
negative,"College Book that simply teaches grammar that is so confusing that it's just not worth caring about.: My review is based on the content.... it's mostly about ""how to"" write the ""correct way"", and the current ""rules"" of literature. I'm sorry, but times have changed, and some of the things expressed in this book are simply not said/written in modern society."
negative,When the Wind Blows: A fantastic book so real.....however the copy I received wasn't in very good condition - the spin was all broken so I was a bit disappointed in this....the first time I have received a book in such condition.
positive,"Jabra EarGels: This is an excellent product to use for a bluetooth headset. I use it with the Samsung Wep200 and it fits perfectly. It comes with several different sized gels, which can be shared with family members. This product finally allows me to use my bluetooth without worrying about the headset falling from my ear during normal use."
positive,"fantastic machine just consider 2 points afore you buy: fantastic rice and oatmeal. the only problem i've encountered is that there is no ""steamer tray"" - i mention because ""the ultimate rice cooker cookbook"" has recipes that use a steamer tray - whatever. i wasn't planning on that to begin with but might be helpful if available in a fancier zojirushi. the other consideration is capacity. it's ok for me because there are just two of us, but this size could be wrong for you if you have kids and want leftovers. (i get sick of the same meal after two days and that's usually all i get in terms of leftovers - perfect!) this machine is worth it's weight in gold for oatmeal alone. incredibly easy to use and to clean. i'm reviewing because other reviewers helped me make my decision and now it's my turn."
positive,Up From Slavery: I chose this book in an effort to learn more about black history.It gave me a chance to go back to school and really learn about the life of an exceptional black manand his contribution not only to his race but also his country.I found Booker T Washington to be an excellent read and I urge anyone interested in learningblack history to read this book.
negative,"For whom the bell tolls--for fans of thier back catalogue: This single, and most likely (though it saddens me to say it) the album from which it originates [Always Outmanned...], is dissapointing. This statement is only for those who love Experience and feel that the Prodigy peaked with Music For the Gilted Generation--folks who were introduced to the Prodigy via Fat of the Land will probably love it. It's got plenty of ...slurred ""singing"" by Keith Flint and mediocre beats that compliment it very well. I've been waiting many years for signs of a return to the powerful, compelling, and complex beats of old, and it looks like I might have to just give up. My catalogue of 15+ Prodigy lps and eps might not be getting any new friends any time soon."
positive,"A well earned Caldecott: Puss in boots is always an enjoyable tale, probably because it is so based on wit.I really enjoyed these illustrations they are glowing and friendly, making one feel very comfortable as they turn the pages. Puss is adorable, the expressions that our fine illustrator manages to convey through his feline features are just fantastic! Time and time again I was always dissapointed when I found a page that the lovely cat was not on.A wonderful additition to any collection of books for children or lover of fairy tales."
positive,"Interesting: I bought this book after seeing the movie ""Ghost Dog - Way of the Samurai"". I didn't really know what to expect, but the book has some very interesting aspects on life and ways to live, that still work extremely well in todays society. I have at many times found myself in situations described in the book and even though some answers might be a bit hard to understand, the book has given me answers, or perhaps ways to answer/respond, in different situations. It's not really a book you read from cover to cover, but pick up and read a couple of ""rules"" every now and then, which after a while are in the back of your head, ready for use.I highly reccommend this book to pretty much every one."
positive,"Mummy Mia!!: Brendan Fraser and Co. are back for a second round with that nasty mummy with twice the adventure, special effects and even a 10 year old son for the two lead characters. While this sequel is lacking some of the charm of the first film, it is still a satisfying ""summer"" action film that you can sit back with a tub of popcorn and enjoy. Wrestling star, The Rock, makes a cameo at the beginning of the movie as the Scorpion King, a character whose story helps set the plot in motion. Fans of the WWF star may be disappointed as he is only in the film for 5 minutes or so. The dvd includes several extra features and any fan of the first film will more than likely enjoy this one too. Good film for a boring afternoon or to see with a group of friends."
positive,"Great Classic Story: Its amazing to get many classic stories for free and getting them through amazon and reading them on your kindle is not only easy, its easy to read and the way things are going to go. The story was classic and I highly suggest downloading as many of the free classics as possible."
positive,"Excellent insight into Jewish lifestyle for any Christian: I have purchased 20 of these books and given them to friends. The search for Christians to reach out and understand their Jewish roots is vital for the correction or misapplication of some of our beliefs. This book points toward a more powerful and insightful lifestyle, and brings understanding to a much needed area."
positive,"Great Movie and Great Amazon Experience: I buy all my movies on Amazon. This Harry Potter didn't disappoint. A really enjoyable movie, and the best part of it is that with Amazon buying the movies I want is easy and efficient."
positive,Funny and wonderful: I totally loved this book. I was hooked all the way through. I loved the two main characters. Jennifer Crusie's books have all been wonderful so far..and I will continue to look forward to the others.
positive,"Adrenaline Rush of a movie!: This movie is so action packed and every time you turn around there is something else happening that if you took your eyes away you would miss it! Plus, it helps that Vin Diesel is in it, since he is soooo HOT!! But even if he wasn't in it, it would be an extremely good movie! I love all of the action scenes and the characters! Also, all of the high tech gadgets that are in the movie help out too!This DVD has an awesome special feature for the new 2004 GTO coming out this Winter. I love this car and the car that is in this movie helps with the adrenaline rush too!I also love the choice of music!!Good buy for anyone!***Check it out!!***"
positive,"Very colorful: Tizzy lived on Monster Planet. One day a tidal wave came and destroyed her home, but her friends all tried to find her a new one.Despite trying very hard from cave to underwater homes just didn't work for Tizzy until finally they found her just the right place.This is a sweet book teaching children how friends all chip in to help each other. The illustrations are very colorful and the story leaves you smiling.Shirley Johnson"
positive,"Imagine the image of a boot stamping a human face, forever..: Nineteen Eighty Four offers a harrowing glimpse into the totalitarian state. Previous posters are correct that Orwell NEVER intended his novel to be an indictment against Communism. After all, Orwell himself fought against the Franco Regime during the Spanish Civil War - on the side of the Republicans AND Socialists. I would like to respond to a certain (British) poster thus: The individual reads and relates his interpretation of a novel/philosophy to the modern situation in which he/she finds him/herself. This would inevitably lead some to relate Nineteen Eight Four to a modern totalitarian society based upon the personality cult, e.g., North Korea (Kim jong Il, Our Dear Leader)."
positive,"Bundle of Joy: Our one-week-old baby loves his SwaddleMe. It quiets him instantly and keeps his feet and hands warm. It also makes him easier to carry. Best of all, he looks like a little pea pod."
negative,"Deceptive: I have used the actual DAP product with my dogs quite successfully. This was NOT a DAP product but a name I have never heard of. No wonder the price was so good, you get what you pay for. Shame on this seller!"
positive,"A day without rain vs Amarantine.: I am a bit disappointed about this cd. I was very anxious because i wanted to listen to a new enya's cd. Today, i listened to it and i discovered that something is missing.I dont know what is it, but it misses. Maybe, there are no the rythms of some well known songs as Orinoco Flows or Anywhere is.I loved some songs as ""Amarantine"", ""Less a pearl"" (Excuse me if i dont remember very well the songs.),and other.But if i had to choose between ""A day without rain"" and ""Amarantine"", i would prefer the first one."
negative,"Not the 2 short album to start with: Suprised with all the positive reviews for this album, since this is one of Too Short's weaker albums. There are a few enjoyable tracks here, but nothing to write home about. ""Shorty the Pimp"" and ""Get in where you fit in"" are so much stronger, that this I wouldnt bother with this one."
positive,"Can not wait: Just made my order today on Amazon for the blu ray.Have this on vcd, dvd, vhs and I also think it was on betamax.Not sure if anyone can put me right here, but I thought I may have seen this movie in a cinema in the UK on what they then called the wide screen.Some cinemas in the UK at that time would adertise the show as a wide screen production and I remember the curtains would open really wide as if they surrounded the cinema.Aftet that is was wow for a great experiance if like me you liked to view from what we called the gods, the upper circle.Anyway looking forward after great reviews to see it on my blu ray system.I will come back and review my total experiance."
positive,"Before The Crow, He was a Cop: This film here was the first Brandon Lee American movie. He had done some limited TV spots and a film in Hong Kong prior to Showdown in Little Tokyo though. For a low-budget film, it's sure to keep both Lee and Lundgren fans enthralled. The fight scenes are well choreographed, and the banter between Lee and Lundgren adds some humor as well. Watching Lee's budding talent, it makes you wonder what would have been had he not died on the set of The Crow. Don't expect the quality of The Crow here, but Showdown in Little Tokyo is definitely worth picking up. It would have been nice if the DVD was offered in widescreen, and if some extras had been thrown in, but the film alone is worth the price of admission."
negative,"Too much hype: Well, how should I say this? It reads like a book written by a 16 year old. There was much hype when this was published and I only read this book very recently. I completely agree with the previous reviewer. Nothing original, no character development, not much of a story. It is mind boggling how this book became #1 Bestseller. Good marketing, I guess. It is basically Star Wars during the time of the Lord of the Rings. Magic instead of the Force and Brom for Obi-Wan. Throw in the dragon-rider mindlink by McCaffery, you have Eragorn."
positive,EASY READ: If you want to kick back and relax this is a good book for it. A good fun read lots of sexual fustration an alpha male a simpering female. What more could you want from Diana Palmer.
positive,"Not the old one, but in brand new condition: The only reason I marked this down was because the description was that it was a 1960's copy that was worn and beat up a little. When I buy used hardback I prefer that. Instead I received a brand new reprint. Still it is an excellent buy. It is that same edition, just minus the wear and tear. Weird thing to complain about I know, but still would've liked it slightly more ""loved"" Get this book now, after the movie trilogy comes out evryone is gonna jack the prices on this. Bought this to read to my kids."
positive,It's a new kind of Mario and I LOVE it.: You need to view this like it was a new kind of Super Mario Brother's set and story. Like a More Modern Day Mario. I loved the sets and actors. And the script was a typical rescue the lady that didn't know she was a princes. Just put your nerdiness to the side and view it as a new kind of Mario and you will enjoy it.
positive,Best Tweezer I have owned: It grabs hair better than any tweezer I have ever used. The mini is fine for me but it is small so you may want to get the regular size.
negative,sound quality ??????: the songs are good tunes but the sound quality is not very good. on some tunes you can hardly hear the guitar that is muffled by the bass.in fact the entire cd sounds muffled. i would go with raunch & roll before this one
negative,"Rusted!: We used this several times over the course of four weeks- and then I noticed that the inside had rusted!! We always wash it right away and let it air dry- which I don't think is expecting too much- but apparently we should have been patting it down!? I've never had a cheese grated rust on me before, so this was a big disappointment. Buying a new one right now- total waste of money."
negative,"Title should be Washington, D.C.: I bought this book because it was ostensibly about Hollywood during the golden days of the silent movies. I found the beginning of the book so tedious I actually stopped reading it-- starting over again a few months later. After at least one hundred boring pages introducing endless Washington characters (trying to sort out their relationships to each other is mind numbing), you finally get a glimpse of Hollywood. The book then goes back and forth, with the majority of ""action"" (a term I use very loosely) taking place in the east. I enjoyed the last fifty pages or so. If you like Gore Vidal, okay read it. But if you are interested in old Hollywood--I suggest you skip this book and find something else."
positive,"A great alternative perspective: Particularly appropriate for these times (even many decades after it was written), Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson offers an alternative to the traditional Keynesian economic theory of the 20th Century. This book is a fairly easy read for non-economists and, though a bit repetitive towards the end, quite enlightening. I'd recommend this book strongly for any student of macro economics or anyone curious in what is happening to the global economy."
negative,"So-So Kid's Fodder....: I was disappointed with this show, especially the ending. There didn't seem to be a point to the story. Sure, Babe was cute, and it is kind of sweet to see the animals talk, but I don't think this movie would hold much interest to those over 10. If you want a really fantastic pig movie, watch Charlotte's Web."
positive,"America The Beautiful: Not being much of a jazz fan at the time, in the late 80's I was coerced into seeing a Pat Metheny concert and left the show quite impressed. Since then, I've collected a number of his albums and I listen to them quite regularly. Along with Travels and New Chataqua, this is one of my favorites."
positive,"American Standard Version (1901): This is the most literal translation of the Holy Bible in existence. If one wants to read the Scriptures in the English form closest to the original manuscripts ... this is the it. And by the way, it is NOT out-of-print. Star Bible began republishing the ASV as of January 2000. It is available in both hardback and leatherbound ... and includes both the Old and New Testaments."
positive,"Music for the 21st Century: This is one fantastic CD.The combination of musicians that are on this CD take the music to another place. I am a big Miles Davis fan and first heard of Jason Miles when I got TuTu many years ago.On this Cd he has managed to create a musical universe that I have not heard on a CD for quite sometime. It's funky,lush,melodic,hard hitting and has the musical integrity that many Cds that try to be commercial don't have.I played this for my 17 year old son and he just loved it.The music has the ability to speak to alot of different audiences and age groups.I love the track Voices on The Corner. It's music that I've never heard before.I agree with the reviewer here who can't figure out why Jason Miles isn't a household name. Hopefully this CD will change that"
positive,"A Must for Kate & Leopold fans: The music on this cd is a lot like the movie...different, but with a great romantic edge to it. The only thing is that to enjoy it, you need to like music with no words that can put a picture in your mind...this does exactly that. If you loved the movie, I would DEFINATELY recomend this cd."
positive,"Inspiring. The book was a wake up call for me.: It may sound corny to some but the people described in this book represented the values of the majority in their time. It's only because of them and hundreds of thousands like them in the U.S and other countries, that Americans enjoy the riches and freedoms that we take for granted today. The book could have been large enough to fill up a good size library. However, Tom Brokaw did an excellent job of choosing a good cross-section of the country. I was impressed with his own insights to that time and got the feeling that his words were from the heart. As the son of a waist gunner on B-17's and POW who never spoke of the War until his last few years, I whole heartedly agree with the title of this book."
negative,"Did not meet expectations, over priced: I found this book to be a very over priced item. It is not even close to being worth $70.00. My son also wanted ""Jedi vs Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force from another Amazon vendor & at $17....this was a much better buy."
positive,"uncle silas: This book is great for anyone who is a fan of Gothic, Victorian, or mystery novels. All of these genres come into play for an interesting story. The tone is dark, and the descriptions of the landscape help give the book a ""spooky"" feel. There is also an interesting tie in with the Swedenbourgs, which was informative, as well. I loved this book, and it's a shame that Sheridan Le Fanu isn't more widely read."
positive,Thrilled! And Warm!: I bought this to help heat a bath off my master bedroom. It works like a charm I run it for twenty minutes prior to hopping into the shower and no more shivering!
negative,"Trite Fantasy and Poor Writing: I thought this story was going to be somewhat promising since the sales rank--but IT DEFINITELY WAS ALL HYPE. I tried my hardest to like it but the poor chracters and ""cookie cutter"" story time and again defeated that. I've never seen a fantasy story so unabashadly rip Tolkien--watch Fellowship the movie (or read the book) and you have the plot.One feels that he was inspired to change the names and write his 'own' story. Inexcusable and pathetic! The more you praise this worthless tripe folks the more of this is what your going to get. I know it's tough people but there ARE good fantasy books out there (and certainly better writers) so show a little discretion and take a stand for quality. It's CERTAINLY not here.Recommended for people without any taste in fantasy or like it predictable and boring."
negative,"Step into readers' shoes.: The best recommendation to the writers of textbooks is ""Step into reader's shoes."" Writer is an expert of the subject. He knows the subject very well. Readers are not. Readers need enough guide to follow what is written in the book. This book often jumps into a conclusion without enough intermediate steps. Equations come out of blue. I was perplexed by that the writing is sparse and crude. Thus I stopped reading this book and returned."
positive,"Yuki: It's easy to use. It's easy to clean up. Functions are simple to understand. I haven't had it for long, so, I don't know anything about it's durability yet."
negative,"Don't buy this one!: Skip this one, hard to get the water pressure right so the bells will go around. The bells are always hanging up on the cord.The center bells are not coated like the bowl and they look bad after a while. The bowl gets white water line that looks ugly.For the money I would pass!!!!!"
positive,"C Murder--almost literally: Well.With news that C-Murder tried to kill a man at a club recently (August '01), I thought Id review the CD. Trapped in Crime is probably C-Murder's second best CD. It's better than Bossalinie but not quite as good as Life or Death. The CD features the usual suspects like Master P, Silkk, Snoop Dogg, Krazy, Magic, so you know theyll be bringing the heat. The CD seems to have more ballads or whatever you wanna call them, compared to other No Limit/C-Murder CDs. Overall though its a good album worth buying if you like No Limit."
negative,"Frogtown vs. Maniac Cop and the Incredible Hulk!: The infamous Sam Hell returns, only this time, instead of out-of-work wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper, the film's star is played by B-movie hero, the living punchline, Robert Z'Dar! You may remember him as the title role of the three MANIAC COP flix or as the villain of TANGO & CASH... actually, I think it best that none of us be remined of TANGO & CASH, so let's forget I said anything. This time, Sam and his fellow Texas Rocket Rangers must go back to Frogtown and free there co-worker Lou Ferrigno, known best for his work as the title role in the ""Incredible Hulk"" TV series! Here he is once again, in green body paint as Sam and friends must save him from the newly roboticized Cammander Toadie and his hopping minions. Will they suceed? Who cares, I came to see the frogs baby!"
negative,"doesn't work in the cold: So I've been using the curt switch ball with my f150 for the past month or so. I regularly tow a few different trailers and need to switch between the 2"" and 2 5/16"" ball. I got this so I wouldn't have to carry 2 different ball mounts around in my truck, and it fulfilled that purpose. Heres a big problem I've run into though. When it gets cold, due to thermal contraction or something, it becomes really difficult if not impossible to swap the balls out. At first I thought it was rust forming either on the stem or the balls, but I tried the 1 7/8"" ball which I have never used and it wouldn't go on either. I left it in my house overnight and now I can slide all of the balls on and off no problem. Haven't found a good solution to this yet. Thinking about trying the reese switch ball system to see if that works better"
negative,"Missing Critical Text!: This version is missing text. As others have noted, whenever there is a quote from a newspaper article in the story, the text is missing. The entire legend of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" which does much to set the supernatural tone of the story, is missing! I'm only in Chapter 4 and have counted 3 missing passages already."
positive,"Love the movie but refuse to buy a flawed DVD: I have been waiting for this movie to be released (in Australia) for ages now, and I have been thinking about buying this DVD version, but I have decided to register a protest vote against Disney and the tactics they appear to be using to make the world a sanitised artificial place by censoring anything that does not agree with their world view.It was pointed out on a local TV show that Disney spent millions on their lifelike CGI dinosaurs and yet they have no 'waste removal organs'. How lifelike is that?If enough people refuse to buy their products (especially the well informed DVD buying market), then we may be able to force them to release more complete versions of their old classics. Register a protest vote today!"
positive,"Playdough fun!: This was purchased as a Holiday gift for our 2 1/2 year old. She is very artistic in nature, as are my other two older children (ages 9 & 11) and they all play together when this gets whipped out. It's great for when I need a little time to do some sewing to keep the kids busy for awhile.Sometimes mom gets in on the creative action as well, and then we end up playing for long times, strengthening our bonds.Much better than sitting in front of the TV or computer.The only subject I would mention that could use a little improvement is maybe an idea sheet, like a how to, to give the kids a jumping point on creativity with what is included in this package."
positive,"Love it: I have been using a candle warmer for about 5 years and it finally gave out. Didn't really keep my coffee hot but was ok. This coffee warmer is hotter than the candle warmer but not hot enough to burn. Keeps my coffee at the desired temp and keeps me happy. I love it. Bought 3 so I could have one in the bedroom, one in the den and one in the living room. :) If you want to keep your coffee warm then this is what you need."
positive,"From regional coverages and insights to financial concerns, nothing is omitted: Why the need for a specialized title on France when so many general travel books exist for the country? Because it's quite a different matter living in France as opposed to visiting it: there are concerns ranging from legalities and visas, work, and housing to cultural insights necessary to live alongside the French. In Living Abroad In France, author Terry Link begins with the dream and offers a step-by-step progression to achieving its reality, with chapters surveying all aspects of living in France. From regional coverages and insights to financial concerns, nothing is omitted."
positive,"Farberware Fan two: I purchased this pan to supplement the 10 piece classic collection. I didn't realize the pan was so big. I have a glass cooktop and the pan is much bigger than the biggest burner. This isn't a problem if what I am cooking has a sauce (e.g. goulash or chicken&dumpings), however, if I am frying something I need to keep to the center of the pan. Still, I have learned how to make use of the different heat zones and like using this pan."
positive,"Great product, price & delivery: Really like using landscape plastic versus the landscape fabric sold in home improvement stores. The plastic does a much better job of killing the weeds below while preventing new weeds- the fabric sold in stores is more expensive and the root system of weeds actually thrive along the material. 4MIL black plastic is my favorite to use with stones especially. Product well priced, good quality, great shipping and made in the USA."
negative,"What happened here?: Hey--the guy from Belle and Sabistian is making an album influenced by electronic music. A fantastic next step? The natural evolution of a great artist?Not even close. There is not one interesting track on this album. It is flavorless ear candy that doesn't even stay in your head while the album is playing. Staurt David--with Belle and Sabastian--did two of the most beautful and memorable albums in my collection. He could have taken that band a step further, mixing their wonderful tunes with his eletronic experiments. Why is he wasting his obviously giant talent doing projects as boring and void of subtance and as Geometrid?If you like B&S--DON'T BUY THIS!"
negative,Pretty thin stuff: The Laurel and Hardy bits are slightly amusing - the rest of the film is paper thin. Try to catch it on Turner Classic Movies. It's not really much of a film.
positive,Easy Coffee System: I like the fact of how easy it is to make a cup of coffee every morning. I do not like the fact of how expensive Keurig coffee is - I know there are other options to use your own coffee - so I'll be looking into that.
negative,"Just a marketing gag: The authors praise the real options approach as t h e new and effective method to decide on uncertain investments. When it comes to elaborate on methods and techniques, however, they fall short of explanations and try to get away just with a presentation of final results. It seems to be no more than a marketing gag. If you want to waste your money than buy the book."
negative,"Sunflower Seed Particulates: I have a case of 8.5 ounce packages sent to me every-other month.Normally, I am quite satisfied with what I receive.So far every package in this last order - I just opened package #7 out of 12- is consistantly sunflower seeed dust. I must have received the packages that were filled with the last of the stuff in the bottom of the bin at the factory.The problem is that because I received one case from one specific packaging period at the factory - they are ALL like that. If I had bought them at a retail store one or two at a time, I probably would have only gotten one or two out of 12 bags of this quality.YUK!"
negative,Don't bother!!: Doesn't seem to do anything. Total waste of money. Wish I could get my money back! Have found there is something better than this.
negative,"Don't waste your time: This book was highly recommended to me but turned out to be a major disappointment. The characters were one dimensional, the mystery was less than compelling and the writing was sub-par. The author kept interrupting the flow of the mystery with these supposedly humorous scenes with some bumbling co-consipirators. It wasn't funny, it wasn't mysterious, it was just bad."
negative,"worked great, but burned out: This worked great until it suddenly started blowing less air and a burning smell came from it and really irritated my lungs for a few minutes. I have never had lung problems. I bought a second one and the same thing happened."
positive,"Amazing: I personally thought that the originality of the plot was what made the book interesting for me. Never before had I read a book about the banning of books and using ""firemen"" to get rid of them. At times there were some lulls and some confusing parts, but overall Bradbury's unique style is what made the book worthwhile for me to read. I believe that Montag was at times a flat character that could use a little spice, but his growth throughout the novel seemed to counteract the deterioration within his own surrounding society. To think that one day our own society could be like Montag's; burning books and stifling creativity; is absolutely frightening to me and this book does not try to supress that notion. It actually amplifies it, but it can be used as a reference for our future generations so they would never reach that low point that Montag's society reached."
negative,not what i expected i guess: i got this for my dad caus he loves louis l'amour and the sacketts but it was like the tv version where it would act like it was going to comercial then come back on ? i was frustrated ! ...i can not get to mad cause i never read to see if it was edited for tv or something i dont know ?
positive,Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian: I saw this movie in the theater and wanted it for my iPad to see over and over again. Amazon is the best way to go to purchase online videos. I highly recommend this movie and appreciate Amazon.
positive,Excellent product and easy to install!: This was so easy to install and it works great. I higly recommend it.
positive,A must read for public speaking: Excellent book. This book has been in print for so many years and has tremendous credibility. Reads like a textbook. A person in business who communicates must read this book. I highly recommend.
positive,"Great book,great storys which are very funny: From listening to Italian,French and German records while in the bathroom or 7 children getting Whooping cough on the train across the country,you can always count on the Gilbreths for laughs! I love this book for alot of reasons one of them is I love the dad he is the best! When he wants to have 12 children he does! Which is what makes the humor of this book so funny!!"
positive,"good, cheap product: This product is about half the price of that offered from apple. It does not have a charge light, but for me it isn't worth the price. Product charges the battery, which is all I am looking for."
positive,"Realistic and Disturbing: A movie that feels like a documentary, as we follow around several less than motivated teens. Sex, violence, apathy - these are kids who have no idea of anything that doesn't affect them. Fine movie that really gets under the skin of these bored kids. Bare bones DVD, but that doesn't really matter with a movie this worth watching. Does have some very harsh language and some sexual situations that make you squirm, but never played for voyuerism. I recommend watching with the subtitles, as the slang and slurring can be a little hard to understand."
positive,excellent: Green fingerstwo very big thumbs up for this perfect movie. It is very funny and ok for kids even though its rated r. it has a 5 second scene of nudity in a porno magazine but otherwise its not even bad. If you want a well done movie with funny acting this is your movie. Prisoners decide to try gardening and they go into this competition. ... It's got romance too. People that hate British movies will hate this. It is a total British film. It is fun and cool otherwise.
positive,Best magnet mount on the market!!!: This is the second Cobra HG A2000 that I Purchased in the last 6 monthssimply because the first HG A2000 was so easy to Tune and works terrific!I needed this for our second vehicle that my wife drives.I highly recommend this to any serious CB'er!!
positive,Absolutley great for the kids!: My son loves to listen to the tape. It had wonderful songs and it really involves the kids. I must admit that I too love to listen.
negative,"NOT what described: I bought this toy for my 1 year old. When I first got the package, I noticed that the plastic covering was torn. This should have been my first clue. The product was NOT what the picture is. Infact, it's a cheaper one that costs 10$ less. I got the Mega 2 play land. I found it at Toys R US for 47$. The balls that were supposed to come with the play set were opened and had hair on them. The set is flimsy, attaches cheaply, and falls over very easily. Without the addition of the balls, I set it up and my 1 year old loved it. I determined that I was going to get a different brand all together because I was unhappy with the order. The balls, besides used already, were very cheap and squished easily. Overall this product sucks. I'm sending it back tomorrow ( i got it today). I will be ordering a different brand all together from Toys R Us. The tunnels don't even connect right...there are big holes where they attach. disappointed....."
