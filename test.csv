label,review
negative,"Howlingly Horrible: This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I've seen in recent memory.I watched this because there is a 14 year old in the house who is understandably amused by girls in their early twenties dancing on top of a bar....and is willing to watch a non-plot for a half-hour between those scenes. Short of a pubescent male, I have to think that anyone who enjoyed this movie is either miguided (hopefully) or an idiot.If this is really what a person looks for in a film, let me recommend saving your money and watching nearly any television sit-com....they're just as bad and it won't cost you four bucks a pop. Take that extra four bucks and donate it to the library. That way, people who are dragging the human race intellectually down to such a depth can at least offset the damage they do by hopefully lifting someone else up."
positive,"Shocking for its time: This movie about a bunch of white gangsters is probably the only one that was out in the 70's. Stanley Kubrick was well known after writing this masterpiece. I can't compare this movie to any other because there are no movies about futuristic gangsters. Its just amazing. A story about a boy who has a violent head and still appreciates the art of music like mozart and beethoven. Then getting caught commiting a crime, going to jail and then totally turning from evil to good... then he goes through another process again from going from good to evil. Its very interesting."
positive,"Bowie keeps on getting better and better: David Bowie's Hours is an incredible album. It is Bowie as ""naked"" as we have seen him. Hours is a strong collection of personal songs that captivate the listener. David Bowie has the remarkable talent of keeping his work fresh and inspiring. Hours is Bowie's ""Songs of Faith and Devotion."" Bowie takes a deep breath..and exhales perfection. Incredible."
positive,"Meryl Streep is Great: Great movie for it's time. Well put together. Of course, you throw in Gene Hackman and Shirley Maclaine and you have pure greatness."
negative,"Not what I expected: I purchased this for my granddaughter, we love reading together. The print was WAY to small and no way to make it bigger."
positive,"Fun Toy For Traveling: This is a really fun toy for kids when traveling. Both of my kids (10 & 13) had fun playing with it, and I recommended it to my parents who got one as well. It will keep kids amused for a good long time, and it makes them really think about a certain object. Good fun!"
negative,Don't Bother: Bought 1 Item and got some cheap junk..... item was completely different from what was pictured.... picture quality was like garbage!!!!!
positive,Our Baby loves this toy: This works wonders. We play it for her when she goes to sleep and if she wakes up she turns it on herself and falls back to sleep after a short time. This is much better than an over the head mobil.
positive,"Innovative design, bad printing: The shirt is 100% cotton and fits perfectly.The collar is a little too high, but it's just part of it's design, and not really a problem.The idea for the printing is quite nice and very well done. Having a ""broken image"" in a shirt can be quite entertaining among friends.But there's one letdown: the quality of the printing isn't as high as it could be. It's quite thick and brakes apart in little pieces. That can't be seen from a distance, but if you get upclose with an observing person, (s)he will notice it.Still, 4 out of 5 stars, because the idea is excellent."
negative,"One of the top ten worst movies ever!!!: I haven't even bought the dvd, but I have seen the movie, and I felt a need to write this after reading some of the other reviews. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It ranks right up there with that Godzilla movie from a couple of years ago, which was so bad that it actually angered me. This movie was just plain embarrassing. Either the other reviewers are having a good old laugh with their comments, or they're genuinely easy to please."
positive,"Great Book: This book taught me a lot about plays and how they're written, and the different and various elements that are required to make good and well-written plays. I'd recommend this book for anyone who wants a good read!"
negative,"Sandisk 8 gig black: Bought two units and after a few months one stopped working. Could get no info from the unit it was dead. Contacted Sandisk and ask for quick replacement. Offered to prepay to secure item would be shipped quick. Was told I did not need this. Item was bad and would be replaced with in a few days. After waiting a full month, I had to phone the Co on Ca. Manager told me the order had not been shipped and this some times happens. Had phoned the supply house in another state and player would be shipped.Worse customer support I have seen. Would not buy another unit from this Co. Manager I talked with sounded like a brain dead stoner. Might be why orders get lost.Order with caution and if you require replacement, prepare to follow up daily."
positive,"Tragic: Beautifully descriptive, tragic story. Little pearl was the most captivating character in my opinion. Good read, would recommend to Jane Austen fans."
positive,"Extremely Informative: From the very first chapter, the author made it seem like he was speaking directly to me. This book is definitely for someone who is interested in Costume Design and wants to know absolutely everything about it, in detail (not for someone already in the field and familiar with how it works). It's not just a book that I'll read and then retire to my bookshelf. As I continue to aspire to be a costume disigner, this book will stay by my side for a long time. The ideas he gives you in the first chaper on how to break down the script is easy to learn, with practice. I urdge anyone who is interested in this field to buy this book first."
negative,Terrible Book!: Author doesn't believe in any biological interventions and feels you should just accept you kid's disability and get on with it. Needs to spell check his work also.
positive,"Beautiful movie on DVD: I have seen the Court Jester many many times, and I love the restored color on this DVD. The music and story is still wonderful -- the vessel with the pestel has the brew that is true."
negative,"take a different class: After a semester using the text i have come to the conclusion that the authors, Brehm, Kassin, and Fein, leave more questions then answers and that their sub-par sense of humor is more then just a waste of money. After reading certain sections i get the feeling that the authors do not clearly understand the issue at hand, but rather throw 15 different research studies at the topic covering their uncertainty and topping it off with a dire attempt at a joke leaving the reader completely ambiguous."
positive,"Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it: If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper."
negative,"THIS WON'T MAKE YOU HAPPY: There are bad movies, and there are badder movies. And then there are simply TERRIBLE movies. This is one of them, an indie that can only serve to prove that MOST (not all, now) indies are movies made by intellectuals who think they have something important or 'artsy' to say, but manage to say nothing. This abominable film is one of the worst movies I've ever suffered through. A plot that makes no sense whatsoever with performances that are stifling and unbelievable, and no semblance of coherency at all. David Arquette should start being a stay at home husband for Courteney, and Ally Sheedy needs to retire. As for Clarence Williams III, he should stay in retirement and watch THE MOD SQUAD or something more productive. Nothing saves this awful mess."
positive,The Flying Sorcerers: As the title indicates - expect many puns and sci-fi references in this book. Quite enjoyable as a bit of light reading to while away a bit of time.
positive,"Great book, a must read: If you have any interest in American history, Nantucket whaling, or a great sea story....then you must read this book. This true story is what Moby Dick was based upon."
positive,"good: this book seemed to take awhile to get to me but it still came within the specified time frame so, all's well I guess, and the condition of the book was quite acceptable."
positive,"Uplifting and thrilling to listen to: I like this CD more all the time. The best song is ""Measure of a Man"", so touching and beautiful. I also like ""The Way"", and eagerly await the video of this. Clay's voice is beautiful throughout the album, and he shows facets of his personality that I never knew were there. I appreciate the fact that 3very song is a new song, and that there are no ""covers"" like in Ruben's debut (which I hated!)"
negative,Netgear let this one before they finished desiging the unit.: I purchased this high speed router for a dedicated satellite internet connection. The unit provides one SSL outbound connection which is almost useless. The unit will not autosense the modem connection speed either 10 or 100 Mbps. The manufactures solution is to put an ethernet hub between the router and the ethernet modem. (what kind of a fix is that) Not what I would consider top of the line from Netgear. I would not recommend or sell one of these to any of my other customers.
positive,"Dads! Buy a Few and Sleep Better: I'm a father of two, one is currently swaddled in this. She sleeps in this. No crying! Buy a few as your wife will want to wash it when the infant spits, throws up, etc.."
positive,"Excellent insight: As a long-time Christian, I had to admit that my disciplines were somewhat haphazard. This book is not advocating legalism but encourages discipline while offering insight as to why it is important in order to live a rewarding God-pleasing Christian life. Put into practice, it will cause you to constructively strengthen your Christian walk."
negative,"Don't know much about history: This movie is about as historically accurate as your basic Renfest, complete with Eighties hair, Halloween costumes, and anachronistic dialogue and philosophies. A man taking his raped fiancee back in sixteenth-century Italy? Are you kidding?The dialogue is awful, the script is worse, and the cast is to be pitied. The costumer designer should be shot. Verhoeven should just switch over to porn or maybe create a new genre: the action movie with actual porn, because that's apparently waht he wants. For all that, us ladies are stuck seeing yet another naked female body, while the male goodies get treated like sacred relics that must be kept shrouded in mystery.I can hardly wait till my historian buddy sees this."
negative,"Not as advertised, Missing 5.1 sound only 2 channel audio: This disc is not Anamorphic widescreen and it is missing DD 5.1 sound, it has only French 2 channel and English two channel sound.This disc , not the Movie is a major disappointment.I thought they were finally releasing this movie in an Anamorphic widescreen format."
negative,"Sedaris is better than this.: I am unequivocally a Sedaris fan, but this book left me wondering if he really has much material left that worthy of being published. The strength of his first 2 or 3 books certainly earned him notoriety and a reputation for tongue-in-cheek prose, but the stories in ""Corduroy"" were simply dull and boring.I certainly can't recommend this book. Get ""Me Talk Pretty.."" or ""Naked""."
positive,"New and Different: I usually dont like this kind of music, but the very first time I heard 'All the Things She Said' on the radio I wanted to know who sang it. But I didnt find out until I saw the music video. Its not your typical teen cheesy type of music. True, it is somewhat pop-sounding, but its original. The album is wonderful. Their voices are beautiful. You just have to be in the mood to accept something new, or at least give it a chance. Its a great deal for the price, as well. Its a great CD, its enhanced and it doesnt cost much. So you should stop being cheap and buy it ;)"
positive,"Excellent Organic Soybeans!: I've been trying different brand of soybeans for home-made soymilk. This is the best one I've found so far and plan to stay with it for long. Soybeans look actually smaller than other brands, after soaking overnight, the beans are very easy to be processed. Produced soymilk tastes much better and while cooking, it has some natural aroma smell. Highly recommended for anybody looking for THAT RIGHT SOYBEANS for homemade soymilk!"
negative,"13 year old toy enthusiast: I thought this kitchen would be like the one I used to have. The one that I had had a stocked full fridge, a dishwasher, a big oven and real food. I had real eggs that cracked open and there was an egg inside. But I was wrong and I do not reccomend this kitchen because the fridge has no food in it and the one skillet that comes with it covers almost three burners and you have nothing to cook in the skillet and there is hardly any room to move around and the whole kitchen falls over if you put the toaster where it is supposed to be."
negative,"Disappointed in Scotts: This product is new and replaced one that also leaked, but the old one only dripped and I managed to hot glue spots where it dripped.This one LEAKS in several places.It is unusable.I emailed Scotts and they defended the product and said they had very few complaints.I suggested they read these reviews.I guess they want us to buy the premixed products which apparently have a much higher profit margin.Anyone find something to replace this product?"
negative,"Not a fan of Continuum: I was disappointed.My wife, who is the big stargate fan, was also. She watched it a second time and said she was glad she bought it ... after being really disappointed on the first viewing.If this were the only stargate show, I would not have any desire to watch another.My wife and I had settled down to watch good entertainment and I really was not at all happy with what I saw. It seemed confusing to me how they were pulling elements from different times and trying to put them under a single time.Anyway, glad to give my opinion for what it is worth.Save your money for something that is worth watching."
positive,"megaland pop-up: excellent product!! my grand sons are playing with it every chance they have. the one your-olds can be distructive, but this product has so far held its own with them. i love the way it can be folded and carried to the play area or the pool. the best thing i purchased for them in a long time.michael"
negative,"WHY THE SUCH GOOD REVIEWS: This movie [...] one of the damn dumbest movies ive seen in a long time, As if the first one wasnt bad enough, just when i though this one would be somewhat better because there was no chance of it being worst then the first. I was wrong again. I dont see how you people can enjoy something so damn dumb. Then again im sure more then the majority of you are computer nerds anyway that get off on this dumb ass super hero movies....[...]"
positive,"A classic: For my money, the best of the Middle Earth books. Have to read it in Junior High but loved it. The man launched an entire genre of literature."
positive,"Good flick: Yes i'm a guy and yes i enjoy chic flicks from time to time,so sue me.This is a good film from Diane Lane(best known for her great performance in Unfaithful)which was also the first flim i recall her having a main staring role.I won't get in to deep to the story but she is a recent divorcy,whom feels she can't go on living in San Fransico,so her 2 gay lesbian friends convince her to go on an all gay trip to tuscan(italy).While there she becomes intrigued by a 300 year old italian home,mind you nothing works,and its in pretty sad shape.So she hires contractor's to help her with her project,and all along the way she runs into various men whom you think she'll develop an attraction to and maybe more but it never pan's out.So thats all i'll give for now,watch for yourself.Although it seems a little slow in places it's an entertaining little piece of film none the less."
negative,Did not meet my father's needs.: I bought this for my father who has severe hearing loss and wears 2 hearing aids. It really did not improve his ability to communicate over current phones that he has. Good feature was that it lit up when he received an incoming call. I will probably be looking into a captioning phone for him next.
positive,"The greatest way to discover Maceo Parker: Undoubtedly the greatest way to discover Maceo Parker. This live recorded at Cologne in 1992 bring together Maceo, Fres Wesley, Pee We Elis and more guest (Kim Mazel, Candy Dufler...).http://www.maceo-parker.com/albums.html"
negative,"Where is B Angie B?: ***********BUYER BEWARE************************. If you buy this CD for the song Juicy gotcha crazy Ft. B angie B you will be disappointed. Because she is not on the version that is on this album. And futher more the version on the album has some kind of rock sound with guys singing juicy in the background and the ladies rapping don't even sound like 357. This song and Yeah, Yeah, Yeah were the only reason I bought the CD. Yeah...song is cool it still sounds the same. But this messed up juicy version made me angry. I wish I had knew this before I bought it."
negative,"TOTAL PIECE OF TRASH! JUST SAY NO!: I would like to give this movie no stars but it was not an option. Don't be fooled by the indie reviews and look of this film. It is HORRIBLE! I'm a huge John Waters fan and enjoy camp and ""bad"" movies. Even John Waters would be bored with this one. The director spent too much time on looooong shots and scenes that go nowhere. Repetitive dialogue from the main character also gets annoying. Too bad! The movie could have had great potential but failed at the hands of an un-creative director."
negative,Extreme Disappointment: Don't purchase one of these - their are better options at Amazon.The first one (which was shipped very promptly) refused to accept a charge after a day or so. While Amazon sent a replacement as soon as I reported the problem the second one has now stopped accepting a charge after three weeks.The service (as always) from Amazon has been great but needless to say this particular batch of batteries has some inherent problems so look at the alternative brands available at amazon.
negative,"Lord of the Flies...: I did not enjoy this book, I thought it was over-rated and quite boring. It has no real plot and the story line is a never-ending piece of text which in all honesty, bored me to tears!.I find that William Golding should not have had as much success as he did because the Symbolism is never ending and I can not handle how he symbolises even a scar or a pair of glasses worn by a fat kid.This book can easily be reduced from 225pages to at least 3pages. They are stranded, two boys die and they're rescued! Hooray! (As you can tell I'm being sarcaistic!)."
negative,"Elementary Differential Equations: [..]Let me warn all potential customers that this book is all about quantity of material instead of quality. While the book does cover such advanced topics as Fourier Analysis and intro to Partial Differential Equations, the book lacks sufficient examples about what is being said (a number of sections have no examples at all).I did find the most well-written sections to be the application of second-order differential equations (applied to spring oscillations etc.) However, as far as getting a bang for your buck, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Morris Tennenbaum and Harry Polland's Ordinary Differential Equations Dover edition (cheaper, and MUCH MORE effective. Trust me)."
positive,"A profound look at the logic behind Christianity.: C.S. Lewis explores the common beliefs of all Christian denominations by appealing to his readers logic. Beginning with observations about human nature, he builds a case for the existance of a higher power, that higher power being like the Christian view of God, and how Christianity fulfils the expectations of such a god. He searches into many of the questions that humanity has grappled with for all of time: the existance of God and an explanation of sin and evil, and also discusses the mystery of the Trinity and human redemption through Christ. Any one who reads this book will walk away at least realizing how much time and energy must be devoted to religious questioning."
positive,"The Descent Blu-ray Review: I already have this movie on DVD, but like it so much that I ordered it on Blu-ray too. I am very impressed with the quality of the HD. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an original horror flick! I also continue to be impressed with Amazon's excellent service and quality products."
positive,"Blessing: I'm a certified Nurse Midwife. Carolyn, my wife, is a labor and delivery nurse. We live with our daughter, Hilary, in Chinle, Arizona. Right in the middle of the great Navajo Nation. Dr. Organick's book truly captures the spirit and beauty of our area and the Navajo people. I found that from the moment i picked up this delightful book, i was unable to put it down. We have read quite a few books about our area of the world and especially about the Navajo people, but have found nothing that is as enjoyable or easy to read. We have sent copies to friends and relativies and will continue to do so. This is the best book we've found to give everyone a feel for a great area and a great people."
negative,This book is sales literature for Rational.: There are some good ideas in the book. Overall its sales literature. I should be able to download it from Rational's web site. I don't recommend it unless you have full intentions of buying Rational's developer products.
negative,Terrible book.: To me this story is baloney to begin with but if you believe in miracles you may enjoy it.
negative,"ELI THE KING: I thought that this book was a good book. It was very interesting.I also thought that it had to much swearing in it.sincerely, The King Eli"
positive,"Good Quick Reference: Helps with general care plans on major diseases for nurses. Not exhaustive of all diseases, of course."
positive,"ERB Finally Makes LIBRARY OF AMERICA w/A Princess of Mars!: This Library of American edition of A Princess of Mars is a beautiful book! It's about time Edgar Rice Burroughs, one of the USA's bestselling authors for about 20-25 years starting in 1914, had one of his books published by the Library of America. LOA has also published Tarzan of the Apes.I have the 1st edition of A Princess of Mars, by McClurg, and this Library of America edition is close (but not quite) a fascsimile 1st edition. All five of the original illustrations are present, but they are not on ""coated"" paper like they are in the original 1st edition. The dust jacket is beautiful.I short, if you're looking for a very nice edition of this book, buy this one!Before closing, note that I also give the story itself 5 Stars! And the second and third books of the trilogy, The Gods of Mars and The Warlord of Mars, are equally as good!Read ERB's Barsoom series for a thrill!"
positive,"Catchy: Before I begin I must say that I'm a fan of Idols. However I only watched the final show of the American Idols in which Clay was a contestant, so I really didn't know much about him.Why did I get this cd? Well from what I saw he had potential. And I must admit that I was right. This cd is perfect for a gift for someone who is a fan of Idols. Clay has an amazing voice. Why did I only give it 4 stars? Well it's a good cd and all, but it doesn't have that gold quality. Don't get my wrong, I play this often when in the car but there's not a great variety between all the songs. 'Measure Of A Man' is definitely my favourite!If you're into this light-hearted, catchy music then you'll be right at home here. However if you want something deeper I'd suggest looking elsewhere. I don't regret purchasing this cd."
positive,An ever-moving horse story: Marguerite Henry's King Of The Wind receives newfound embellishment in a deluxe reprint edition illustrated by Wesley Dennis and worthy of gift-giving. The black and white drawings lend character and intimacy to this ever-moving horse story.
negative,"Headphone jack: I got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas. So, I've had it for a month, and the headphone jack went out. I called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty. It'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it. Nothing but hassle with this company. What kind of product goes out within a month?"
negative,"'FAR' from being 'new' and 'original': after all the heart-tugging lyricsm from the O L D ep releases, not to mention FAR, and the awesome but short-lived N E O project... this???What a disappointment.Mediocrity and cheese at it's finest. I would like to believe Jonah is 'better than this'.If this is honesty, Jonah, I'd rather you fake it."
positive,Best ever: I have yet to find a better razor. This is so good that i can't even bother with electric razors and any of the cheap knockoffs
positive,"The Videos Make It Worth It: I am the worlds biggest Daft Punk Fan. Having all thier previous work, even the 'hard to find' stuff, this CD was of no use to me other than for nostalgic purposes... that is until I learned of this edition, which includes a special DVD with all of thier music videos to date. Right there I knew I had to own this gem. Worth the buy for the unique videos, especially Around The World.I do have to point out that the quality of the video could have been better, as I have seen Daft Punk music videos on DVD (like the collection of video from Micheal Gondry) that were higher quality, so I know it isnt the video itself, but none the less its only something a videophile would really notice."
negative,"Noel even admitted its rubbish: Oasis dogged it on this album.... Be Here Now and Dya Know What I Mean are the only 2 songs on here that don't drive you mad. It's still a fun album to own for like a month, but after that it will collect dust. I don't know what it is about Oasis, but their songs just tire very easily, unlike the songs of say, U2. Anyway I'm sure the next album will be great again. Yeah Yeah Yeah."
negative,"You will pay about $10 a month to ""rent"" this...: ...then you will need to buy another one. On my third sold from various sources. They all died like clockwork at around 13-15 months."
positive,"Good adventurous read: I haven't read the Lord of the Rings series and wouldn't consider myself an avid fan, but I thought The Hobbit was very entertaining once it picked up its pace. Although I thought the beginning was a bit slow, the book is full of great adventures and rich imagery. There were times I didn't want to put the book down. I only wish I had the hard cover to enjoy the books and illustrations a bit more (but that's not what you buy a book for anyway). Tolkien is always a genius, so I didn't expect any less."
positive,"THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE!: If you read only one book on witchcraft, this should be the one!One of the reasons ""Power of the Witch"" is such a great book, is that it gives a logical and calm presentation. This book does not preach, but deals with certain truths. It is also well documented. It is downright scientific. It is insightful, analytical, intelligent, and historically accurate.""Power of the Witch"" opened up an entirely new world of understanding, and revealed FACTS. I thought I knew a lot about this topic, until I read this book!Reading ""Power of the Witch"" was an enriching and enlightening experience. Higly recommended!"
negative,"A nasty book: Heart of a Jagaur is about a boy named Balam who lives in a Mayan village close to Chichen Itza. He is 14 years old, and really wants to become a man and live in the bachelor house.I gave this book two stars out of five stars because it was a really gory book that was way too desriptive. It teaches you about the Mayas, but the author really didn't have to describe a person reaching into a jaguar and taking out its heart! (Like it did.) Overall it was a bad book (in my opinion) and I recommend you never read it unless you like gory, descriptive books."
negative,"Useless is right!: The iPaq's been out since June and I happened to be one of the first on hand when CompUsa had it on the shelf so I eagerly snatched it up. I can use the USB at home but I also needed the serial cradles for NT at work. Yet here it is October and the serial port still isn't available! Three months and all I've got is a $500 digital grocery list. And what's with CE ver 3? No close button on the applications! I don't even use it now, what a waste of money. Should've been smart and returned it within 14 days. I still drool over the display of accessories for every other hand held out there..."
positive,A Romp Through Georgian London: This book is of interest to anyone who cares about 18th century England but it also could work well for someone looking for an introduction to those extraordinary days. The struggle to survive has never been more acutely portrayed than in this remarkable and yet true story of a daughter spurned by a famous but cold hearted father. You will laugh and cry with and about Charlotte but you cannot come away from this book without a deep appreciation for just how easy our lives are today.
positive,"Pinocchio Blu-Ray: Fantastic Disney Blu-ray release.It features a timeless cinematic classic, a gorgeous restoration, a stunning video transfer, a remarkable DTS HD 7.1 Master Audio track, and a collection of supplemental material that includes several exclusives. The 3-disc Blu-ray edition of Pinocchio should have a home on every filmfan's shelves."
positive,"A Wonderful Tour DVD: Just want to congratulate Brian on the very special new DVD, with so many great moments. The love and respect of his music by so many fellow artists, along with his fans, and family, is truly wonderful, truly moving, and absolutely life-affirming. As David Leaf says, it is an example of an artist re-claiming his legacy. And with this documentary, it is the re-validation of one of the greatest musical geniuses of our - or any - lifetime. Two words for Brian - LOVE YOU!"
positive,"Citizen of Time: Just wanted to share a little history. I bought this on cassette when it was first released back in 1990. Truly an album for that Journey to another place. Probably my favorite David Arkenstone album!! My favorite track ""Explorers"", this song just gets so big, you really feel like at the end of the song you are going up to Heaven. I have this on CD,Cassette and on Vinyl. Truly a remarkable album!!"
negative,"Rod Stewart And The Faces: In Concert: This DVD of Rod Stewart and The Faces In Concert is a total BOOTLEG. The cover is with Ronnie Lane who was not in the band during the recording of this concert. This DVD is the final concert with Keith Richards. I'm sick and tired of companies putting out concerts with different covers of the same ones you already have. It's like bait and switch. And I am a number one Faces fan and this is a load of BS. And for those looking at the Rod Stewart and the Faces: Live In London, this DVD is the DVD featuring Keith Richards in his final concert, different cover. And honestly, this is the weakest show of the Faces I have ever seen because of Tetsu. You cannot even hear his bass in this DVD. I have a bootleg of this DVD that's a better quality than this one. Please do not put money in the pocket of this company, the only good thing about this is the cover.Yours truly,Number One Faces Freak."
negative,"You Will Like This Book, I Didn't...: You will like this book...IF you watch Lifetime television.IF you consider yourself ""socially conscious"" and are interested in the ""chicana"" cause.IF you read books on ""the female experience""IF you have worn or do wear birkenstock sandals with socks.You will not like this book...IF you enjoy fine literature.IF you have read and enjoyed anything by Nabokov or Joyce.IF you have already suffered through House on Mango Street.IF you don't enjoy encountering paragraphs like the following...""Except it's not me who I want to kill. When the gravity of the planets is just right, it all tilts and upsets the visible balance. And that's when it wants to out from my eyes. That's when I get on the telephone, dangerous as a terrorist. There's nothing to do but let it come."" (Cisneros, Woman Hollering Creek p.83)I apologize if this offends any Cisneros fans, however, I must risk being impolite in order to save people the discomfort of reading this book."
positive,Gaslight: My students loved this classic suspense tale and used the information to write their own screenplays!
positive,"Good: It's a good version of some great works by a wonderful author. There are a few mistakes here and there, but I won't complain too much since it was free."
positive,This tale will astonish you: this has Hulks first apperance in Tales to asonish with the original stories. It also tells ofth first 6 of Hulks own series. It suffers little to the newspaper like paper
positive,"The World Ain't Ready 4 Ray J: This album is one of Ray J's finest works. It's gritty and it's honest. His vocals are REAL. When you're a true artist you understand that making a song is not always about hitting the 'right note"". It's about the feeling behind the lyrics. The world is so obsessed with perfection that they're just not ready for this man. They won't let him grow up. One Wish is a gorgeous track. War Is Over is one of my faves. I love it when Ray and Bran sing together and the overall message is outstanding. He seemed extremely mellow on the track. Anytime is super sexy and sensual. What I Need and Exotic are also GREAT! But when you get to the last track 'Centerview"" it'll blow ya mind. It's so gritty and honest. Sheds some real light on this mans ability to move an audience. Overall the album is worth every penny you spend because it sounds nothing like the regular mindless stuff you hear clogging up the airwaves today."
positive,"Conjurer of Reality and Fantasy: Gompertz's uproarious tale of a Messiah in our midst is original, witty, and yet inducing serious thought. It is at once cynical and pious, down to earth and wholly implausible. With tongue in cheek, Gompertz can be tender and sardonic, mocking and sincere. His dialogue flows naturally, and he obviously knows the ins and outs of TV show business. It should make a good stage or teleplay."
negative,low quality publication - Harper One: I just received the set. I pulled out one book out of the box. It was a piece of junk.Harper One should buy a nice paper cutter. The edge of the books are not cut properly.I'm returning it and never buy Harper One publication.
positive,I love Amazon.: Pampers are great. Pampers from Amazon are better. I ordered in bulk and needed a larger size faster than I thought. Amazon picked up the unopened boxes from my house and credited my card. I then ordered the correct size. Great customer service.
negative,"1.5 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Coupling a dead fish of a romance with a complete anti-climax of a superhero movie, Spider-man 2 fails in almost every conceivable way; put it this way, it's never a good sign when your villain is five times more likable and sympathetic as your superhero."
negative,HD vieo is very good but the music is cheesy.: I bought this to have the HD fireplace scenes along with Christmas music playing in the background when we had guests over for the holidays. The HD video was very nice but I was also expecting a quality arrangement of Christmas music to go with it. What we got was someone playing Christmas tunes on an electronic keyboard. It sounded cheap and cheesy. Fortunately we could turn off the music and just enjoy the fire. If you do not care about the music this is nice at a good price.
negative,"Nothing insightful: I'm always looking for material on comic book artists and how they do their craft, and it's very hard to come by. This dvd had some promise such as Eric Powell ( The Goon ) and Erik Larsen ( The Savage Dragon ), and I expected for them to share their experiences in their career, how they broke in and made a name for themselves, how they go about making an issue of their book etc. You get none of this. Instead you get some artists, most that have never been heard of talking about the allure of comic books. If your like me and your looking for a documentary on comic book artists and how the creative process takes shape to a final product on the shelf, your better off passing this by."
positive,"MAKES YOU THINK: I have watched this movie a couple of times, mainly trying to figure out what it is about, but also because it is a great movie. Yes there is rape, sex, violence, and ""ultraviolence"", but there is obviously deeper meaning to this film, I have yet to figure it out but I suspect that may be just the reason it is a cult favorite-it will stick with you after you watch it and will be talked about for generations to come."
negative,RASH CITY: Left my baby with a diaper rash after 2 days of use. I didn't suspect it was from the diapers at first until a couple weeks later I went to finish using up the package and her rash appeared again. I'll never use pampers again.
negative,"Choppy without characterization: I've read some of Ed Greenwood's other work, with mixed feelings. His Dragonlance book on Huma was pretty good, so I always try him again when I run out of other things to read.Unfortunately, this one has finished me....I'll stay away from Greenwood here on out. This book jumped around so much I couldn't keep things straight. The characters, while they had a chance to help the story, are not developed, and when they are there are inconsistencies. I like the story itself (the only reason I continued reading after 50 pages) but it's not enough for me to recommend this book to anyone."
negative,Wabash 1938: This trilley has been opersted only a few hours and the drive system seems to be slipping already. Not durable and not recommended.
positive,"Excellent in it's brief history of Physics.: This book is a delight to read, if you are curious about Physics. It is especially gratifying from the perspective that it gives a brief history of the way physics has evolved since the field began. It's a great book to use when someone you know wants a more rational explanation of relativity.~Joe K"
negative,"so thin: I liked pamper baby dry size 4. So I tried size 5 and expected it to last long. However, the size 5 one is so much thinner than size 4."
negative,customer service is dead: every person i communicated with was not only rude but were clearly annoyed by my need for help and completely unwilling to assist me . I returned the product that i was charged $103.10 for and was refunded $40.70 . thanks
negative,Worthless.: This stuff doesn't do anything. It's a waste of money. Don't be fooled like I was by the positive reviews.It's too watery and it smells bad. It's just bubbly tea tree oil scented soap.
positive,Kindle version reformatted: This review concerns the Kindle edition. I paid $9.99! I would think at that price the publisher could have somebody edit the e-manuscript! There are numerous paragraph breaks where there should not be as well as some typoes. This detracts from the reading experience! Please fix! (the book itself is a fantasy classic and deserves better treatment than this slipshod editing)Edit 6/7/11 - looks like they reformatted the kindle version to deal with those errors. I don't know for sure if they caught them all because I haven't had a chance to look at it all - even if I had made bookmarks for the errors I wouldn't have been able to check because downloading the new version means the old bookmarks get deleted.
positive,"just what I needed: Good materials , excelllen t work done with these, good box, all colors needed in here, a must have for desingners"
positive,"Better than taking a class!: This video was almost like taking a birthing class. It's almost as if you are in a classroom setting, but in the comfort of your own home. The people are a bit out dated, but so far I've learned a lot and this has been so much more convenient that going to an actual class. I recommend it highly!"
positive,"Outstanding Bed: I've owned 2 beds for over 2 years now and both beds have held up extremely well considering the amount of constant use they've had. One of beds I actually sleep on daily (more comfortable than my regular bed). I had it over 2 years before one of the inner baffels gave way a few weeks ago. I immediatly ordered another bed without hesitation. Very comfortable and super easy to use, with the built in pump, it's a snap to set up and deflate. Love this bed!!"
negative,i agree: i definetly agree with the person below me! It teaches kids to be like these dolls. Thats why i buy my daughter barbies and kellys and strawberry shortcake dolls. (by the way i am an adult not a kid i just dont have an acount :-)] i hope pretty soon the world will figure it out that bratz arent good for kids! mabye preteens and teens but NOT kids under 10. It just killed me too hear in the paper that barbie isnt getting bought any more and mattel has given up!!
positive,"a fun, relaxing read: For centuries the Owens women have been the oddballs. They're the ones people cross the street to avoid...the Owens women are witches. Raised by their two aunts, Sally and Gillian Owens grow up to be polar opposites. Sally is always practical and straight-laced; most concerned with keeping the lives of her two daughters as normal as possible. Gillian, on the other hand, is a free spirit...perhaps a little too free at times.This story follows Sally and Gillian through their trials and tribulations with life, love, and death, and Hoffman's wonderful storytelling makes it, simply, magical! Wonderful twists and turns lurk around every corner of this funny, touching, and at times, dark story...brimming over with themes of compassion, redemption, and inner strength. Playing on every human emotion, Hoffman has struck absolute gold.If you've ever seen the movie,forget it, and pick up this wonderful book!"
positive,"Best DVD I Ever Own: Well, I'm a batman fan. And this is for the one disc set. Heard there were problems with two-disc set but really doesn't concern me because I'm more interested in the movie than the extras. This movie contains a great extra, namely the first scene of The Dark Knight. I actually have to upgrade my dvd software to play that because it was so new and I'm glad I did because the picture was so sharp and clear. Begins cannot even compare. As a movie, you either love it or not. As a product, you cannot go wrong with blu ray. Once you go blu ray you never go back."
negative,"""Are we almost there?"": This yawner reminds me of seemingly endless car trips when I was a kid. Is it really possible that the author of ""Clan"" wrote this turkey? - a Paleolithic soap opera drowning in herbal tea and endless introductions. I'm thankful I checked it out from the library instead of wasting [X]+, but I still paid 30+ days of fines to tough it out to the end. I think I'll celebrate reaching the end by brushing my teeth with a twig. (Did Jondalar use mouthwash? I forget.)"
negative,Story of Mankind: I returned the book because it was only the text. There are NO illustrations. Part of the charm of the book are the illustrations.
positive,"Epic Tale: I have read the Hobbit, and I must say that I have truly enjoyed it very much. It was like reading, or rather listening to a tale from the past, like a myth, or more like a legend. It was beautifully written, and it had all the mastery that is required in an enjoyable book. I recommend everyone to read this book, young and old alike."
positive,"A music fan: I am totally blown away by this album! I haven't heard anything this great in a very long time. Clay has the most beautiful voice in the world, I highly recommend this CD if you enjoy real music."
positive,WOW: I remember this from when I was like 4 years old. I loved it then because of the martial arts and karate. It's dated but it makes me nastalgic
negative,Not good: This game is the worst Nickelodeon game I have ever played. It has horrible graphics and I don't think it portrays any Nickelodeon character at all.
positive,"Wondeful and Warm: This book has been sitting on my bookshelf for a while because I passed it over for other newer books... How sorry I am I waited this long! This book is so good... the stories about the different dogs are heartwarming, and heartwrenching...they are filled with almost any dog immaginable and are a delight to read especially for dog lovers. I can't recommend this book enough..."
positive,"The best pan on the planet...: How many products do you know when you buy it that it will last 30 or 40 years? This is one of them. My mom has had hers for 35 years, I've had mine for 5. It's simply the best pan out there. It cooks evenly, it goes in the dishwasher, the handles stay cool, and you don't have to use plastic spatulas. The only problem that somebody might have is that it is not nonstick. For that reason my wife usually uses a Calphalon nonstick professional pan, even though it can't be cleaned in the dishwasher and you have to treat it carefully. So if you must have nonstick, buy something else. But if you want a large, beatiful, indestructible pan that will last longer than you will, buy this pan!"
positive,"music that moves you: I hadn't watched the American Idol show, but when I heard a song on the radio I had to have the cd. I was not disappointed.It is completely entertaining.Hard to believe he is only beginning his career.His songs seem heartfelt as if he were a seasoned veteran of the music business. I found myself moved and inspired. I highly recommend it."
positive,"Great show, but no need for blu-ray: I bought this show in the blu-ray edition expecting an incredible picture, but there was nothing special about it at all. The extras are nice but not what I buy DVDs for. There's no reason to waste your money buying the blu-ray edition. They didn't have HD technology when this special was produced and they can't change that. Buy the regular DVD and save your money."
negative,"Broken and Ignored: This item was stated as new. The case was broken. The items inside were ok, but this was NOT NEW. I called the company who sold them 3 times and got an answer machine all 3 times. My calls were never returned. I will NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN and dont suggest others do either. Amazon was going to refund, but it was just for a broken case and I didnt want to bother. Just shows that the company selling is NOT a good company and should not be a representative of Amazon.com."
positive,"BEST of the series...unfortunately: This is the first book in the ""earth's children"" series(I think there are six now)It is also far and away the BEST.Great character development and interesting culturalexploration.I loved this book..the rest of the series..not so much"
positive,"Good Deal On Amazon: I have bought about 20 pair of these boots over the past 6 or 7 years. I usually buy them 2 pair at a time and wear one for work and one for good.Even when you buy them at the buy one get one half price in stores the price on here is by far cheaper than anywhere else.They are comfortable, waterproof, last a long time and are light weight."
negative,"et: this cd's pretty unspectacular, the songs sound exactly like the originals but with screaming.the dying degree cover's no exception but it's heavy and fast enough to be fun."
positive,"Shower Head Purifier: This came quickly and seems to work well. I've only had it a few weeks, but my hair is already softer."
negative,"This was an incredibly boring book.: William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation is perhaps the most boring and vexatious book I have ever read. The plain style employed by Bradford is, undoubtably, because of his Puritan backgroud, but that is still no excuse for the tedious and often archaic redition of events. I should think that a high-school text book would give a more lively presentation of life in the ""New Jerusalem"", as Bradford calls it. The antidiluvian vocabulary and monotonous recording of events made this a very difficult book to get through. I would not recommend it to my peers"
positive,"Long movie but really good: It is a little slow at first as they set up the story, but once they get to the actual war it gets really good. The best part for me was seeing all the actors in this movie. So cool to have all this talent in one movie. I recommend."
positive,"Life Lessons: Waiting for the World to End, in essence, is what we all are doing. Nicole Hunter has an amazing book full of intrigue, mystery, and fasination. Having only lived for eighteen years and reading this book I've found I can relate to almost every aspect, especially Ben. His character has helped me grow in ways I didn't even know I could, from a book. Mary and Tom's relationship has made me question those whom I feel close to and respect in their perception of me. The life lessons that were discussed in this book can have a real barring on today's culture and society. It can especially help concentrate on the morals and values of life in the twenty-first century and even life as a whole."
positive,"one of the best CDs of the year: This CD is the best! I purchased it today at a local store, and I have listened to it 4 times already. All the songs on this CD are awesome. Clay has the best voice that I have heard in a long time. I LOVE YOU CLAY!!!!!!"
positive,"This is where ""road-rage"" originates!: If you worry about how much you pay for gas, read this book! END"
positive,great product: had to buy two (one for a gift) would give out more as gift if needed...quick ship too. great product
positive,Making the Invisible Visible by Keith Devlin: What a wonderful book. You just have to read it and then you will understand.
positive,"beautiful dancing: I wasn't sure if I'd be able to relate to Aradia after seeing how professional she always looks in her magazine photos, but having read all the other reviews, I took a chance and bought this dvd. I can only add to the praise by saying, Aradia took her time and thoughtfully planned all the components of this dvd. Might not be suitable for a beginner, but if you are a beginner, get this dvd anyway so you have it when you are ready for it."
positive,"blows you up before you go...: Probably the most best album that will be released this decade. It has great significance in a post-9/11 world. M.I.A. has no qualms about mentioning bombs, guns, terrorists and racism in her songs. Every track stands out, the previous release tracks 'Sunshowers' and 'Galang,' probably some of the best tracks of 2004, are overshadowed by 'Pull Up The People' and 'Bucky Done Gun.'M.I.A. is truly is TuPac of the third-world."
positive,"Pretty Good Weights: The only thing I do not like about these weights is that they are heavy which shows me how weak I really am. They seem to be very good weights. The casting is pretty good....only little defects here and there. The finish is pretty good too. The bar is black and 7' long. The ends on my bar was a little stiff. A little WD-40 and they are spinning fine. Overall, I would buy these again."
positive,"This product is great.: This bed is great. I use it everyday for my little.So far its still inflated and very comfortable.Recommend it for anyone who has a guess or personal use.I especially like the pump, how its connected to the bed andcan store-it inside the bed."
positive,"Nice and Original: High Wizardry is a very nice book. It's well written and displays an unusual sense of magic. Once again, like the other books, it has one main flaw: Duane loses her readers in the plot, through confusing description.However, this book is still very good, and it stirs up emotions in you. The book provides insight on the characters, who once again are amazingly real.It's a nice read before bed."
negative,"SANTANA has overextended himself trying to reach everyone.: Bought the CD, went to the concert, was disappointed at both. There's just not enough Santana in ""All that I am"". Instead, I went back to my own all time favorite ""LOTUS"". It's sad to see so much potential going to waste. It's discouraging to know that the quality of his music is decreasing. I just hope that next time he decides to come up with an album it shows more of what he truly is; A GREAT MUSICIAN, and not a back up guitar player as he seems in this album."
negative,"ugh!: I couldn't wait for this book to come out after seeing the previews for the movie based on the book. Now I'm afraid to see the movie! This book is really awful. The characters are not likable at all and the stuff that happens between Julie cooking is not something I want to read about. Finally, I really don't care for all the swearing. Between the swearing and the whining I was not inspired to cook or see the movie."
negative,"Not even worth considering it as an opition: I have already returned mine that I bought from here. Trust me, it's not worth the $50. It made my hair really frizzy and is more of blow dryer than a straightener. When I usually straightener I like to listen to music or watch TV, but with this I can't do either because it makes that noise that blow dryers make. It just really doesn't straighten hair that well either. Save yourself a lot of regret and don't buy it."
negative,"Absolutely awful controls! DO NOT BUY: I am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series, and have played all five other games on my PC. I love them. I was so excited to get this one, and sooooo disappointed with the quality. Glitchy glitchy glitchy. Do not buy this game. The controls are terrible. While all other 5 games play out smoothly, this one is slow, stalls, goes blank some times, and takes minutes to load to new chapters. Now I don't have a fancy schmancy computer, but I have been able to play all the other games on it just fine without any hitch. This is just crap. It makes me feel like I have to go buy a $2000 computer just to be able to play this $30 game! It probably runs better on a PS 2, so if you have one of those don't bother with the PC version. Thanks a lot Eidos, I totally wasted time and money and am warning future buyers to BEWARE!"
positive,"Jabra Ear Gels: a comfortable and economical alternative for earhook type Bluetooth headsets.: Excellent product. I was having difficulty hearing and also getting a comfottable fit with the included ear hook that came with my Jabra JX-10 Series II Bluetooth headset. I removed the hook and attached one of the 6 gels that came in the pack to the headset and found that the volume increased 40% and I was able to achieve a comfortable fit. The headset is small enough and light enough that the gel holds the headset in the ear. I was about to give up on this headset (and all earhook type Bluetooth headsets) prior to getting the gels. If you are looking for a comfortable (and econimical) alternative for earhook type headsets, I strongly recommend that you give these a try. They are well worth the price."
negative,"A letdown: Somehow I missed the fact that all the designs were illustrations (watercolor paintings?), not photographs. I get inspired by looking at photos of existing gardens that someone actually created. Looking at paintings just doesn't do it for me. Besides, as the other reviewer said, these gardens are for zones all over the US, not necessarily for my zone, so not all the ideas work for me.The other thing that is missing in this book is at least a small photo of each of the plants/flowers on a page. Sure, I can look them up in another book. I'm familiar with quite a few of the flowers and their Latin/common names, but a beginning gardener wouldn't be. This is definitely not a book for beginners, and even as a more advanced gardener, it was disappointing."
negative,"Disc #2 would not play on our blueray/DVD player!! dont know how to fix or exchange it.: The Disc #2 would not play on our blueray/dvd player and I am very disappointed. Since it was shipped from Canada via Amazon, I do not know how to resolve the problem."
positive,"Must have: For years my sister-in-law reused her plastic bags and I thought she was nuts. Over time, she accumulated a over a million dollars by being frugal. However, everytime I went to her house, she had these plastic bags hanging over her faucet in the kitchen and it took forever for them to dry. Now, they dry in 10 minutes and she doesn't have to end up drying them by hand. I also have one and love it for drying plastic bottles that I reuse. Of course it's also a conversation piece because everyone that walks in the door asks ""what is that"". I love it and have started reusing my plastic bags too. That way they don't end up in the land fill."
positive,"Great followup, but I like the debut better: This is now doubt 1 of the best albums of 1998. It is very reminiscent of the debut, but the more I listened to it, the more it was a little too much on the techno side. Shirley's voice saves that, though. The 1st track ""Temptation waits"" reminded me a lot of the power that ""Supervixon"" had, & ""Special"" was better before radio started killing it. And just like the 2 slow songs in the debut, the slow tracks 8 & 12 have the same hypnotic effect. I overplayed this ALMOST as much as the debut, & even though I like the debut a little more because of the slightly darker tone, I wasn't disappointed with this cd. Garbage just plain rocks."
positive,"THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This movie is fabulous. It is one of my all-time favorites. John Wayne, Katharine Ross & Jim Hutton do a wonderful job."
positive,"very good: this book is very good, I couldn't put it down. the whole book was perfect, it was old fasion."
negative,"Let's get the facts straight, people....: The Earth's *surface area* is nearly 70% water, but its total mass is a paltry 0.023% H20. That's hardly significant. In the human body, water is distributed differently in various areas: lean muscle tissue contains about 75% water; bood contains about 83% water; body fat contains 25% water and bone has 22% water. Total % body water also varies considerably from infancy to adulthood, between men and women, and between individuals. These things can hardly be considered ""coincidence"" by any stretch of the imagination. The connection between water and life is well understood, straight-forward, and ,frankly, obvious. There's no need for magical thinking, weird mysticism, or silly books (like this one) to make the point that our water supply is precious and must be protected. Only an *irrational* person would argue against that."
positive,"The Dead Kennedys of our generation?: It might just be! That means a hell of alot too. It's a shame that that this band is labled 'nu-metal', becuase honestly, this is the most punk rock thing I've heard in a while. Hell, even the singer makes me think of good ol' Jello. I'm not a big fan of radio suppourt but this band diserves it. Some of the best lyrics in mainstream rock.Thumbs up"
positive,"a brilliant, well-written economics primer: Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the ""common good."" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand."
positive,"Warm and Cozy: These slippers are just what I needed- something to keep my cold feet warm and cozy. My only criticism is that the toe is pointy, so I had to get used to my toes being a little squished.And definately buy 1 size up. I'm a size 8 and the 9 fits well."
positive,"One of the best scripted ""westerns"" ever: This is one of my all-time favorite westerns. The acting and directing are terrific with an unusually colorful, eloquent script. It's just off-beat enough to make you want to watch it again. It's a lttle like ""Tom Horn"" (starring Steve McQueen), only more humorous in a dark sort-of-way."
positive,"IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND WILD... PHENOMENAL !!!!: WOOOOOOWWWWWWW. This is THE PERFECT BABY MAKING ALBUM OF ALL TIME. R.KELLY IS THE BEST ARTIST AND MUSICIAN OF ALL TIME. HE MAKING HIT ALBUM AFTER HIT ALBUM. And TP-2.COM is THE BEST R&B;/SOUL ALBUM EVER MAKE. It has what every person needs in his life SATISFACTION. THIS ALBUM MAKES ME FORGET OF ALL PROBLEMS OF LIFE. Also makes Me feel more strong and passionate person. I don`t know why it has the ""Parental Advisory"" sign, IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL AND INSPIRING. ALL the 19 Songs are the BEST I HEARD IN MY LIFE, LISTEN CAREFULLY...IT`S MAGICAL MUSIC BY THE R&B; KING. A UNBELIEVABLE, PHENOMENAL CLASSIC.EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THIS MASTERPIECE...ESPECIALLY TRUE LOVERS.THE BEST SLOW JAMMING ALBUM OF ALL TIME. BUY 3 COPIES OF IT !!!"
negative,"Terrible: Rocket from the Crypt is easily my favorite band, and until I heard this album I thought they could do no wrong. However, All Systems Go Volume 1 proved me wrong. Even for a b-sides collection this is really awful. Most of the songs aren't even listenable, and the ones that are are usually ruined by stupid sound effects or vocal distortion. ""Live the Funk"" starts out well, but is unlistenable after the first minute due to Speedo repeating the same line roughly 83 times. They completely butchered their cover of the Big Bopper's ""Chantilly Lace"" by adding some stupid talking over the song; unfortunate because it would have been a good cover. If you're looking for Rocket from the Crypt, I would suggest ""Scream Dracula, Scream"" or ""RFTC"" over this rubbish."
negative,"Far from complete: I was very disappointed that some big Hollywood stars were not in the book (including some that were easy to come by), and yet so many stars that I've never even heard of were filling so many pages. I've been a serious Hollywood autograph collector and enthusiast for over 20 years and was upset to see some of the bigger stars not included. Some big and popular stars missing were Dustin Hoffman, Orson Welles, Cyd Charisse, Christopher Reeve, and Gloria Swanson. And who in the world is Kelly Reno? Sherilyn Wolter? Jackee Harry??A waste of my money."
negative,"Are you kidding me?: Of Mice and Men was an assigned reading in my class. At first I thought it was good (in the first chapter), but then I read on. The book did not suit me. I would not recommend this book to anyone, because I thought it was a bad story. The author's writing style was good, but the plot was stupid. Some of the characters were believable, but others were very inrealistic. The ending was very sad, and you would have never seen it coming."
negative,"Tiresome, simplistic romance: Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award. Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19. Lauded by the literary types as exemplifying Austen's wit and irony, it's really just a simplistic romance in which all characters spend far too much ink flapping their gums."
positive,"Great Expectations: I like the book ""Great Expectations."" I really like this book and many lessons can be learned from it.Pip handles most of his situations pretty well except for at the end.From the first time he saw Estella he knew she was his love and he never gave up.I thought it was neet how the convict helped Pip after Pip had helped him.I also thought it was cool that all through the book you think Pip's benefactor is the old lady, but at the end you figure out it is the convict.I dont really like the fact that Pip's aunt beat him.I also thougth it was pretty low of Estella to treat Pip how she did, and yet he would do anything for her.It was kind depressing at the the end because you know Pip wont get Estella.I also thought it was mean of Pip to just desert Joe after all he had done for him.When the convict gets caught at the end it is kinda sad because you just dont think he should.Anyone would like this book if they were into realistic fiction."
positive,"Progressive Jazz-Fusion Theatrical Circus Rock Band: This album (the band's second) shows a strong growth in songwriting confidence. Their innovative instrumentation, including the use of instruments not normally associated with Rock 'n' Roll creates a unique and refreshing sonic landscape. The songs on this album range from electronica-inspired dance music to ballads, each with its own distinctive character. This is a band with high musical ideals, challenging arrangements, and lyrical content that explores the darkness, excitement, hedonism, and banalities of life with a fresh perspective. The songwriting is frequently epic, with long stretches of wonderful instrumental bridges. ""Beneath Topeka"" deserves wide-spread airplay. Add this CD to your library! You won't be disappointed if you enjoy hearing ambitious and talented musicians stretching the limits."
negative,No Kathy Smith: When I ordered this tape it was build as Kathy Smith. I even returned the tape twice. Thinking I would get the Kathy Smith tape. I ended up giving up and keeping this tape. I don't care for it. There are better tapes out there
negative,"Good effort and concepts, but definately not THE system: I only gave this book 2 stars because it felt like a disspointment. Purchasing this book over the internet without looking through the book first at a local bookstore was a mistake. The System had a few good points, but on the whole it basically restates common facts like making eye contact, playing hard to get, and some basic psychology of women. When I first got the book I was surprised that it was so small; easily readable the first time through. Mispellings and typos also caught me offguard for a published book with such a distinguished ranking on Amazon. I wish there were more precise intructions/outlines for do's rather than dont's(ie. miroring a woman's bodylanguge). My advice to you is to skim through the book before you purchase it to see if its of value to you. I am considering purchasing The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene as a necessary follow-up."
negative,"Picture is way off...: The faces in the close ups are cut halfway so you basically only see their eyes and you miss a lot of stuff happening in the scenes. I love the show. This is a rating on the quality of the video playback, Not the show."
positive,"I love it .... I love it....I love it.....: i saw the Romeo and Juliet movie of 1968 the first time in our german lesson! i always thought, there couldn`t be a better R&J video than that one with Leonardo and Claire,...but now i know it better! Because the version of Franco Zefferelli is the very very very very best movie in the world! the actors are great and wonderful, the music....the coustumes...and the true romance is unbelievebal! I cry every time when i see it (by the way, i saw it about 54 times till NOW *g*). I wish nothing more than meeting these two actors, because they are my stars and for me the very very best actors in the world!!p.s.: sorry for my worse english...i am still learning *g*"
positive,"200 Km/H in the AWESOME MUSIC Lane: t.A.T.u. is a very unique duo. Their voices are different from the rest of the music today and that is great. Lena and Julia (the girls of t.A.T.u.) are truly talented and are not just studio creations. The first U.S. released single ""All The Things She Said"" is the best song on the album. The rest of the songs including ""Not Gonna Get Us"" and ""Clowns"" shows their unique voices. This is a must for any music collector. Don't let their image fool you (although there is nothing wrong with their image), these girls are very talented and deservce to have their CD in your collection."
positive,"""Plant lavender for luck. Fall in love whenever you can."": A beautiful and magical story about love and the bond between sisters, with the author's trademark mystical touch. One of my favourite books."
positive,"Spence steals the show: First, a warning: this is the colorized version of this classic black and white film, so avoid it if you're a film connoisseur. The original black and white version is infinitely superior to this poorly done colorization.Now, the good news. This film showcases Spencer Tracy's remarkable acting ability and he delivers a witty and intelligent performance as Elizabeth Taylor's long-suffering father. Spence has several monologues which are a joy to watch. His acting gift (along with Charles Laughton) is an absolute wonder and it's always a pleasure to watch him. Joan Bennet is adequate in a supporting role and Elizabeth Taylor is breathtaking as the 18-year-old soon to be wed daughter. Liz's performance is actually quite good and her interplay with Tracy is especially effective.Yes, this movie is dated in places, but Tracy's performance is worth watching the entire movie. He is in nearly every scene and transforms a seemingly average movie into something really special."
negative,"Highly Disappointing: A good old boy with high hopes of getting into a life of crime rises to the top and lives the good life before experiencing marital problems, doing some jail time, and eventually becoming a paranoid cocaine addict as the walls of his decadent lifestyle come tumbling down around him. Anyone familiar with Scorsese's GoodFellas will recognize the similarities and do themselves a favor by watching it again instead of this copycat. Blow is a fair enough film for those who aren't too choosy about what they watch--it seems unfortunate, though, to waste time watching it when you could instead be seeing the highly superior films that it borrows from (GoodFellas, Boogie Nights)."
negative,"Heart of a Jaguar review: I thought that the book was not the best I have EVER read, it was NOT a book I would recommend to people and that I would like to read again. I don't recommend it because it is VERY graphic in details about sacraficing. The ending was my favorite part was the ending. If you want to know something about the Maya"
negative,"very poor quality fall apart pajamas: I bought these in August for my Father and he loved them. Upon visiting him this Christmas (4 months later), I discovered that he had stopped wearing them. The bottom had ripped away from the waist band and a button came off. The pajamas are of course now useless. Went to order someone new ones, and of course these came up on the search. Don't buy this inferior quality for this much money! Not a good deal"
positive,"No progress in people's gullibility: The author tracks historical mass-mistakes with such clarity that it is easy to see the parallels with the world of today.As has been noted in other reviews, the current stock market overinflation and collectibles craze are clearly paralleled by previous events. A parallel which I haven't seen in other reviews here is the current 'alien invasion/x-files' obsession with the long running belief in alchemy. The same figures play roles.. the naive believer and the swindling fraud, most prominently.Our current astrology revival is only the latest wave of belief in this ancient 'art' and homeopathy has much in common with 'animal magnetism.'I think that every young person, every person should read it to gain an appreciation of the tools we have to sort out the sense from the nonsense as well as a historical perspective on how much human nature has not changed in its eagerness to believe in the face of reason."
positive,"great purchase: great book, great presentation, first time i bought something for kindle. really please so far. looking forward to new titles and new features for kindle."
positive,Awesome CD: This is one of the best CDs i've purchased. All of the song are alive and different. Real good bass and good all around audio sound. This currently one of my favorite CDs. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
negative,"This is ridiculous!: BUYER! PLEASE BE ADVISED! THEY POST THE WORD FLASHLIGHT(S) WITH AN S. THEY POST A PICTURE OF ""4"" FLASHLIGHTS! THEY TELL YOU YOU CAN KEEP ONE IN THREE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AS OPPOSED TO USING THE WORD ""OR"". THEY CHARGE 19.95, BUT THIS IS ALL ONLY FOR ONE FLASHLIGHT! JUST ONE! WHILE OTHERS CHARGE 6.99 AND 7.25 FOR THE EXACT SAME 21 LED FLASHLIGHT, THEY CHARGE 19.95, USE THE WORD FLASHLIGHTS<<< AND SHOW 4 LIGHTS. MISLEADING! THEY TELL YOU YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF FOUR, BUT NOWHERE DO YOU GET TO CHOOSE ANYTHING! JACKS TOOL SHED SELLS THE SAME LIGHT FOR ABOUT 7.25. THINK ABOUT IT. WHY ARE THEY SHOWING 4 LIGHTS, HAVE PLURAL LIGHT(S) AND CHAGE 19.95 FOR THE SAME EXACT LIGHT? ALTHOUGH SOME HAVE TOLD ME THAT YOU RECEIVE LIGHTS WITH BURNED OUT LED'S/ NOT SURE, BUT YOU GET THE PICTURE. VERY SAD!"
negative,"not worth it: Bought this in December 08, we use it like anyone would, cleaning 1-2 times per week. the unit started making noise, then smelled, I pulled the bottom cover off and discovered the that the bearings that support the beater bar are made of felt, and had self destructed. I know $ 89 is cheap for a vacuum, i guess you get what you pay for."
positive,"Buddy the cat is the best: I heard about the CD with clips and an interview with Ry Cooder on NPR and immediately ordered it. The book and CD are just great. As a union member myself I was glad to have a musical record of some of the history of the movement, which has not been taught for years in the schools. Buddy and his friends journey across a dusty and violent America and try to find work. The pictures on the story book are priceless. The travelers have many adventures, and Buddy gets thrown in jail for being ""red,"" such a great joke on the union busters. Enjoy! I sent another copy to my brother in California, he loves it too."
negative,"Just say NO THANKS!: Being an avid Bowie fan and an equally avid classical music fan, how could I resist this cd ? I was extremely disappointed in the sound quality and the musicianship.. it sounded as if the musicians had no style of their own, they were mechanical... The only good thing about this cd is it makes a nice coffee table coaster."
positive,"Love the title song: I bought this CD for the title song. It is the same as in the movie ""Rio Bravo"" (my husband's favorite movie which we watch all the time). There is a strange intro by John Wayne but doesn't take away from the song, which seems to be cut off at the end just a few seconds too soon. I like several other selections, including the theme from ""The Searchers"". The others are OK with some that are strange. Why have Lorne Greene half/talk-half/sing the ""Bonanza"" theme? Just give me the real thing. The CD has songs you wouldn't find just anywhere and I like that. I really wanted the Dean Martin/Ricky Nelson title song and the CD was worth it to me."
positive,"It is light and pleasant novel. Well written, as are all her books.: It is possible to read, put down and pick up again without losing thought processes. Have read it prior and seen the movie. Like that era as well."
positive,"You can never go wrong with C.S. Lewis- The perfect gift idea!: These books are wonderful and a ""must have"" for any C.S. Lewis fan. They are light weight and easy to handle. The print is very small so I wouldn't recommend this particular set for anyone with vision problems. The type is double spaced though, making it easier to read. If you are looking for a gift for a devoted Christian, this set of books would be a safe bet."
positive,umbrella for stroller: I loved this umbrella. We were able to provide our baby with shade from the front and sides with the flexible stem. It has a clip for quick removal making it easy to tuck in a fold up stroller when putting it in the car. The only unfortunate complaint I have is the part that attaches it to the stroller is a little fragile. Ours broke but for the price I bought another one. It's worth keeping the sun out of Babies eyes and preventing sunburn.
positive,"Simply Fantastic!: It took me quite sometime to actually read 'Clan of the Cave Bear', and when I did, I could finally see why it was so popular, but there was much more...Valley of the Horses followed, and there was no turning back, I read all three in one weekend. And then Plans of Passage hit the book stores, and, well like so many can't wait for the fifth, and here's counting on a sixth. I thank Jean for such an impressive story. Thanks again:)"
negative,"so so game: I found this game to be a bit disappointing. There is a lot of dialogue to sit through and i found myself anxious to begin some game play. I also needed to download a patch in order for the game to stop locking up during play. In addition, there seems to be a glitch in loading a saved game. I need to start a new game and load from there."
positive,"Truely Inspirational: I was fortunate to view this at the NYC premiere. I was in total awe. After shaking hands with Kitty Carlisle Hart and saying Hi to the most recently departed Fay Wray, I was just amazed. It was an experience I will never ever forget. I also saw Miss Celeste Holm, Tommy Tune, Chita Rivera. It was totally wonderful! The film was excellent. I wanted to just sit there for hours and hours listening to what the actors and actresses had to say. Their stories were fascinating. Which is what a Documentary should be. Telling the story about what life was like. Giving the ""Inside Scoop"" I hope I will be able to see the sequel to it. Anyone who says this film is Amateurish obviously overlooks the fact that this film will be a classic and should receive an Oscar Nomination, if not the Oscar for best Documentary. Anyone guy who can go and interview over a hundred stars, has to be amazing.Go and buy this DVD!!!! It is worth every Penny!"
negative,"Audio Doesn't Work! Buyer Beware!: As soon as the movie would started, and the audio switches to DTS-HD, it would either go totally quiet or make this little clicking noises like there were aliens trying to talk to us. Unfortunately I didn't know there were problems with this disc, so I spent all kinds of time fooling around with my equipment. Buyer Beware! They are having issues with DTS-HD audio on this movie. It did work when I switched to Dolby Surround, but who wants to listen to that if your into uncompressed audio?"
positive,"White Plastic Kitchen Bowl Set is amazing!: I truly love cooking with these bowls. The surface makes clean-up easy and the depth allows for me to throw an unlimited amount of concoctions into it. These bowls and strong and sturdy so that they will last forever and take all the wear and tear of cooking and the dishwasher. Overall, I'm very impressed with this product."
positive,Helping to Heal: My husband and I just lost our oldest son to suicide. This movie was recommended by a good friend. It has helped us tremendously in dealing with those who still have conflicted ideas about suicide.
positive,"Verbal Penetration: Punany Poets (My review): This book was everything I expected and more. I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for someone else but after I read some of it, I have decided to order a copy for myself. I will continue to purchase any book that has been written by this author and they now have a life long fan."
negative,"Not as advertised: This book is promoted and is categorized as a financial (personal) book. It is not. The book strikes me as having been written off of the top of one's head. It is confusingly and illogically laid out. And it is virtually devoid of useable advice.Don't waste your money on this thin, overpriced book."
negative,"Why not Bruce Cockburn instead?: Why not get the real thing? Steve Bell can sing, but no one can do Cockburn's songs like the man himself can. If you like what you hear from these samples, buy Bruce Cockburn's album(s) with the original songs instead. These covers aren't very good either. At least the Barenaked Ladies got creative with ""Lovers in a Dangerous Time."" Steve Bell does a poor job of arranging and his high voice doesn't go well with the jaded sound of Cockburn's music."
positive,"One of the best albums of all time: If you're gonna buy an Oasis record or any for that matter, this is a great one to get. Every song is catchy as hell. Just great pop rock songs. Noel Gallagher is one of the best songwriters ever. Liam's voice is awesome the whole way through, and you'll find you can't get the songs out of your head. Slide Away is the song that grabbed my attention and made me want to purchase this album and become a bigger fan. What you'll find is all their songs are good, and you'll wonder what you've been missing. All their albums are good."
negative,JUNK JUNK JUNK IN A BOX: RECEIVED THE KEURIG -- WAS NOT PACKAGED VERY WELL .. NO MANUAL--OR BOOKLET .. AND DID NOT MAKE COFFEE -- SAID IT WAS BREWING -- BUT NO WATER CAME OUT -- TRIED EVERYTHING TO NO AVAIL... SENT IT BACK...
negative,difficult 2 stars: the worst of the serie.I liked the 3 first ones but this one is a waste of time and money.It is totaly boring with lack of génious and inspiration.I will be cautious buying the next one to come..if it comes.
negative,"Sent back for refund: This particular sharpener runs hot, before completing a sharpening of one raw pencil. Once the motor cools, approx. 15-20 minutes, you can begin again. I sent this back for a refund. Perhaps this was a lemon?"
negative,"An enormous disappointment: As a fan of both Costello and Frisell, I was pleased to see this record come out - it's been a long tradition in jazz to play around with pop songs, and I thought it was an exceptional idea to choose them from this great Costello/Bacharach album.The result is terrible, however. Yeah, everyone is playing the notes very nicely, but these are merely rote and exceedingly pallid, mainly instrumental verions of the originals, which on the first album are full of much more passion and spontaneity. There is no imagination or inspiration here, no sense of even an attempt to make the music their own. It seems inexplicable that no one involved in this project could hear how dull and lifeless it was. And on a personal level, Billy Drewes is a taste I perhaps will never acquire. Don't waste your money, this is an awful record."
positive,"Nice Luther Movie: This is a well done movie with good acting and nice cinematography. I was impressed by the director's and producer representation of historical events, particularly those that show some of the disagreements between Luther's intentions and those of some of his followers. I highlight this aspect of the movie because oftentimes it is downplayed or ignored."
positive,"Great!: Love them. They work well on my long, moderately skinny baby. They are my go-to disposable. I probably won't order them again since we're switching to cloth full time."
negative,Does not straighten: When i used this all it did was smooth out my hair and added flips at the ends. It does not make you hair bone straight. As soon as you go outside your hair is puffy again. It does the same thing as my old $20 styler did. I guess using this to dry your hair and then use something else to straighten it would work. But why should i have to buy a second straighter when this thing suppose to do it for you. I also think the model on this box actually has naturally straight hair that is why it is so straight and smooth. Luckily i took it back and got a complete refund. I guess i will stick with my old straightner.
negative,"Terrible: I bought this popcorn without reading the ingredients. I never would have guessed that it would contain artificial sweetener. I made a bag, and soon had a funny aftertaste in my mouth. A familiar aftertaste. Sucralose! Who would expect to find that in a non ""diet"" popcorn! WHY??? They ruined it. It went in the trash. We don't like the taste of artificial sweeteners and we don't like the fact that one's body doesn't know what to do with them."
negative,"Femalien: The R rated DVD of this movie is not worth the price. It's cut to smithereens. Buy the unrated version, instead."
negative,Seems every time Van Damme plays a bad guy he does his mute method acting: Black Eagle was released a few months after Van Damme became a star with Bloodsport. The film could have made Van Damme a wash up but luckily it didn't. The martial arts chorography in the film is very sloppy and the fight scene between Sho Khogusi and Van Damme is weak. Skip this one
positive,"I'm very impressed so far: So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box. Like some have said, takes a few minutes to get used to it. I've been wearing it for 5 hours now and I just love it. It covers everything that needs to be covered (and I am long-waisted). It stays put, which I love. It's comfortable. It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach ""pooch"". It's comfortable enough to sit in. Best of all, instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support. I'm looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future. I wonder if I can wear it on my runs? Hmmm... Also: I have a size 31 inch waist and the medium fits perfect on the first loops. Just take your measurements before you order. Hopefully, as I lose weight (from my running/training program) I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a little more use out of it. Well... then I'll just have to get a size small! I love it!"
positive,Great little tool: I bought this because of errors on my Nikon camera to see if cleaning the contacts for the compact flash card would correct the issue. One cleaning and the errors are going. I'm going to use this to make sure all my cards are getting a clean contact with the device they're in. Pretty great fix if it prevents the need to send the device in to the manufacturer.
positive,"Quite Good: As a huge HP fan, I awaited for the release of this movie impatiently. I was a bit (not a LOT) dissapointed with it though. I feel that it went too fast, and some of the main stuff found in the book, like Dobby, were left out. I wouldn't have minded if the movie was an extra 30 minutes longer and contain more stuff. Still, it is a good movie. What I hope (without joking) is that the 7th movie be the best one ever made, and a potential contender for the Best Film of the Year award."
positive,An excellent continued from Mummmy 1 view (though literized if i may be allowed to use that word) of Ancient Egypt: A perfectly marvelous continuation of Mummy 1 of ancient Egypt . The Graphics and special effects truly enhance the story and are not a substitute for a Story as we see far too often in other movies with second third and etc additional follow up versions of the original. Graphics are truly stupendous and Mr. Fraser does a great job in portraying quite a charachter. this is one movie Im sure youll enjoy as much as the Mummy 1.
negative,sucked redlands ca: This book was a bland romance book.I am twelve year old boy so dont get be wrong that i read love books.Theonly reason i had to read this book was because my mom made me read it for homeschooling.I would no recomend this book for boys.Girls may be wild about this book but i think the book was crappy.But i gave little men a very good read.You can read it if you type in little men.Go to second page and its the first book on the top.Please read it.
negative,"Disappointed !: As a huge fan of the group, I was disappointed with this item. The interview disc is poor quality and was basically audio from existing early interviews which most fans would have already. The content is dated and is pre reunion.The book has some nice pictures which again, are all pre 'comeback'I would'nt really recommend the item to existing fans, there is'nt really any content of interest. The cover card was scraped on arrival and looked shabby despite having been well packaged."
positive,"This book is helpful!: Up front I will admit I have a bias (my company Pileated Pictures is featured on the book), but having been a professional involved with Animation and interactivity for years, and knowing the other people involved with this book, I can honestly say it is very useful and pragmatic, getting into fundamental concepts behind character animation in Flash, and a good luck at several techniques. My two cents."
negative,"Grab a couple, mine was a dud: Grab a couple of batteries. Mine was a dud after 2 months. It would not charge. Battery seems slightly better than the original. (While it lasted)"
negative,Overrated Book: Charles Dickens and this book are very overrated. Charles Dickens does not make anysense in this book. Very confusing. The talks about the same subject forever. I skipped a whole chapter and he was still talking about the same thing. I give this book a minus 200 on a scale from 1-5.
positive,"Horror Movies: A classic movie, still spooky after all these years. You can see the difference between good and evil through-out this film."
negative,"Disappointing: This is another case of a well prepared advertisement campaign. Weeks before the film entered the cinemas the world was praising the film as something nobody else had ever seen before. Now, there lay exactly the problem. The 1964 version of ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" (with Sophia Loren) tells more or less the same story but without all the sound effects available now. Take those Dolby Suround/THX effects and you will have a very dull story. That's why I insist watching The Fall of the Roman Empire might lack some technical quality but it beats The Gladiator in most parts. If you like battle scenes and man-to-man fights you get the right movie. Anything beyond that is an insult."
positive,"Really good value for the money: I needed a wireless card for my desktop PC as it was moving to another room and I don't currently have the time to run a coaxial connection in there for the cable modem.I picked this card based on the rating and reviews here. I am happy to say that they were very accurate and this is a really good card, especially given that the price is so low compared to other, brand name cards.Installation was very simple and the signal strength and speed are perfect. I was in a hurry so I just used the Windows wireless client instead of the dedicated, included software but perhaps if I get time later, I will try running that.All in all, you simply can't go wrong with this card - right price and very good performance."
negative,"Disappointed in The Children's Illustrated Bible: This Bible is much smaller than I expected, and the print is so small that you almost need a magnifying glass to read it. A young reader would lose interest quickly because of the print size. Next time when I order I will be sure to check the dimensions.This book would not sell in a book store, as a potential buyer would walk away if they could see the size and format. The pictures are nice, tho small.I bought this for my grandson for Christmas, but I was too embarrassed to give it to him."
positive,"Great Tasting Yeast Flakes: We use Brewers Yeast for added flavor/texture on popcorn and other foods. Kal is the BEST tasting yeast flakes that we have found and the entire family loves it including our two young children. Best of all, it's low fat and very high in important nutrients. We can't seem to get enough of this stuff."
positive,The Insider: Excellent mivie (DVD) it shows just how low big tobacco goes. They would do anything to feed their greed.
negative,"Embarrasing America: MIDWAY is one of the very worst movies ever made. There really was no imagination used in its making. Many of the fight scenes were from Tora!Tora!Tora! The war footage had too many scenes from the late war period. Whoever wrote the screenplay is clueless about the facts of the battle. Like a good fiction writer, he never let the facts get in the way of a good story. If we were as inept as the the producers and directors then we should have lost the Pacific War to the Japanese."
positive,"Angle Stapler Good\Bad: Excellent tool but did not last. The mechanism that pushes the staples out when it fires, came out and will not stay in. Had to return it."
positive,"The one cookbook I turn to again and again!: The gorgeous photos make you want to read this book cover to cover. It is filled with heavenly recipes that (so far) have turned out beautifully. Of my rather large collection of various cookbooks, this is the one I continue to turn to for the most reliable and delicious dishes."
negative,"BIG THUMBS DOWN: I rented this thinking it would be an interesting subject on American-Chinese tradition here in the U.S. But I was wrong, it was a total disappointment. The story and its sub-plots are too contrived. The script is very formulaic; even adding a twist at the ending was typical and intentional - just so for audiences who likes a twist in their movies. Any viewer wouldn't get involved watching this film. Basically this is about a group Chinese-American siblings who has hang-ups with themselves and among each others. Set in the affluent neighborhood of San Francisco, it portrays an embarrassingly rich family by showing the amenities of the matriarch's sprawling extravagant house. Tennis, a dip in the pool, jacuzzi anyone? Jeez! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
positive,"Incredible: Simply amazing, if you are a fan of letters then you will find it impossible to not enjoy this book."
positive,"They work okay, no longer supported by chamberlaingroup.: I've owned two of these, the first one we had for a while and it worked without issue, wanted to get a second one for another vehicle. However the unit I got from Amazon (prime 3rd party seller) was old maybe used, and not working. It would randomly not open or close a door even during repeated presses (not a battery or receiver/opener issue). Asked chamberlaingroup support about the problems with this and they had me check manufacturing date -> it was from 1998 (ordered in 2012). They said they haven't made this unit in years and no longer warranty support it. I ended up returning it to Amazon and getting aLiftmaster 895MAX 3-Button Multi Frequency Remotewhich I didn't realize was compatible with my openers initially. I like the updated 895 model a lot better then my other working 83lm. It seems to have a little bit better range, and looks a lot better."
negative,"Poorly written and heavily biased book: I ordered this book expecting a thorough and unprejudiced recounting of the evolution of copyright law of the past 2 centuries. instead i got a very biased account of it. The author clearly leans toward the notion that copyright law is too restricting and tries to make that point strongly in all the evidence he sites. The evidence itself is not very compelling because it is presented is a very light manner, with very few quotes from actual court decisions. The author instead relies on trying to convince us by presenting his viewpoint of copyright law and his own commentary. instead of a complete account you get a one-sided presentation. The writing is also very elementary and reads as if it was geared toward the second grade. i was very dissappointed with this book and was barely able to finish it. i would not waste my time with this book."
negative,Should I use a Knife !!!!: Gamera is back in the 5th installment gamera vs this knife monster they called guiron.I own all 8 gamera flicks and to saythis one was kinda bad.It seem cheesy in ever way.The dubbing of course is really bad and the whole Guiron monster was alright but instead of a knife head monster why they don't use a fork lol.I know gamera films were on a tight budget but they really made a mess on this one.Alright monster action but story lacks hard.
negative,Never got my item: I love this movie but never had it as my own. Then I saw it for a great price I decied to get it. The order said from Jan 20-Feb 6. I waited and nothing came my way. I couldnt even call UPS because this seller did not give me a tracking number. I will NOT by from this seller again.
positive,"HITTIN"": Just when everyone thought NO LIMIT was falling off, BOOM!!! This CD is tight!!! I have been waiting on this CD for a long time. He is definitely one of the best rappers in the game. He put NO LIMIT back on top with this album. I started to forget about NO LIMIT until I heard this CD. My favorite tracks are The Rock Show, Talk It How I Bring It, Heart Of A Ghetto Boy, I Been Through It All, Mr. Womp Womp, Where Do I Belong, and I Losing My Mind. The whole thing is off the hook!!!!!!!!!!"
negative,"Pseudo-nihilistic garbage. A waste of paper and ink.: What's the point here? It was never fully explicated, and the narrator does not inspire enough interest to carry this woefully inadequate plot - and I use that word loosely. Jamaica Kincaid needs to go back to domestic work"
positive,Serves the purpose: The adjustment wheel tends to slip but it otherwiseworks as well as calipers costing four times the price.Good value.
negative,"Worst Movie Ever Made: If you've ever seen the original you'll know that this film is anything but good. The story arc is poor, there is a total lack of character motivation, and the script seems as if they wrote it as they went along. Very little care was paid to the story when bringing this film to the screen. The only care seems to have been for the special effects. I want my two hours back."
negative,"Possibly Worst Book I've Ever Read: It was hard to believe I was reading Hemingway - but then again, not really. His style of rambling sentences and thoughts was there. But he jumped around a lot. And the subject matter (an insider view of bullfighting) was despicable. Most of the book was spent trying to demonstrate that one was close-minded if one did not appreciate the art of the bullfight instead of getting hung up on the petty issue of the goring of the horses and the killing of the bulls. It was the first book in as long as I can remember that I did not finish. I kept saying it had to get better, since this was Hemingway. Instead, it kept getting worse."
negative,"Hollywood Fluff - Not for Anglophiles.: While it wouldn't be fair to compare this to the A&E Pride and Prejudice, or the BBC's Persuasion, or even Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility as those were stories actually created by Jane Austen whereas this is merely a biography of Jane Austen, perhaps it would then be fair to compare it to Shakespeare in Love, then? In any case, this film fails badly in comparison to any of those. Becoming Jane is painful to observe in many places, especially where they strove, ridiculously, to fit famous phrases from Austen's work into places in the story. This was a thematic idea in the film which I found unendurable."
negative,"Hey, was that supposed to happen?: I though this stuff was supposed to glow in the dark, boy I was disappointed. I am upset because I've been carrying this stuff in my pocket as a good luck stone. My teeth and hair have all fallen out, and my eyes bleed from time to time. The worse was when I went to meet a friend at the airport and set off some alarms and got the snot beat outta me by some TSA goons. Then the FBI took it away from me after questioning me for 4 days! In short, screw this item!"
positive,"HOW ADORABLE: My daughter loves beanie babies, This has got to be one of the cutest, that little face in all of that fuzzy-ness OMGoodness. Very Cute"
positive,"A Passing Resemblance to JKR Goblet of Fire: Great effects and action scenes. You get the Qudditch World Cup, the Yule Ball and the Tournament, but the rest of the JKR story is not even touched upon. I was looking forward to seeing the ""cool"" Bill Weasley with the fang earring, Ludo Baggmann and Charlie Weasley. But even Mrs. Weasley and Percy were left out of this movie, along with the Dursley's. Barty Crouch Jr should never have been introduced as a character in the beginning. A confession under veritaserum at the end of the movie would have better explained his actions."
positive,"Something for everyone: This is a great tool for everyone. Store in car, Garage, basement around fuse box. Never know how many times you may need it and with just a few shakes, you are in service"
positive,"This is the definition of mystery genre. Doyle at his best.: This is the definition of the mystery genre, the best that Doyle has to offer.If you love a good read, a good mystery, a classic tale, get this book.For those who may not want to spend the cash for a hard cover, any of the paper back versions will do. But, the feel and experience of hefting a good hard back while following Watson and his friend, Holmes, should not be missed"
positive,"Amazing book: One of the few classics that are highly engaging. I loved the warmth of love, family, and friendship this book teaches us."
negative,"Love it while it lasts!: First off I will say these weren't purchased from Amazon. I love ordering from Amazon and their customer service. These reviews are strictly for the product itself.I have purchased 2 of these and the first, while cleaned regularly, became so filled with deposits that I didn't want to use it and couldn't get it cleaned out. It quit filling the cup with the amount of water set for the brew size and only filled the cup with about 3 or 4 ounces. Finally gave up on it and purchased another model (better one than the first. It totally stopped working 1 month after the warranty expired, of course! I also have a co-worker who brought one in to work and it sounds like a jet plane taking off. All 3 are Keurig, different models. I'm done with Keurig."
positive,Wonderful!: This was the only book I used to study for the NCEs and it was the only book I needed. It's a great book to get you thinking and exploring what you have learned in the classroom. Well worth the expense.
positive,"Great Blend Of Information & Emotion: The September 11 tragedy still haunts us. While we will never forget that horrible day, Life Magazine provides a book that enables us to reflect on the emotions in NYC, DC and PA, while providing outstanding information about the attacks and aftermath. This beautiful coffee table book includes a forward by Mayor Giuliani. Life Magazine meets, and often exceeds, our expectations with images depicting the horror, sadness, heroism and determination of those impacted. I visited Ground Zero, last week, and began to understand for the first time the true emotion, scope and scar of the attack. ""One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001"" helps all of us do the same."
positive,"I was skeptical, but they work!: I have a new miniature dachshund puppy who is 7 weeks old. Before I brought her home I went to the local Petco the pick up some puppy pads, which are a foreign idea to me, having housetrained previous dogs on newspapers when I was growing up. However, I thought I would give them a shot. Of course there were about 5 or 6 brands to choose from, but I liked the idea that in theory these are extra special because of the ""just-cut grass"" smell they add. Well, I brought them home with low expectations, and I am not saying that she doesn't still have accidents, but I am amazed at how well she is responding to them! Maybe 75% of the time she seeks out the puppy pad on her own accord and uses it. I am about to run out; so I might buy regular pads and see if there is a difference. Overall, I would say they are worth a try, especially since they are only slightly more expensive. Good luck!"
negative,"Viewsonic builds products that don't last: Viewsonic customer service is nonexistent and product support worse than poor. Products are poorly made and will not last. Call technical support 1800-688-6688 and see how long you have to wait for a service rep. Online you get someone to respond who barely speaks English. I bought a plasma TV for $3000 and it failed in less than 3 years. Viewsonic reaction: Too bad, you should have bought a warranty and we'll fix it in 48 hours. Without one, you are on your own. I think something bought for $3000 should last more than 3 years, and Viewsonic should too. Viewsonic intentionally builds products that won't last to sell you an expensive product warranty. I wouldn't buy Viewsonic again and don't think you should either until they built a better product and improve their customer support."
positive,"Great Multiplayer: When I rented this game, I got bored with the 1 player pretty fast. My annoying little brother kept insisting on playing, so we began to play 2 player, and the fun began. I loved how you could beat the game in 2 player mode, which is a nice touch that Goldeneye didn't have. We raced through the games puzzles pretty quickly working together. Thats why I must say that this is the best multiplayer game I have ever had."
positive,"woman of substance: I really enjoyed this book, the way it was written made the characters come to life as you are reading the book. Can't wait to eard the other books that follow"
positive,"Why Not?: YES! That is all I have to say about this movie. TWO VAN DAMMES, it doesn't get any better than this. Separated at birth, both Van Dammes eventually come together and unite as one! YES! The Beverly Hills Van Damme is hilarious with his black silk UNDA-WEAR and should go back to Disneyland! ... But, they work together to fight the worst bad guy who gets crushed with a crate. YES!"
positive,"Good Read as Both Sci-Fi and Analysis of Society: This is one of those books that you here so much about before you have a chance to read it. It makes you seem to think that you know what to expect from cover to cover. You are flat out wrong. Yes, with an overbearing government and a subversive hero this work had me riveted and unable to put it down until I had read it twice. The book can also be likened to a modern day example of Machiacelli's ""Prince"" and had definite anarcho/commune supporting undertones. One of the members of the Inner Party takes the time to explain in detail how a political group can stay in power. The surreptitious ""Book"" explains all there is to know about class struggle and how to eliminate it. Fantastic as both a political and as a literary work."
negative,Bugs: The title is deceptive. It is a children's book with very large pictures of very few insects. I wanted a book with more info than it contains.
negative,"A waste of paper.: This book is one of many written during the ""Bubble Era"" by ""gaijin"" (primarily Americans) who really knew next to nothing about Japan, yet somehow found a publisher, usually Japanese. Another of this quickie genre published about the same time was a book for teaching profanity to Japanese studying English.""Learning to Bow"" may by an accurate account of the author's experience living in Japan and teaching in the JET program. However, that's all it is. It's full of cliches, sweeping generalizations, and offers no insight into living in Japan or understanding the culture. What could the writer possibly know after only two years?"
negative,"Rubbish: Ok, I read the first book and was intrigued. The second book made me a bit restless. The third, I must admit was a complete bore and repeat of the first two. Believe Carlos' if you wish, but this kind of material is very easy to materialise, in which I think ""over-exaggeration"" comes to mind. Perhaps, there are people out there who wish to have been and met such characters, as did Carlos many years ago, which simply means they have very boring lives. This is one book I have read recently which I do not recommend, because it is completely rubbish."
negative,"A half painted room is a sad sight.: My wife started painting our family room after I ordered my ladder, confident that it would arrive in about 3 weeks, just in time to reach the high parts of the wall by the stairs. The other 3 walls were finished but still no ladder. After about a month I went back to check my order to make sure I hadn't accidentally checked 'Wells Fargo Wagon' as the delivery method. Nope, it said 'UPS' as I had remembered. The ladder was finally shipped more than 7 weeks after it was ordered and arrived quickly. Now we can finish the job.This ladder is everything you would want 1) Made in the USA (similar ladders by Cosco, Werner and Gorilla Ladder are made in China) 2) Flexible (any configuration from step ladder to extension ladder) 3) Stong (it feels safe even when fully extended)."
positive,Sad and funny: Jason's graphic novels are great. They flumox many people but I love them andfind them quite real in expressing human emotion. Great graphics.
positive,"CAUGHT WITHOUT WORDS!: This album is a breath of fresh air, more melodic tones, great lyrics and a soft spoken ora about it.alot of bans tend tostay away from there true feelings but the lead singer poises to tell everyone how he feels.maybe you can say they felt alot of emotions writing this album it is truly a masterpiece, yeah there first two albums were poorly mixed but this album surely makes up for that.i just love this album its in my top 5 this year.the best songs are:1.bug eyes2.not that simple3.caught without arms4.planting seedsoverall i give this album a 5/5 perfecto masterpiece5/5 for production5/5 for lyrics5/5 for musical pace5/5 for making me a fan"
positive,"NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR: A very well written piece of literature for its time. In light of the current state of affairs, it is rather frightening. It was a good read in High School and an even better fread today."
negative,Bad package: The package said it contains threaded nozzle for bicycle hand pump. It do miss that in the package. I guess i received the used product.I would not recommend this product.
positive,Fantastic story: I have read and re read this book on a number of occasions and I still love reading it every once in awhile.
positive,"Excellent but a little bit outdated: This is a very good book, provides very detailed instructions how to do some tricks. It has plenty of superb illustrations, so everything is great. There is just one but. A picture taking techniques part is still very valuable, but most of special effects and image manipulations now can be done much easier through digital processing. If you want to add grain to your picture it's so much easier just to scan it and use software then mess with reprints, special contrast materials and processing etc."
negative,"I thought I could...I thought I could...: Unless your Brio set has no hills, you should expect this engine to have trouble. First, on one of the older bridges, the train was too tall, so we had to remove. Next, like other reviewers I just read, this engine has no power. With brand new batteries, and fresh out of the box, it made it up only one hill (one time) without some kind of trouble. This was without any trains attached!If you're going to have hills w/ a Brio set, you should not use a battery operated engine!"
positive,"This is a good product: A good product, but costs a bit too much. I needed this and couldn't find it in any of the stores around where I live."
positive,"The Best Korean Historical Drama: This is the first historical drama that intrigued and entertained me thru the whole 62 episodes. I started watching this drama from a local Korean DTV channel that went off the air at episode 28 (we now have 2 Korean DTV channels). Then I found it and finished watching on the internet. I have been watching Japanese, Chinese, and lately Korean historical dramas since I moved here to Santa Clara, CA twenty years ago. This is the first one I have ever bought. It looks real good on my Plasma. There is so much going on in the drama it will take several times of watching it to catch all the details. This has English subtitles and set the highest TV ratings in Korea of high thirties to high forties thru out the showing last year."
positive,"this girl can spit!: i first heard the track bingo on the radio not long ago, and that has now opened a whole can of worms for me. how can one album be so catchy, raw, fun,fresh ,chunky and funky. while so many rappers drawl on about tired blah blah, MIA just mixes the singing and ragga-ish vocals straight into the most modern type of no-category music with little effort. the style? its kind of UK grime meets hip-hop meets calypso or something. definately a british vibe here, but this is still unique. the beats and sound effects are very well implemented into the chatting. cant stop listening to this. wicked stuff"
positive,"Great!: I love riding my bike, but I don't ride during the colder months. I bought this trainer as a way to keep in shape over the winter, and it's perfect for my needs. It's quiet, it was easy to set up, and it works great. I have seen a few reviews about the magnetic shifter gadget being difficult to attach or use, but I have had no problems with it at all. I'm really happy with this purchase."
negative,Liked the original Peaceful Planet better- from 3rd time mom: My 3 year old had the original Peaceful Planet Aquarium by Fisher Price and it was MUCH MORE PEACEFUL than this item is for my new baby on the way. The orginal was a life saver because my 3 year old loved that. This new model's motor is way too loud and just does not have the attractive features of it's predecessor.
negative,Pampers Baby Dry: I am not a fan of the pampers baby dry. I have a 16 month old and when the diaper gets wet it starts to sag in the bottom to the point where it looks funny and I am sure is uncomfortable for her. The fact that she is such a mover I think makes this not a great diaper for her age. The pamper cruisers are great and that is what she is wearing now. Before I could not decide between the baby dry size 5 and the cruisers size 5 because I really didn't know what the difference was and now I do! The fit!
positive,"Amazing little gadget!: I went to a granddaughter's birthday party today with my wife. The other grandparents were there, other people as well, kids and grownups both. Someone started playing with the Q20 and it passed from one person to another. One of my grandkids thought ""toilet"" and it guessed right away correctly. This is a great little novelty item. I see that it's out of stock now at Amazon. Backorder it or snatch it up wherever you see it as a stockting stuffer."
negative,"THIS MOVIE IS DISAPPOINTING: Stiller and Norton are DEFINITELY NOT at their best. Stiller does a lot of yelling (as does everyone in the show) and Norton seems to be play acting and normally I think these guys are awesome!The story line is weak and unconvincing. There is way too much kissing/sex scenes and there is absolutely NO chemistry between Stiller and ""what's her name"" Really bad. What's her names character is un-believable too. Super high powered flawless business woman. And as if Norton, a priest would go drunk and loud into the synagogue to fight it out with Stiller (who is a Rabi) Stupid.There is one funny moment in this movie and that is when Stiller is out on a date with the aerobics nut and the tug-a-war that ensues afterwards. Hilarious .. But folks -- that is about it.Otherwise it pretty much stinks. 1.5 stars"
positive,"Run Lola Run - foreign film: It's like an episode from the Twilight Zone. Three days, lived over sequentially (same day) and this lady has to RUN across the city looking for a way to keep her boyfriend from being killed by the mob. Each time it ends in his death, then the last time she dies and he's the one who 'saves' her. Their next day completely shifts their life for the better & they're out of the perpetual loop.This actress literally RUNS for about half the movie, she's in great shape! Interesting premise. Fun watching the same people in the background in certain scenes where THEIR lives evidentally are very different each time around.I'd recommend it."
positive,"Fantastic on all Levels!: Before the Happy Hooker, I knew single crochet and chaining. I could make really great scarves, haha. THH has great patterns for home, accessories, and clothes. Plus, the first third of the book is a progression through the levels of crochet, with great illustrations. I love THH because it describes the yarn used in each pattern very well, making it easy to switch out the featured yarn for something more affordable or more easily located. The opening chapter about hook size, yarn types, etc is far more detailed and comprehensive than any other crochet book I've found. I also use the glossary whenever working on a pattern from a magazine, and I need to interpret an abbreviation or a certain stitch. I would reccommend this book to all level of crocheters. I think it has a great introduction to the hooking world, and anybody can pick it up from this book, as long as they aren't afraid of diagrams!"
negative,Hated it: could not stand this book. hated everything about it. waste of my time reading it. maybe just too out of date for today.
negative,"Family film: I did not really care for this film, though, it did have a few funny moments, a lot of the attempts at humor fell flat for me. I really like Martin Short, but didn't think he was very funny in this. It was a little corny. I also thought that it was going to be more of a musical, but there was very little singing, so I was disappointed in that. I also didn't like the moral behind the plot, of the wish itself--getting the little girls dad the role in the play--by using any means to sabbotage the character who had the role. I don't think that's a good message for kids, even if the methods used are done by fairy godmothers. I know a lot of shows do that, like Bruce Almighty, but in even that show, in the end he gave the newscaster's job back to the character that he stole it from. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
negative,"Other than the good effort made by Weisz, the movie is bad: Horrible horror misfire that lacks a lot of brains and lacks a credible leading man for the movie to really fly. While Keanu Reeves is miscast in the worse way, it's Rachel Weisz who steps up to the plate and carries the movie into respectability. Her performance is much better than the story and the special effects that is in this film and for that, the movie is bearable but other than her grand effort to transcend the lousy script, there is really nothing to see here other than her performance.Wait for Dvd."
positive,"Best Movie of 1999!: The Mummy has it all. Action, adventure, lavish scenes, great acting, dialog that makes sense and isn't lame, believeable characters and a great story line! (Did I miss anything?)Yet another classic wonderfully modernized! I loved EVERYTHING about this movie! The effects were amazing and they even paid attention in Egyptology 101! Five Stars for The Mummy."
negative,"You will know very little more after you read this than before: I guess the book is about the taboo of discussing how much you have in your retirement account. Maybe it's about, as it finally gets to in the end, that there are things more important than a specific number and the idle time pleasures they would bring. But god, is this tedious. Entire chapters recounting the goings on a retirement planning meetings from Weyerhauser.There was a bit of reasonable advice, sprinkled throughout, but little and far between."
negative,"This edition is an incomplete text!: This edition omits most everything that appears in the print edition centered in the page, i.e. the poetry and songs like ""The Ballad of Joking Jesus,"" noted by other reviewers. Utterly unacceptable for a book written with care to every word."
positive,"For the price, what I expected: A relatively cheap cable but it does the job. I am not sure it will hold up for very long as this has been my experience with cheap cables."
positive,"Chilling to the core: This book is a fiction masterpiece. It is enormously frightening in a very subtle way. I found it easy to identify with the two main characters, whose lives are forever changed in an instant by the sudden appearance of evil. It reminds us just how very fragile our surroundings really are and how evil can have many, not so obvious faces. At the same time, we see how good can triumph over darkness. Suspenseful to the end, I could barely put the book down."
positive,"Well....I enjoy it.: I bought this album after seeing the ""Toxcicity"" video on MTV2. I had known a few of System of a Down's songs, but after I heard this song, I really liked it. I must admit, I'm a little dissapointed in the album overall, but nonetheless, I enjoy listening to it. I love the songs Chop Suey, Atwa, and Toxicity. Those songs made the album well worth buying. The other songs, however, all sound alike, but are okay to listen to. Despite this, I do not regret buying this album. Be your own judge."
negative,"Amazon.com Rip Off!!!: You can get the hard copy of this for under $60.00! So someone explain why Amazon.com is asking $65.00 for this for the Kindle! They save on paper, packaging, delivery, transportation, etc., etc. Amazon.com seems to have removed ALL incentive from buying the digital version..."
negative,return problems: Shoes were great but needed different size. Return was lost for sometime but finally found. Big hassle!
positive,"trite but true: a picture is worth a thousand words...: saw this on the chris matthews show and ordered it immediately. when it arrived at thanksgiving time, it took two days before i was able to view it--everyone else was reading it and walking off with it. for those of us who were virtually in a state of shock for the first week after 9-11, it is wonderful to be able to view this collection of work. beautifully done, i was at once both grieving at the event yet so very proud to be an american.enough said."
positive,"A great book, though not as good as the first one: I didn't think that this book was as good as the first one, since it had a bit of a slower pace, though it was a good book and a nice edition to the series. In this book, Kit and Nita go on a vacation to somewhere with an ocean, and discover some whale wizards who need their help to defeat the Lone Power. Kit and Nita try to help them, while avoiding suspicians from Nita's parents and her irritating little sister Dairine. All in all, this book had a great plot with excelant characters and a really cool villian. Anyone who likes modernized fantasy would probably like this series, though it would be best for kids 10 and up."
negative,"Disappointing - never thought I would say that: Like a couple of other reviewers, I have everything that Santana has ever done, and have seen the band live a million times.I hate to say this, but the album is a good cure for insomnia. Carlos, what were you thinking?""All that I am"" is messy, with few periods of great guitar work and a wonderful percussion section way under utilized, which has always been the basis of great Santana music in the past.Performances by guest vocalists are mediocre at best.Carlos, you owe it to your loyal fans to create an album with just you and your band of great musicians. Lighten up on the vocals, play more instrumental stuff, and show the World why Santana is second to none in musical ability.By the way, Caravanserai is my favourite."
negative,"Worth the $5, but not much else: The battery worked fine, for a while. But within a month of purchase the connection plate quite literally split off from the battery and rendered it useless. Granted I use two batteries (to allow complete discharge/recharge cycling) so they're pulled in and out of my phone often, but the original battery is still going strong and this one fell apart.Truth be told I probably got my money's worth out of this battery and you probably will to, but don't expect that $5 to get you very far."
negative,"Heart of a Jaguar: I think that this book is an ok book. The author describes the characters and scene well. He uses vivid words to describe the setting. He created a good plot and you could never set the book down. The characters are very adventurous. All the characters have their own personality with different characteristics.There are scenes in which you feel like you are really there. He makes the violent parts dramatic and scary. The author can get carried away at parts but he keeps you hooked through the whole book. You could almost cry at the end. He makes you terrified at violent parts, like you are watching everything happen. There are also some gross parts, when you wish you never read."
negative,B.C fan: This crowes album was by far their worst album to date....whith their departure of bassist Johnny Colt...and lead guitarist Marc Ford...the band has suffered spiritualy and musically...Chris's lyrics are leering more to the clesche Rock..girl relationship bullcrap lyrics...Three Snakes And One Charm had alot more depth and soul in the music...The only song I really dig is HorseHead..because it funks out and it aint about some lovey dubby sappy girl song... Buy Amorica or Three Snakes...those albums will make you cry it's so spritual... Peace and Soul... Zed
positive,"Do Not Mistake for Shoe Polish: I had to shine my shoes the other day for a big event at the office. Unfortunately, I had put my can of uranium ore on the shelf next to the shoe polish. I really wasn't looking closely at the shelf, instead looking at the automotive parts calendar with the big bazoomed blonde in the picture. You know how that goes. That's when I accidentally picked up the can of ore.No sooner had I started shining my shoes when... HULK SMASH!"
positive,"Black man's blues with a white man's feel - for everybody: I must admit that George's 1st 2 albums are his best. His own compositions can't match to the way he does the covers. However, he adds something of his own to the covers which - in my opinion - make them even better - & certainly more contemporary - than the originals !Just saw him live twice in the UK. Man, that guy put on a show ! Can't Stop Lovin' is probably my all time favourite song & I ain't talkin' Elmore James's version !"
negative,"Bad skating technique: I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this."
positive,"Outstanding movie!: This is an excellent film, with more twists and turns in the plot than a snake in a pretzel factory. Highly recommended!"
negative,"a very bad film: is the worst film that y watched in my life, is as stupid as his characters and his public."
positive,"He Had a Great Voice: Matt Monro had a great voice. It's a shame that he never reached greater status in the United States for having such a gift. There are 36 songs on this album and they are all good. His ""From Russia With Love"" vocal from the James Bond film is a classic."
positive,"An absolute classic!: In an attempt to represent the female population, I'm here to say that this movie is great for both genders. It has some of the best fight scenes out of any van damme movie, with my favorite being (of course) the end. Not to mention, there's a great shot of van damme working out above the hong kong skyline...Girls, don't let boys have all the fun! WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
positive,one of the top comics in the world: He is so talented and expressive with his face. I love his humor that is relatively clean but so dead on true.
positive,"Good movie.: I remember the first time I saw this movie, it took such unexpected turns. That's what makes it interesting. Def does a good job reminding us about the things that really matter."
positive,"No leaks for a big boy: I've had a lot of trouble finding a paper diaper that fits my 29 1/2"" long, 23lb 7 month old boy, he's a wiggler, jumper, tosser, turner, and roller, but these seem to fit really well. We've had no poo up the back (even when he poo'd while jumping in his bouncer) and no leaks overnight, both of which were problems before. I haven't had any rashes from chemicals, dyes, or perfumes which was also a problem with other brands in the past."
negative,"the third secret: I enjoyed berry's novel,The Amber Room, and thought this would be worth reading. It wasn't!! The plot was well done,but when it came to the revelation of the ""secret"", I moaned and wanted to toss the book across the room. What a letdown!! I literally laughed out loud and thought just another liberal minded person wrote this book. Very disappointing"
negative,"You gotta be kidding!: This game was nothing of what I thought it would be. I got into the second mission and thought, ""Is this it?"" From what I can tell, there is only 5 missions. I couldn't take anymore past the second mission.You can't scroll around like in SimCity, Restaurant Empire, etc. It just very one dimensional. If you are looking for a game that doesn't have all the bells and whistles, then this is the game for you."
positive,"What did you expect?: Nice sounding CD as a whole. Finally, not a mention of ""bling bling"" on a current release. While many I am certain were hoping for a virtual replay of all of their favorite Clay songs sung during the American Idol competition, this set showcases what a nice voice this young man has. Sure, there is a tinge of ""predictability"" here. Then again, what did you expect? Sit back and enjoy it."
negative,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen: Poor story, worse acting, appalling film making. This film sems to have been made to ""showcase"" the dubious talent of its maker and lead ""actor"". I've seen hammers with more expression and talent. Don't bother unless you're masochistic enough to sit through it. Less enjoyable than chewing tyres."
positive,"Great Game!!: I would recommend this game to all ages 7 and up! The doggies are cute, the contests are fun and even taking a little stroll in the park helps you bond with your puppy! All the breeds are smart and adorable! Except... the German Shepherd. It isn't very cute and is much harder to train. That's the only downfall to this edition. =>"
positive,A Anime must see.: Is one the great anime that will bring tear in your eye. Is very catching and heart breaking same time.
negative,"Grisham losing steam?: If you're looking for the typical Grisham ""thriller"", this is not the book. The Last Juror is disappointing at best! The story that is outlined on the book jacket takes more than one third of the book to unfold. In other words, the book jacket told us the same thing that a full one third of the book told us. The second third is barely readable! It has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. The book is certainly not what the reader is looking for when reading a Grisham novel.Grisham has indeed earned the financial freedom to discover other genre's, but I wish the publisher wouldn't try to fool the reader into thinking this is another legal thriller."
positive,"A little trouble connecting but works fine: I got the card into my computer and installed the software, just as the user guide suggested. It took me over an hour to finally connect, but I don't think this is the fault of the product, just my computer. I have been connected for about 5 minutes now and it works great =). The signal's good (I'm 40 or 50 ft from the wireless router and signal strength jumps between 91% and 95%) and It's about just as fast as my other computer with a physical internet connection. I would recommend it if you're looking for something cheap that works."
positive,"Squirt: Squirt has been an inspiration. They're young and talented, the best thing about them is they're on fire for God by such a young age. Go shien for Him!"
negative,"A Pirate Review: I read Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. I found this book to be not so enjoyable. It begins with slow, hard to follow beginning, and continues with a somewhat sped up middle with many confusing twists and new people. The end I also found to be boring. This just seemed like a short story streched out on many pages lots of new places, characters, or things in between.The parts of this book that I could follow along with were few and even still not inturesting. It took effort to read and keep everything in your head. I had to read over many things twice.If you are an advanced reader, who can keep up with many things I might suggest this to you. If you are inturested in a fantasy like story with pirates, you also may enjoy this. However if you are an average person who just enjoys casually reading or you like to have a book that leaves you on the edge, I would have to say you would not want to read this."
positive,"The must read book before going to Yellowstone!: Whether you plan to drive, hike, swim, fish, camp, take children, take dogs, take pictures, etc; you really should read this book before proceeding with your trip to Yellowstone State Park. A healthy dose of caution never hurt anyone. Excellent narrative, sobering facts, and a quick read. Highly recommended!"
positive,"New slant on an old story: This is a wonderful, funny book exploring the wrestling that people of faith (and their familes) have in trying to follow the way they understand God is leading them.It captures some of the loneliness of faith, and the difficulties that those close to faith explorers face. We all respect those who actually try to live by their convictions, but living with them can be tough.I learned a new swear word, 'rutting' an ingenious way of inserting harsh reality to the dialogue without resorting to course language.Whoever said that stories of faith have a happy ending, this one has a kind of bitter sweet conclusion. I loved the book and I smile at the recollection of some of the classic lines. Would Jonah work?"
negative,"Boooo Harper Collins!: For some reason Harper Collins specifically arranges for Canadians who buy ebooks via the Amazon.com website to get higher pricing and exclude them from sale pricing. I can't imagine why, it takes no more to deliver to us wirelessly and I'd have to assume our converted US funds are just as good."
negative,"This P.Shop Class-OK for Web Use ONLY- Not Image improvement: If your lookking for the latest on web design techniques, you will enjoy this teaching seminar. If you are looking for image improvement skills, color management to print, etc. , this set of tapes will leave you very disappointed."
positive,"The best text book in the field so far: Only after having to read and digest so many boring and endless text books, first medical ones, and then psychological, I can apreciate a good one when I see it. ""Abnormal Psychology"" is an easy to read, elegantly formated, and very interesting book about the subject. It is not, however, what one might call popular sceince type. Fitting very well for 1st-2nd year students, it will serve as a waem welcome into the world of pathopsychology."
positive,"a tidal pool of humanity: At times hilarious, at others poignant, this is a snapshot of life in early 20th century Monterey. The language is poetic and metaphoric. The plot, which is mostly Mack's attempts to give Doc a party, is broken occasionally by short ""interludes"", little paintings of other characters that may or may not be seen again. Like a tidal pool after the tide is out, this book is teeming with all sorts of life. A great introduction to Steinbeck, if you need encouragement to read his longer works."
negative,"No enough time.: Now I know why there's a difference in the price. This battery doesn't last for more than a few hours, no flash and using normally. Could be a back up of the back up while you charge any of the good ones. My advise; get the Panasonic one."
negative,"Manufacturer does not honor their warranty: It was a great mattress topper while it lasted. However, in less than five years of ownership I noticed the topper lost a considerable amount of firmness. It became too soft to sleep on except for the edges and I found myself waking up less refreshed. It's like trying to sleep on a 'V' shaped mattress.I contacted the manufacturer, Foamex, twice via email but they never responded. Finally I called and was told they won't service the mattress; redirecting me back to the seller who has since gone out of business. I have no experience with this seller, however I would suggest anyone considering purchasing a Sensus brand viscoelastic mattress or topper be aware that you will likely have problems before the ten-year warranty has expired. Plus, even if you find a seller who doesn't turn a warranty claim into a hassle, you will find they are rather expensive to repackage and ship. I will not purchase another Sensus or Reflex brand product."
positive,"Brief but Useful Introduction: I've used this book in the undergraduate Romanticism courses I teach, and found it quite useful. It is brief, brisk, and cleanly written, and serves as a good introduction to Byron. You won't find a lot of subtle insights into Byron's more obscure works here, but you will see how the life and the work converge and, at times, diverge. If you want to know more about Byron than you can find out from an anthology introduction, but don't want to plough through (or have your students plough through) one of the long biographies, this is the book for you. If you want geat detail and a full, scholarly treatment, you'll have to go elsewhere, though. Peters isn't catering to those needs."
negative,"Boring, although not as bad as A Painted House: In between the taut exciting thrillers Grisham used to wirte and the pointless drivel of A Painted House and Skipping Christmas. The first part was pretty good, not predictable at all, but then he just changed modes and starting droning on and on about boring small town life and didn't get back to the story until near the end. I long for the days of The Firm, A Time To Kill, The Partner, The Runaway Jury. Those were books I couldn't put down. It's been several years since Grisham's produced anything like that. This will be the last hardcover Grishal novel I buy--from now on, I wait for the paperback."
positive,"Both Conan's came in wide screen format....: I almost did not buy the 2 movie package because I saw the reviews stating that conan the destroyer is not in 16:9 ratio..Well for the price i bought it anyway since I wanted both movies.Both Conan's came in letter box wide screen format..Someone is confused..Both movies look pretty good on a 47"" widescreen HDTV. Shading is a little off, but every outdoor movie is off do to sunlight..My main point of this review is to tell people that do not waste your money on 2 seperate movies by the box set and you will be more then happy."
negative,"Plain DVD, Stupid Movie: This should not be named Halloween 3. They should have justleft that part off as it has NOTHING to do with the first two aboutMichael Meyers! As others have said before, it is poorly acted, no plot, and so annoying it might make you go insane! As far as DVD capabilities, there is nothing special (plain like the movie) about it. So, neither the movie nor the DVD make it a movie worth renting OR buying."
negative,predictable and ditzy: A predictable storyline with characters that seem dumb and ditzy...and a gaggle of friends (tries to copy the Sex and the city foursoume) that are have no depth! This is a book a girl does not want.
negative,"The so called 2 pack Louis De Funes: One of the packs contains movies that has very little of Louis De Funes in it, he acts in a very small capcity. Both packs are completely in French only with no subtitles of any other language at all. Very disappointed whereas virtually every other DVD do have subtitles. Advised to stay well clear unless one is fluent in French."
positive,SwaddleMe swaddler: I love this swaddler. Also used the fleece one for my son when he was newborn. He sleeps better than any of my other children did (I have 7) and I wish I would have bought one before. My son has only managed to wriggle out of this swaddler when I have failed to tuck him in properly. Most nights I wrap him in at around 9pm. He wakes at 2am for a feed and ALWAYS goes straight back to sleep. I unwrap him about 7am when he is nice and refreshed after a good sleep.A great product that I wish I had had for my other kids.
positive,"Expensive, but a great headset...: I use the headset with a Cisco 7960 - works great. I strongly recommend this product - excellent range and battery life.Too bad it's not possible to pickup/hangup without connecting a headset lifter (lame)."
negative,"Swadlers are MUCH better - these are anything but dry: My son is 4 months old and we've been using Pampers swaddlers pretty much since birth. We bought the Baby Dry size two when they were on sale and it's been a horror show ever since. 120 diapers and there has hardly been a day since when we haven't had to clean up an explosive diaper. My son is breast fed and he's not on solid food so a diaper labeled ""baby dry"" SHOULD have done the trick but instead it is un-absorbant and thus very leaky. Even if the diaper hasn't shot the poo up my baby's backside while he was playing then when I place him on the changing table, it is sure to do just that, creating a mess. My husband wants to throw the diapers out, I want to give them away but it almost seems cruel to give them to someone."
negative,"Only if you can learn from watching...: This was such a disappointment. Very little dialog or instruction. If you can learn just from watching the silent teacher, then you'd do ok. But I need someone to walk me through step by step and tell me the why and wherefore. Definitely not for beginners."
positive,"These have never leaked: We have 2 year old twin boys and sometimes it's just hard to grab them to change them. We have not had any problems with leakage, even overnight! Our boys sleep 12 hours and these diapers last! Plus they are very thin before being put on so you can stash a large number of them in a diaper bag. About 1/2 as thin as the Target brand and buy buying at Amazon with the reoccurring shipments they are cheaper (per diaper) than the Kirkland (Costco) brand."
negative,bulk packaging was waste: I generally order stuff from amazon and diapers and baby wipes are sure from amazon. This packaging was complete waste. Almost 50% of diapers that came had faulty belt. One of the sticker belts of the diapers wouldnt stick at all. Which caused more that 50% wastage.
positive,"Fun, Fun, Fun toy!!: This toy is great! It's sturdy, it's bright, the music isn't too annoying (there's two volume levels and on/off switch), and best of all the kids love it! Our one year old (who be bought it for) loves to push the clown's nose and make the music play.We did have some trouble changing the toy from the riding mode back to the walker mode, because the instructions skip one of the steps - pushing a button on the top - but, this wasn't a big deal as we figured it out on our own. We ended just leaving it in the riding mode, since that's what the kids liked best.This is a great toy - you won't be disappointed - it's as fun as it looks!"
negative,"Cornwell is losing his touch: Sad to say Cornwell is losing his touch. He's still trying to get as much money out of the ""Sharpe"" character as possible. To do this, he puts Sharpe in just about every battle of the Napoleanic Wars. If you've read the previous Sharpe books, or watched the films, you'll be disappointed with this book. There are even some rumors that Sharpe will see action at New Orleans in 1815 (Sharpe's 'Gator) which is a MAJOR stretch. What next Mr. Cornwell; Sharpe Goes to the Alamo ? If you MUST read this one, check it out at your local library, but I don't recommend buying it."
positive,Cinch: try price at Do It Best stores they deliver free to store near you price is $3.79 for 32 oz or $5.99 for 64 oz
positive,"the new 'worlds apart' WOW!!: This is one of the best albums of Saga, it reminds me of 'worlds apart'. My favorite songs :House of Cards, Runaway,Ashes to Ashes and Once in a lifetime.After the release of 'Pleasure & Pain' i thought my favorite group was going down the hill, but then they released 'Full Circle' in 1999 and was a big surprise since it was a return to their roots, now with this one its :WOW!!! there is not one song i dislike here. How come U2 or Dream Theater sell more than Saga? this is an example that the best doesnt always comes first, at least not here. Bravo SAGA!! THIS CD ROCKS!!"
negative,"Not the best: I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills."
positive,count on the classics: As always you can always count on the classics for a good read. Lord of the rings trilogy or any Tolkien novel can always be counted on for great entertainment.
positive,Works Great!: Worked great out of the box - - very accurate from what I can determine - I'm certainly happy with the product and the seller.
negative,"Cute but cheap and poorly made: I wanted some toy eggs for my daughter since we keep hens (for the eggs) and these looked cute. When they arrived though, there was mysterious dust (not just dust from shipping, it was silvery and smelled odd) in and on the carton and it had little plastic shavings coming off all over it that there was no way I would give it to my daughter to put in her mouth. These toy eggs are the epitome of cheaply made plastic goods so I returned this item and paid the few dollars more for the Tomy Hide n' Squeak Eggs, which are MUCH better."
positive,"Give the man SOME credit: Very briefly, to the pair of one-star reviews below, keep in mind that these stories were written in the 1940's! Must you blame Mr. Asimov for ""inaccuracy"" in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule? Well tough luck and go back to reading your Star Trek novels."
positive,"This is about a 2 traveling guys...: This book is very nice and it should be a full 5 stars with out a question, its a very interesting story about this retard (literally) who falls in love and gets in trouble while his friend has to always get him out of it...and it ends tragically...."
negative,"Self aggrandizing psycho-babble,: The book is poorly written with a lot of name dropping and gossipy insinuations. Into Thin Air, Climb, High Exposure are all better written and far more interesting. I think she figures if she refers to the ""mother goddess"" enough times she can pass the book off as feminist treatise. Lucky for Gammelgaard, she's a better climber than writer, or she'd be just be another fossil on the mountain. Don't waste your money."
negative,"Broke the first law of swing: I think that it is absurd that the Cherry Poppin Daddies feel the need to swear though out their album. Swing lyrics are supposed to be fun, light hearted, and make fun of the times both today and of yester-year. I wrote them off my swing list until they can clean up their act - it is a shame because they have a real tight horn section."
positive,"Great Book: This book is great, it is full of colorful pictures and stories that make history not only exciting for students, but also teachers."
positive,"The Stendhal Syndrome (2-Disc Special Edition): Blue Underground has done another great job with this horror / suspense movie director Argento.Great plot & suspense.The movie's main character is the beautiful and young policewoman Anna Manni (played by Dario Argento's daughter - Asia Argento) who is tracking down a violent serial killer and rapist (played by Thomas Kretschmann). Her track leads her to the Uffizi museum in Florence. There however, Anna is struck by the Stendhal Syndrome, which makes her faint, when among certain works of art, like paintings and statues. Her new handicap makes it very difficult for her to track down the killer,But she did finally found him .But i found the story a bit fantasy base but common since argento directs no comments.........long live Dario.........."
negative,Pass this up: This is easily one of the worst shows I have seen. With only 45mins to work with there is no character development and the monster designs and fight scenes are nothing special. The final battle is contrived and nothing is resolved. I'm a die-hard fan of anime and it was actually painful to watch this. I reget getting it. With all the good stuff out there pass this one up and get something else.
positive,Its good for the price: Its comfortable and easy to wear........For the price it is worth to get...I would recommend them to any ....
positive,Great Book: This book is really helpful for learning about color theory. Its technical but really interesting so you can get through it easily.
positive,Great Buy!: Wonderful book. I bought this for my husband and love the quality of the book.Bonus when buying this book: a red ribbon is attached to the binding to help keep your place as you read.
negative,"Pigs At The Trough: This is Ms. Stassinopoulus/Huffington's latest bid for attention, and I find it difficult to take her seriously as a writer or a politician. She changes her positions on an awful lot of issues depending on what seems to serve her own purposes - I get no sense that she is behind much of anything she says or writes."
positive,"Wow!: Excellent book! I didn't think I was going to be interested, but I couldn't put it down. All I did for three day was read The Other Boleyn Girl. I highly recommend this book."
positive,i love it: i love that song u got it bad i wish i had it i love it it makes me cry because i think of my ex-boyfriend
positive,"Spacey is AMAZING!: Great acting by both Spacey and Bridges. The plot flows very well. There are some logical holes in the story but I liked it so much, I was willing to over look them. This is definitely a movie a family should see on a Sunday afternoon."
negative,Avoid at all costs: Terrible sound quality coupled with an expensive price combine to make this phone an ill-advised purchase.
negative,"Bad Lifetime Movie: This book is like watching a bad lifetime movie. The author, Nicole Hunter, does not do a very good job of writing a believable male lead character. The main character, Tom Olsen, is a lonely middle aged basketball coach with nothing to do but wallow in his own pitty and fantasize about one of his students' mother. He makes remarks that only men in sappy movies make. If you don't understand what I am trying to say read the book, however, I don't recommend buying it. Pick it up at your local library. It shouldn't take longer than 20 minutes to get the gist."
positive,"An Astounding Story: I learned about the story of the Essex in researching my family history. Captain George Pollard, Matthew Joy and Owen Coffin are all distant relations. Philbrick does an excellent job taking the reader along on this fateful, dark journey. This is a grim, harrowing story and it's hard to read. However, I came away amazed and respectful of the courage these men demonstrated- especially the young Owen Coffin. I also appreciate Philbrick's sensitivity. When things get pretty dismal, Philbrick relieves the reader by interjecting educational explanations for what is happening and why. This book is a must read for anyone interested in Nantucket history, Moby Dick or inspirational stories of human courage and perseverance. The sea is not for the timid!"
positive,A good read on a rainy weekend: The Last Juror did not have the usual flair that Grisham's books have but still a nice read. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoyed A Painted House.
positive,Excellent Mystery With Plenty Of Laughs: This is the second book in this series that I've read and revisiting these colorful characters is like sinking into a big comfy chair. I like the way Ms. Taylor tells a story...it seems effortless (as it should). A very good mystery with plenty of twists and turns and a very satisfying conclusion. I don't understand why this author isn't getting more attention. She's gone to the top of my list.
positive,"Not just for plastic baggies!: I bought a bunch of snack taxi bags (they're great too - check them out!) for my daughters lunches. They're re-usable bags with cute designs on the outside and almost like tent material on the inside. I give them a quick hand-wash in the sink and hang them to dry on this great little dryer - it works out perfect! I used to go through the snack and sandwich sized baggies like mad, but between these two products I've definitely cut down on our plastic consumption and waste. An additional bonus is that because it's so easy, it's helped to motivate me to integrate more ""green"" practices into our home life and reduce our consumption and waste (yay!) When you're not using the dryer the wooden ring lifts up, bringing the wooden dowels together to make a narrow, compact unit you can easily stuff in a drawer or corner. I love it!"
positive,James West and Artemus Gordon meet Sherlock Holmes: This book seemed so different from the List of 7 it seemed like a seperate story as opposed to a sequel. The story flowed well but seemed to struggle at the end almost as if the ending was written for another book or by another author. I did enjoy the book and look forward to more from this author.
positive,"Good Lens Cap: This is a good lens cap and does meet the purpose. Personally, I wish it had a hole in it so it could be attached to the camera like the original lens cap that came with the camera."
negative,ludwig: Saw the 6-hour version at the SF Film Festival special screening about eight years or so ago. Was not bored for a minute. Why are we being offered the truncated version? Only 2 stars for this version which is very disappointing after having waited so long for a Region 1 release. Really a shame.
negative,"Too long, too general: This book does not live up to its title and subtitle. Very general material. For example, Denial of Service Attacks are in the news these days. Looking through the index, I find four references to DOS attacks. The first on page 45 tells me that DOS attacks can be costly. The second on page 85 describes some previous DOS attacks, including one that took place 12 years ago. The next reference is on page 304 and is a historical description of DOS attacks over the past three years. The last reference on page 452 tells me that I should conduct DOS testing for my web server. Most of the book's content is similar. If this is useful to you, please buy this book. For specific help in hardening your network, please look elsewhere."
negative,"Right Boot Defective: The right boot sole was defective, had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in. Return and refund procedure was painless. This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole."
positive,Romantic music: His voice has never changed. When he sings you want to listen. He is so sexy. HE PUTS ME IN A ROMANTIC MOOD.
negative,"Cheaply made: First time I tried the extractor, it busted off inside the bolt. Very hard metal, but so hard that it is quite brittle. Very little amount of free play, and doesn't let you put any torque on the bolt at all, so if it is rusted in there, forget about this set! Seems like a cheap knock off of the ever so popular ""easy out"" set.Now I have to figure a way out how to get the stupid thing out of my bolt so I can drill a new hole and tap some new threads in. Can't drill it out because the metal is so hard, it is chewing up my drill bits."
negative,"uhh..?: This book is so incredibly overrated its sickening. its mainstream tripe for the philistine reader of our age.But I give this 2 stars instead of one, only because I suppose it will be good treadmill exercise for the reader that doesn't read much and wants to make themselves feel literate."
positive,"WHERE IS IT?: WHERE IS IT? IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, FOR THIS GEM TO COME OUT ON DVD. THIS IS THE BEST SCORPS VIDEO THEY MADE! NOW THAT THEY ARE CALLING IT QUITS, THEIR VIDEOS ARE ALL WE WILL HAVE LEFT! WHATEVER COMPANY OWNS THE RIGHTS TO THIS,... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?"
positive,"You don't have to speak french to love this cd!: While visiting Quebec City, I heard her CD playing in a clothing store. I asked who the artist was, walked to the music store down the street and bought it. If you like Jewel, Tori Amos, Alanis Morisette, etc. you'll LOVE this. I'm now buying several more through amazon.com for my sister and a couple friends for X-mas because they heard my CD and LOVED it. Can't find it in any US stores...yet! It's mainly in French, but her voice and the music is so good, it doesn't matter."
positive,"Succeeds in intent & we sent the right folks up there: This beautiful looking and beatifully sounding film achieves its intent of capturing the feeling of the space flights of the 1960's. It was not meant to be a supplier of trivial information concerning pounds of thrust or specifications of spacecraft. This movie starts you out at at pre-launch, taking you through an amazing launch sequence, into orbit, off to the moon, around the moon and on it and then back to earth.Other than the visuals and the amazing Brien Eno soundtrack, what I like most are the commentaries by the astronauts. Listening to them, you understand that they realized the magnificence and importance of their journey. Whether NASA or the US government were flying people to the moon for Cold War sabre-rattling or not, the astronauts truly thought of their mission as one ""for all mankind."""
negative,The order was misapplied: You sent too many glasses which was not what I wanted. Thanks for your time. This is just to add words to the note.
positive,"THE BEST ALBUM OF '99: I cannot get this CD out of my player! Soulful, danceable, and often rocks as well. A complete listening experience. This is definitely the one album to own from the past year."
negative,"First and Last Book I'll Read by C. S. Lewis: I read this book on the recommendation of a Christian friend. I also read it because I've read and heard that C. S. Lewis is a great author. One more reason is that I was struggling with the concept of God. I am a Catholic.I guess I'm trying to say that I read it with an open mind, expecting to find insights and maybe some genuine knowledge.All I can say is my actual experience: This is the worst book I've ever read all the way through. (Which is, in a sense, faint praise. A lot of books have gone straight to the trash halfway through.)"
negative,"Too slow? Fast enough? Unreliable is more like it!: After reading some posts, I decided to see for myself how this card performed. I purchased two and put them to the test. I also like to use CF as a quick mini backup system using a usb reader. For reasons I can't explain, the first card would cause my whole system to pretty much freeze up. To double check if it was something else, I reproduced the problem 3 more times. I didn't think that would be likely but when I popped in my trusty Lexar, no prob!! So on to the second card. Guess what, no freezes, but the folks in the ""it's a slow card"" camp are right! Maybe the company just has a problem with their quality control division or maybe a bad batch got out or who knows? I just know I don't feel like saving a couple dollars is worth the headaches. Mine were returned. Good luck, though....."
negative,"Keep looking: This vacuum really never did what i thought it would do. I liked the price and the wind up cord, but this vacuum didn't pick up any dirt. It sucks, and doesn't pick up any dirt. It really hasn't worked in over a year, it never picks up dirt, and stinks. Its messy, and constantly getting clogged. Keep searching for another vacuume."
negative,"Works but not for long: This worked great for us for about 10 months. My son sharpens all the pencils in the house every Monday, so we only use it about twice a week in all. This morning it refused to work and upon close examination we discovered that the METAL gears had stripped! The plastic parts have held up fine.So, I'm back to the drawing board on what kind of pencil sharpener to get..."
positive,"Like Buffy!: This has often been compared to Buffy the Vampire Slayer.I know the first instinct is to say animated ""gore"" is stupid, but it's pulled of well as in 12 Kingdoms. The first volume episode does have one completely unnecessary scene where Yokho is naked and being seduced by a demon. Not sure why it's even in there! The rest of the series is normal and enjoyable. So, unless you happen to be a perverted young teenage boy or a desperate man, fast forward!!Yohko is even a magical girl, she's just...rougher, so girls should like this."
positive,Great Product: This was a life-saver when my 6-year-old router died the other day after a lightening storm. Amazon overnighted the router. I hooked it up and was quite shortly back in business. The product is well documented and easy to set up. Just make sure you understand and know what your ISP needs in the way of IDs and passwords and such.
negative,"Ewww.......: I also had the problem with the disintegrating cover (after 2 months of use), but got a free replacement from Combi, and it arrived within two days after calling to complain. Much better customer service than I would have guessed based on other reviews.My son was comfortable in this seat, it was nicely padded and had ample space. My one complaint was with loosening the strap. I actually had to dig around under the car seat cover and press down really hard to loosen the straps, despite the red stitching in the cover where it says to press. The cover is way too thick to pull that off.UPDATE: Replacement cover began to disintegrate within 2 days of arrival. Calls to combi customer service go unreturned. I replaced this with a Graco Snugride, and this seat went out with the trash. It's a messy, disgusting hassle that combi can't be bothered to fix correctly. Between the nasty seat cover and the flaky customer service, I wouldn't buy a Combi product again."
negative,"Disappointed...: I actually tried this stuff, and I can't really recommend it in good faith. It looks good in the bottle, but no cigar. It tasted like grocery pork and beans."
negative,Not a good movie. Not for children.: Not recommended for children and not even teenagers.Poor story.Nothing new or interesting.I was expecting something better.Dissapointed.
negative,"Nice Shots: I bought this DVD thinking it had a subject. Unfortunately it turned out to be a disappoinment. Nice shots of Miho Nomoto and Rebeca Chang are to view. No action, only nice poses of both."
negative,Film: My husband wanted to collect a copy of this film. The acting and the story is poor. Quality of the film is good.
positive,Kama Sutra Body Souffle Strawberry Creme: This is the perfect light weight skin creme that provides just the right amount of moisture with the wonderful fragrance of fresh strawberries!!!!
positive,"A Page in everybody's book of life: It's a literary masterpiece, realistic as it can be, Goodbye Columbus makes you feel as if you were 19 again. Neil's way of looking at life makes him a very interesting protagonist. For example the way he relates to the little black kid of the library. Roth really scored a hundred with this book, he makes the reader relates to the selfish feeling of a typical College student, like Brenda. It makes you laugh going into two different mentalities such as Neil's and Brenda's. What makes it the best is that at the end the reader can make his own conclusions about what happened in the story and why it is name like that."
negative,A Time Waste: Simply unreadable. A nonsense book and a ridiculous plot. Sincerely one of the worst books I've ever read.
negative,"No improvement on signal, actually lost a couple channels altogether: This RCA 10 dB amp did not work for me. I had it hooked up straight from an indoor antenna to a converter box. No long cable runs or signal splitter. With such a straightforward rig thought for sure I would see a signal boost. However, I ended up losing a couple channels like ABC and FOX. I also did not notice any signal improvement on channels that I did get. Bottom line, signal worked better without this amp in the circuit. It's a mystery to me why it didn't work."
positive,"Very Satisfied: The Chips were delivered right on time, and they very good. I like them very much. They are as expected. For the price paid they are very good."
negative,Lame: If you want quality buy MiddleMarch or Pride and Prejudice. This 11 hour saga bored me. Perhaps the tempo is better suited for novel form because I found the miniseries slow and painful. I also have gripes about steamrolling the plot into religion at the 11th hour and about resolving major conflict offscreen.The cast is stellar. The country is beautiful. It's everything else I don't like.
positive,Works very well: Planters warts on the feet are uncomfortable and difficult to treat. This wart stick makes it easy to apply the medicine exactly were you need it.
positive,"A good, though, romantic view of Isabella d'Este.: I am happy to know that this book is being reissued. I have been scouring bookstores for it for over a year. I used Cartwright's book extensively while I was working on an undergraduate thesis project on Isabella d'Este's patronage. The main pitfall of the book-which is by far the most complete ""portrait"" of Isabella d'Este-is Cartwright's own sentimentality. She creates a true Edwardian heroine of the Renaissance, however, she provides enough epistilary evidence to allow the reader to interpret for herself what Isabella was like. I have read a few books on Isabella, and each of them use the Marchesa for their own purposes. Isabella's unique position as a patron of the arts makes her a frequent target of lavish praise and damnation. In Cartwright's book, the reader is allowed to see a more complete picture of Isabella, although much work still needs to be done on the Marchesa in order to really understand her and her milieu."
positive,as advertised: Product came timely and was as advertised... usb 2.0 male connection on both ends. Quality is good and pricing was fantastic!
positive,"An unforgettable fable of good vs. evil: This story is one that I have thought of often in the 15-plus years since I first read it. It is a tale of moral dilemma and tests of loyalty. There is enough of the macabre to keep the reader tightly gripped, yet enough moral fiber to keep the reader thinking for years to come... and isn't that the true test of great literature?"
negative,The Hobbit: the movie is of very poor quality. My daughter wanted to share a favorite movie from her childhood with her own boys. very disappointed.
positive,"Almost Perfect: The ONLY reason this device doesn't get 5 starts from me, is that although you can set the specific temperature you want the water to be heated to -- it won't go under 187 degrees (which is still WAY hot for my kids). Now, my kids aren't big coffee drinkers (3, 7 and 11), but they love the cocoa, apple cider and herbal teas. If you could set the temperature say, down to 150 or 160 degrees, it would be perfect! Otherwise, LOVE it!"
negative,"Failed expectations: I have some acne scars around my face and I was hoping that this product would provide any assistance with it.It in fact did nothing to the appearance and through the weeks that I used it, I started to even break out in acne. I had more acne appearing on my skin than the months preceding this product. Completely disappointed but what can I expect from products in America"
positive,"Instant results, instant pain!: I have sensitive teeth so I expected to have some of the symptoms described in the reviews, but WOW ... I didn't know what I was in for. I would describe the the pain as sharp zaps that come and go. It is unlike any other tooth pain I've ever experienced, and I can see why some people would stop after their first encounter with this pain. I decided to stick it out anyway, and I'm glad I did. I saw results instantly, and by the last day my smile was perfect. A tip for anyone with sensitive teeth: clenching my jaw or rubbing the gum area directly below the affected teeth helped with the severity of the pain."
negative,"The Horrorist Blows: I think this song sucks. It's such a waste of money. The beat is a total yawner and the story's lame, too. Is this supposed to be scary or something? Well, it's not. I don't get why older kids think the Horrorist is freaky or scary, because to me he just seems like a boring guy who makes boring songs that sound just like tons of other songs."
positive,"Fantastic Cast!: I was reluctant to go plop down money to see this movie, having heard that is was exactly like the numerous African American movies that have hit theaters over the past several years. After all too much of a good thing can be a turn off. However, after deciding that it was easier to just go see it instead of continuing to wonder about it, I took in a Sunday matinee.For the duration of the film, I was grinning, shaking my head, and sometimes ever laughing out loud. Vivica Fox has never been a favorite of mine but I have to give it to her: she played the role of Chante extremely well. The supporting cast (the main reason I finally went to see it) were outstanding as well.Doug McHenry has made a career out of producing and directing witty, entertaining films. Great job once again."
negative,"Too Fragile for Any Use Other then Display: This was a great deal at under ten bucks and the set is very pretty. I photograph drinks for a website so this was perfect for presentation. The first glass broke from a very light TAP to the bottom when I placed it in the sink. The second glass to break - BROKE ALL BY ITSELF (SHOCK!). I had just finished washing the dishes (by hand) and went into another room. About 5 minutes later I heard a POP and the rim of one of the martini glasses popped right off in a complete circle. I have no idea how the third glass broke - when I picked it up the rim of the glass was separated. I will use the rest for photos, but this is NOT a durable set and would be a real disaster to serve guests, especially if they are wearing nice clothes."
negative,"I am yet to receive this book, first time I ever had a problem: I am disappointed that the book has not yet come. I have always used Amazon and never had a problem before. I assume the seller is to blame. My calls have produced no results"
positive,I see so many stars: I have to say his music's so touching. He played all the songs in a sensative smooth and romantic way which just perfectly fit my taste. At the back of the cover there's a photo shows when he's playing. No wonder he could play such beautiful songs because he's so into the music himself. Every note he made like rain drops fall in my fancy. Every song are so good that you want to litsen to them repeatingly. Among them Danny Boy is my best choice. I love the melody and love his way to play it. Get this cd even just for Danny Boy. You won't be disappointed if you like some lyrical tender tunes. What a jazz round midnight! it really is...
positive,"A great gem of Christian music: Delerious is a band who has done much to give Christian music intelligence, integrity and fun. With so many bands that try to be derivatives of other bands, Delerious has benn who they want to be, and done so very well.With King of Fools, they have delivered very well. Deeper speaks to the sould, the yearning to be better, but that we can be nothing without Christ. Sanctify is a Psalmic cry for help from God. White Ribbon Day asks how there can be God in an evil world, yet does not give up on continually callingon His name. These songs are honest and they are real. Moreover, they have a musical quality to them that exudes passion and love.Smith's voice is reminiscent of U2's Bono, but at the same time with a style of his own that gives feeling to Delerious' well written words."
negative,"Really just so-so: I've watched this movie twice, and I am not sure I will watch it again.First of all, I'm one who had never had anything bad to say about Madonna's acting, but here she's really bad. She gets better and the movie progresses, it's almost distracting, because she's supposed to be the center of the attention.Rupert Everett is fine, he looks dashing of course, like Benjamin Bratt.But then, the movie itself is really badly done. They had the locations, the sets, and yet it's just not at all good and almost boring at times, not to mention the familiar places we've been at before and the really annoying court scenes. Just how many times do we have to see attorneys trashing innocent people?Honestly, there is nothing new in this movie to make it worth watching more than once to convince yourself how not good it is."
negative,"Thought it would filter smelly water...I was wrong: I am guessing this would work perfectly with heavily chlorinated water, such as city water because it definitely did NOT help filter any of the sulfur smell from my well water. It also did not filter any of the iron oxides because after a month the white color where the water comes out is now orange. Also immediately after I put it in the silver holder where the actual shower head fits in broke, it's plastic which seems stupid considering it is a hand held shower head which would cause you to remove it multiple times through out it's shower head life....wouldn't you want that material to be durable???? Not a good buy for me, I was very displeased with this item, if your product states it would help with sulfur and iron then you better make sure thats what it does...."
positive,I am pleased with the performance of this saucepan.: I recommend this 3 quart saucepan; it is a well constructed saucepan which will provide good service for a long time to come. I bought this saucepan to replace my other one (same saucepan)that lasted over 20 years.
negative,"Crashing: IBM's Hard drives have been failing on customers, causing all of their data to be lost. Not good. My friend had his entire hard drive just fail on him the other day, it was an IBM. I would not reccommend their Hard Drives."
negative,"please bypass this camera!!: save your money or give it to your better half.this is a point and crap unit.if there is any light in the back ground the picture gets washed out,which is most.using your flash also washes out the picture.eats battery like crazy .nice size and great operation program.that is the only good thing i can say about this camera.very poor light control.selling this unit has got to hurt the companys image in my opinion."
positive,"Nobel House: It is a great book, need to read Tia Pan first. Great history of Hong Kong. This is my second time that I have read this book. Would love to hear others comment."
negative,used?: received battery and gave it a full charge as if new. The charge only lasted for about 4-6 hours. Contacted amazon and they sent another one. The new one only lasted for about a few hours longer. Wasn't very happy with the product but the phone was only temporary. Definitely not a good battery for the long term.
negative,"And now for something not so different after all: I overcame my reservations about this movie because, well, it has Alan Arkin. He's funny, right?Well not in this thing, though you can tell that he's trying, but he's dealing with lousy direction, a horrible script, and he's trying to play a character that has been definitively played by one of the comic geniuses of the century.The plot, as feeble as can be expected for the genre, would actually have some interesting potential if it could have exploited today's digital technology. Imagine a dozen Clouseau's bumping into each other as they all accidentally rob the same bank.I haven't seen the other Clouseau flicks recently enough to remember if they all were like this, but this G-rated flick had enough gay innuendo to almost consider that this was brilliantly hidden subversive material. Somehow, though, I doubt it."
positive,"Great read.: Dexter's mysteries are so well written, whatever I read next suffers in comparison. I love the word play. The chapter intro quotes are also very clever."
negative,"Less than satisfying enlargement: I purchased this product to enhance my physique. Specifically, the nethers. I applied it just as it said on the label, ""rub judiciously to area desired to enlarge"". and I waited. And waited. And waited. The best effect I received was a warm glowing that my girlfriend found unnerving, though illuminating. Overall, this product did not work as well as the pumps or pills that I buy from spam emails. Would not buy this product again unless my Geiger counter needs to be calibrated. which it never does. because i don't own one."
negative,"Defective edition: I've enjoyed reading this edition for its critical essays and helpful footnotes, but the copy I ordered from Amazon was missing thirty pages. (It turns out that pages 14 through 44 are printed twice, resuming at page 77). They may have corrected the problem in other copies, but don't assume that you'll get the whole book!"
negative,junk SENT Back: Poor Speaker Hook up thin wires only spealker nut for main speaker thin wire push pins for surround.2. No co-ax hook up for ant if you neek a Terk power antenna no way. Fm reception poor.3. Dumb hard to use manualI sent mine back and for a few bucks more bought a decent Sony.
negative,"SAVE ME FROM IRON SAVIOR !!!: God, another European power / melodic metal band !!! THis one had a good start, possessing Kai Hansen along their ranks. So I went for it !! What a deception!!! It's so repetitive, boring, dumb. If you like real metal, I can say these guy tried to do it, but failed miserably !!"
negative,"Do NOT Read This Book!!!: This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion! OK, I'm in the minority. Most of the reviewers LOVED the book. I think this book is a waste of beautiful words! Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary. But, the ""story"" is ""encrusted"" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did, ""What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."" You won't feel ""alone"" in your reaction. I think ""Heart of Darkness"" is a much better book. Comments? boland7214@aol.PS: As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO ""yes"" votes for my review. That's ""mean"". I'm just giving my honest reaction. You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone. Thanks."
negative,"pretty, but boring: My 5 month old did not like this product. She could turn it on and off right away, but lost interest in 2 minutes. It definitely sounds like an aquarium. I did not like the music. I do like the water sounds, I just wish there was an all night option. That is the only way my baby sleeps. I also don't like the fact that if you change modes (there are 3) you have to reset the sound you want, i.e. crashing waves. Any time you switch modes it automatically goes to the 1st song, which I can't stand. I don't feel it is worth the money."
negative,"NetGear: unreliable, bad support & performance: I've owned a variety of NetGear units over the last five years, mostly stuff given to me, bought cheaply at sell-outs, and left over from dot-bomb company crashes.I keep using them because I have four of the same units I didn't pay for, and I only have three connections hooked to them. I gave up dealing w/their support years ago.Once or twice a year the unit and/or the power supply burns out, and I recycle the unit at a local company. When I run out of units or power supplies, I'll be done with NetGear and will avoid them completely in the future.The Linksys router I have sitting next to it is four years old and still running without any downtime."
negative,"Not made for my baby's sensitive bottom!: I decided to make the change to pampers based on all the positive reviews from customers. It was a bad decision for my baby! It gave my poor baby a really bad diaper rash from the chemical in the baby dry! Maybe good diapers for others, but definitely not for my baby. I will be sticking with Huggies!"
negative,"What a disappointment.: I have to say that when we got the advance copy of Dreamcatcher in the bookstore where I work, I could hardly wait to read it. I was truly excited that King was finally returning to his roots and his fans with supernatural horror, always his strong point. The size of the book didn't daunt me--I thought it would be 700 pages of greatness! Color me WRONG. I tried to like the book. I kept reading long after I lost interest and emotional involvement. But in the end, I had to quit 200 pages short of the end. I don't know how this book ends, so I can't ruin it for you. But I have to warn you--I don't CARE how this book ends. If you're a die-hard King fan, wait till it comes out in paperback, then it might be worth your money. But for now, just wait. And don't get too excited over it."
negative,"Stay away from U3: My flash drive stopped working after I plugged it on a Windows Vista machine. After that, I couldn't even format it. I had to install and uninstall U3 three times to (luckly!) revive it. This drive now is in probation mode until I can trust on it again to keep important data.Just google ""u3 cruzer format problem"" and you'll understand the problem."
negative,Flat and Amateur: She's a bitch. He's a creep that attacks her during their first training session. The character personalities are one-dimensionally developed to have the depth of a piece of paper. Hard to like either one of them and even care about their story.
negative,RIP OFF: Could'nt wait for a new book to come out imagine my surprise when i opened this book and saw it was a rerelease of long tall texans 3 so if you want to read this book go to the library and pick up long tall texans 3 dont waste your money buying men of the west
positive,"The author's name is Francis T. Gignac, price is 8.95+: Not really a review, just an error I noticed by accident. They have 1000 copies of this book in stock."
negative,"My first young readers book: I found the book interesting. However, tapping on the screen continually so that I could read the print and then tapping again to see the illustrations was very annoying. Also there is a page in the middle where the sentence doesn't end but the next page begins a whole new sentence."
positive,VIG is Dope: Violence Is Golden has such a dope variety of tracks. This cd totally has the juice. Every track tells a different story in such a way I felt like I was part of the song. I think every hip-hop head needs to get this.
positive,"Excellent signal: A few points I'd like to share:1. Excellent reception - I'm using Linksys router with DD-WRT firmware and this card picks up consistant 5-bar signal. I've previously had Buffalo Airstation WLI2PCIG54S in the same machine and it only had around 2-bar of signal strength (same location.)2. Antena cable is about long enough to put it on top of a midsize tower.3. I run RaLink (for chipset RT61) on XP machine instead of the MSI supplied driver, also configured thru Window wireless option. So far, it's been stable, no drop signal.For price/performance ratio, I think this is a great choice."
negative,"Junk: The idea is great. The implementation is terrible.To start with, the remote shouldn't really be called a remote since you have to be within 5 feet for it to work. It doesn't play correctly. The software that you have to run on your computer is clumsy. Everything about this product is wrong.This thing is a total piece of [...]. D-Link normally produces nice products but they completely missed with this one."
positive,"Good album: I like this album a lot. There's a lot of power and swirling guitars, and the melodies just knock you flat. Enigk's soaring tenor is at its most tremendous here. Every Shining Time you Arrive is a classic, and #9, the title of which contains a dirty word, has one of the most beautiful and jarring transitions I've heard in years. Great CD.On another note, I think it's funny that a previous reviewer, Heidikakis from NY, lifted almost all of her(his?) review from pitchforkmedia.com...Why would someone do that? I'm sure that the folk at pitchforkmedia.com aren't pleased."
positive,"So many Buendias: This book was everything it is billed to be. I picked it up as a ""classic to read over the summer"". This is one of the better choices I've made in this annual quest. Although I must admit to getting very lost at times trying to keep all of the Jose's, Ursula's and others straight. I often found myself re-reading chapters to figure out exactly who was involved! That said, the re-reading was not unpleasant, as it can often be when you get lost.This is a book that you should add to your ""things to read to remain well-rounded"" list (just make sure you have plenty of time - this is not a quick read.)"
negative,"More like ""A Simple Mind's Mirror"": Really Bad. Embarrassingly bad. In fact, this book is so bad that I don't want to dignify it further by saying any more than that.On the other hand, if clarifying and delving deeper into Neil Peart's prosaic and allegorical lyrics is of interest to you, then I strongly recommend ""Mystic Rhythms: The Philosophical Vision of Rush"" by Carol Selby Price and Robert M. Price (5 stars)."
positive,"Great, uplifting trance: Confirming what most of the previous reviews have reported..this 2 disc set really is a great mix by Above/Beyond with lots of uplifting tunes, beats, and melodies. I would go as far as saying that there are no bad tracks on this entire mix. If you're a fan of trance, anything by AvB or PvD, or are looking to get into trance, I would suggest this Volume 5 mixed by Above and Beyond."
positive,"paula brings it.....: paula pours her heart and soul into this fun,high energy extravaganza.it's more than just your run of the mill concert,all the elements are there.great songs,a tight band,energetic dancers and of course amazing choreography.if you're not a paula abdul fan, you will be one after you watch this."
positive,"A really funny and adventerous romp!: I expected ""The Mummy"" to be another greasy, melo dramatic action flick. When my sister FINALLY convinced me to watch the movie, I found it to be really funny, visually pleasing and well acted! I was pleasantly surprised to find John Hannah, from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Sliding Doors"", as Evie's brother, Jonathon. His part as well as Brendan Frasier's part was hilarious and well written. The Egyptian setting and subject matter gave the movie a sense of mystery and antiquity you don't usually get in action movies. Watch this movie for the humor and you will not be disappointed! For all of those who like action this is also a great pick. The special effects are really stunning and, while this is a period piece, the action sequences are exciting. Personally, not being a fan of action, I enjoyed this movie more because of the plot (which isn't as cheesy as it could've been,) the setting, the actors and the humor!"
positive,"Fabulous product!: I would buy this product over and over again. I absolutely love it! Great fragrance and goes on smoothly. Lasts all day! Excellent product. I would recommend this product to all my friends and family.All Natural Frankincense & Myrrh Aromatherapy Oil - Zum Massage & Body Oil by Indigo Wild, 4oz."
negative,"poorly written nonsense: The author apparently has some theory relating to unexplained phenomena, but you'll never figure out what it is from reading this book. He strings together repetitive descriptions of ""unexplained"" events, without coherent narrative or structure.The book is filled with ludicrous claims about what ""scientists know"" or ""studies have shown."" Of course there's no support for the claims.Don't waste your time on this book."
negative,"higgins disappoints: This is without a doubt Higgins' least inspired work in years. The plot is predictable and over worn, and the books is very uninspired. A real disappointment"
positive,Great songs to sing to: I forgot how enjoyable it was to sing to these songs since you don't hear them on the radio anymore. I do miss the old scratchy sound since they really adjusted the quality of the songs. My mind still remembers the way they used to sound. I like the photo booklet that comes with the CD and the cute little movie of the Beatles that appeared on my computer when I inserted the CD. Very nice!
positive,"THE BEST SALSA: THE BEST SAUCE YOU COULD EVER PUT ON YOUR TABLE AND USE ON YOUR COOKING ON JUST ABOUT ANYTHING, BRINGS THE COSTARICAN SPIRIT ON YOUR MEALS!"
negative,"Disappointment: Having seen the play, and loving the colorful, musical presentation of Joseph's story, I was disappointed to see the movie cheapening the theatre experience. The ""narrator"" is a modern woman who doesn't blend into the story at all, but is present in almost everything. The audience of children are included in the movie which also detracts from the play itself. The performers are talented and accomplished, but the above distractions ruined the experience for me."
negative,"1634: The Ram Rebellion: Very, very disappointing. I loved 1632, liked 1633, was luke warm over the Gallileo book, and really disliked this one. Sad to see a great idea/series start go downhill so fast. The ""humor"" in this book is mildly ammusing for the first 10 pages or so then increasing sophmoric and boring for the next 50 pages. I scanned the last 50 pages and then ash canned this turkey. Save your money. I hope ""CAnnon Law"" returns to the quality of the first book, but the blurb on it is not promising. Most readers, like me, don't really care how many angels can dance on the head of a 17th century pin and get really bored with endless minutia about religious arguments. Wake up Eric and give us some fun, rousing tales of survival, war, and innovation in the unique ""world"" you created in 1632."
positive,Get the tape: I loved this book although I admit that I was confused a lot while reading it. I choose it for my book club and purchased an audio tape - I think I got it from amazon.com - that really helped me make sense of it. Everybody in my club hated it-several were forced to read it in college and didn't want to read it again. I was captivated by the magical realism and the idea of the perpetual cycle of life. I'm surprised Oprah selected it - it is really difficult. I also read Love in the Time of Cholera and thought it was much easier to read. Marquez is an author everyone who loves reading should attempt. If you can just stop insisting on instant gratification and keep on reading even it it doesn't make sense and even if you can't keep track of all the characters-just keep on reading and let the story get into your blood. It truly is magical.
negative,Brain numbing: Strange analogy on death. I tried to go find good in this rambling read but non exist. No need to bother.
positive,"Great Documentary: Really great film for anyone interested in the Shulgin's work. In addition to Dr. Shulgin there is also a good bit of information on & interviews with a number of other researchers in this field. I feel like it may be geared more towards those that only know a little bit about Sasha & his work, but enjoyable for those more knowledgeable as well. My only complaint is that there weren't any deleted scenes or extended interviews in the DVD special features. Enjoy!"
negative,"WORD OF WARNING TO NEW METHENY LISTENERS: If you're new to Pat Metheny, Bright Size Life is NOT the one you want to buy. I think it's his first work, and it basically sounds like any Jazz trio you may find in a college ensemble. CD's like Letter From Home (my favorite), Offramp, Secret Story, First Circle, and Still Life Talking have the outstanding and unique sound that made Pat a superstar.There was not even 1 song on this CD that I could add to my Metheny MP3 collection. Not even close. I wasted my money. I usually only do positive reviews on Amazon, but I got so tired of seeing Bright Size Life so high up in the Pat Metheny sales rankings that I just wanted to warn people."
negative,"Over Priced: Despite being a very well writen work, this ebook is over priced for the length and content. I have a paper copy sitting next to me, and even it is less expensive! I am disappointed."
positive,Great Info: Likes how the tradition of Halloween came about & what different things mean and represent.The best part is the recipes. That are quick & easy to make.
negative,"terrible for dragonlance - good for children: This was, by far, the worst dragonlance book i ever read. The language if very poor - suitable for children at best. It seems as if the story was just made up as it was written. Very random events. Keeps reiterating and using the same terms over and over again. Not very logical, even for a fantasy - just plain silly... Read it as a comedy perhaps, but if you want a serious indulging read, forget this book - terrible, terrible, terrible.If books like this can be successful, it makes me belive I could be a sucessful writer."
positive,"very good: OK ""fan"" from tx- you obviously have no clue of what you are talking about. First of all, the Muffs just DID have a break through record with Alert Today Alive Tomorrow. They released this cd so there dedicated fans unlike yourself would have a chance to here all of there lost material. Get the facts before you say anything you don't have a clue about. Anyway this cd isn't for someone who is just getting into the muffs but any fan should get it right away. Even if your not a fan it has many good songs but there are also some mediocre ones. All in all- very good"
positive,Mosby's Medical Dictionary 7th Ed: I am glad I bought this one to cross reference and for more thorough definition for my med term course; it got lots of vivid pictures which I even like. I highly recommend this book.
positive,"One of the best YA books: Diane Duane writes great YA books. She wrote about wizards before Harry Potter! Buy more of her books, you will enjoy them."
positive,"overall pretty good: The poster is overall pretty good, but the colors are not as vivid as they are on the computer. Its still a beautiful picture though and its a really good size."
positive,"it's good: wow, i really didnt understand what all the fuss was about until i read this book. the characters are so real and tangable, but they exist in this strange and mysterious world. it will probably be the best book i will ever read."
positive,"Great book.: You would be surprised, you probably already know someone in your office that fits this perfectly, it can give you great insight in how to work with them."
positive,"Terrific extras and excellent quality: This is the movie I'm never tired of watching. The special features are so numerous there's a whole disk dedicated to them. Making of, deleted footage, montage of extra footage, documentary on the history of gladiatoral combat, and much more make this purchase worth it. Excellent quality and in wonderful widescreen format not found on the VHS."
positive,"Strength and Honor!: An outstanding portrayal of the barbaric customs of the Romans! From the opening battle scene to the climactic duel in the end, you're on the edge of your seat! Nonstop intense action and excellent acting make this movie a top-5 for me and my dad.A clear line is shown between just plain revenge and duty to country- going along with a dethroned General's motto: strength and honor. A classic, good guy vs. bad guy movie where the protagonist is someone to look up to, someone with leadership qualities.A hand also for Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, who did the score for this film! Bravisimo!"
negative,"Why?: With all the different scholastic reading options out there, why is this book still on our kids reading lists? I read it thirty years ago and recently read it again because my kids had too. The language is archaic. The imagery is impossible to grasp. And the subject matter is macabre, not that I have a big issue with that but lets move on already. If it was nonfiction like IN COLD BLOOD then at least I might see some value in it as a human interest story worthy of not forgetting."
positive,"Another great book on picking up women.: This book should be added to your collection.There is a lot of advice here that isnt mentioned in other books and offers us guys more information we need to know.Its about time that women had to make an effort too.I learned a lot from this book.I highly recommend it to all guys.You can find more of these types of books.Search here under ""dating"",""how to pick up girls"" and ""how to pick up women"" on this site."
positive,"Klaatu: It was a replacement for the one that was ""stolen"" by my now ""ex"" about ten years ago...The replacememt was in excellent condition and it was just as good (or even better) than the one that was taken...Klaatu was a innnovative band...It's a shamethey didn't catch on well here.."
negative,"Leave out the swearing please!!!!!: This book would have been ten times better (and half as long) if she had stuck to her cooking experiences. I could completely do without her foul mouth and her completely unrelated rantings about politics and sex. This book had great potential, but doesn't deliver. I fervently hope the movie version takes out the garbage and only keeps the good stuff."
positive,"TOP NOTCH!: So far the first one was the absolute best! They all are good, but the first has more detail and always makes you want to read to the end. Then when you read to the end, you just have to get the next book to find out more. This book is incredibly interesting and begins the Wizarding series with a magnificent start!"
positive,"Paolini Power: I loved this new novel. I couldn't put it down!Buy this book if you haven't already, because you are missing out!Long Live Eragon!"
positive,"Excellent read...: I loved Men at Work, a George Will book that covered LaRussa, and I loved reading Friday Night Lights by Bissinger. This book was exactly what I hoped it would be, a perfect combination of LaRussa's wit placed poetically into psalm by Bissinger's pen.A must read!"
negative,Bloated with a few good ideas presented: This definitely feels to me like there were a few good ideas puffed up with lots of words and air to make a longer book. Anyone who needs this info doesn't need all that storytelling and wants the info in the most effective form not in some long drawn-out storyline. It also feels like it was a set-up for more books at big prices to present info that could have been presented effectively in one book. I am very glad I got this out of my local library instead of buying it!
positive,Exactly what i wanted: This book came in excellent condition and arrived on time. it was more than i expected and just what i could hope for. i am very glad i purchased this.
negative,"Not good: I didn't find this book at all interesting.. all though there was occasional humor.. in general, i didn't enjoy this piece of literature."
negative,"made me sick: I was so hoping to love this product after reading some of the good reviews, however, these made me so nauseous and sick. i don't think i can ever drink tea again because of how sick these made me feel. It might have just been a reaction to my system, and my system only....but i'm throwing my box away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :o("
positive,"Delicious Electronics...: I had purchased Cirrus' second album first (Back on a Mission) and it really appealed to a broad electronic audience, but Drop the Break is probably more for pure ""electronic heads."" This album is mostly big beat songs with electronic remixes and some interesting live elements. However, amidst all the big beat and electronic songs, 'October 27' stands out as a truly beautiful slow-er song. It almost reminds me of some of BT's work. I hope I never get tired of hearing that track.The big picture: The Cirrus boys have alot of talent and if you like their music stlyes or big beat/dance/electronic music then this is a must have for your collection. Happy Gooves...."
negative,"""The Art of MISunderstanding Your Mate""....: This book, originally published in the early 70s, is WAY outdated. Osborne maintains (I am not far from quoting) that unless a woman gets married, gets pregnant, and has a bunch of kids she will never be satisfied. A woman's place is in the home, a man's is at the office, and apparently realizing this is supposed to let you and your mate in on your true identities and lead to blissful lives. Furthermore (and perhaps worse), Osborne insists on stereotyping males and females in ways that were very offensive to both me and my husband. Example: women like to fight to test whether their husband will dominate them, because in the end they like to be dominated. The further we read, the more disgusted we became. Unless you live on some other planet or possibly in some other time period, this book will only lead to MISunderstanding each other. Don't waste your money."
negative,What a bore!: I love a good horror book & this was not it. This was a total waste of time. I had to force myself to finish it only so I would know what people are talking about. A book has to be really bad for me not to finish it. I found it really stupid with all the belching & flatulance although I imagine teens will really like that part of it.
negative,"Sorry: Instead of watching this video, go to the library and read a list of the Kings and Queens. You will receive the same information, almost. The information in the library will more than likely be correct."
positive,"Captivating book, end falls a bit short: A great read. I'm not big on novels, but found I could not put this book down and was looking forward to my read each day on the way home from work.Only complaints - a few ends not tied up properly, end just ended, Ruben and Ginger's relationship quite weak.A good read, well recommended !"
negative,"interesting overview of siege warfare-but no Braveheart!: This movie has 1 redeming quality-it introdues the modernviewer to the art of war, especially the devestation brought aboutduring a siege. I liked the way the movie took you through all the different phases of a battle; the rallying of the troops, the pre-fighting taunting, the use of siege towers, etc.. What amazed me is how much this movie stole from Braveheart. The scenes involving Joan addressing the troops before the charge and the boiling oil falling on the helpless battering ram chargers made me think I put the wrong tape in."
negative,"Boredom personified!: This movie, supposedly a journey into terror, lulls one off to sleep most of the time. The pace is so slow that I thought the exposition would never end. There wasn't one fear producing moment in the entire movie. I believe ""Bambi"" was scarier.This movie is dreadful, especially when one remembers the 1963 version with Julie Harris. I wonder how much money was spent making this dud!"
negative,"Capable of doing better!: Stephen King is one of my top five favorite contemporary writers (along with John Irving, Richard Russo, Neil Gaiman, and Bruce Alexander, in case you're interested.) However, Dreamcatcher is one of my least favorite Stephen King novels. There are traces of the things that have made me a devoted SK reader, but they are scarce. Perhaps the best part of the novel is the character Duddits and the role he plays. A major weakness is the impression that much of the novel seemed to be written with Hollywood in mind. And while we have all reluctantly learned to expect grossness in SK novels, Dreamcatcher carries it to new extremes, and seriously hindered my ability to enjoy the novel. Don't expect anything approaching the greatness of The Stand or It or The Dark Tower series."
positive,"A different approach.: Kingsley interprets the writings of Parmenides and Empedocles in a different way than the usual mainstream traditions. Easy to follow and understand without all the intellectual jargon, also very enriching. I enjoyed this book and think it deserves the 5 stars. Some philosophers will disagree with his handling of the texts and interpretations but he shines a new light on a tradition that has otherwise been stagnating, and one that is refusing to accept new fresh ideas or theories. I would qualify him as a ""modern"" philosopher and his writings as ""modern"" philosophy. A definite read for all those with broad minds and horizons."
positive,"Wonderful book: This is the wonderfully engaging tale of how Bugliosi successfully prosecuted the Manson Family for the August 1969 murders. However, if you wish to learn a lot about the backgrounds of the ""family"" members, this is not the book for you. This book is from a law-enforcement point of view. If you pick up this book hoping to learn about Manson and his philosophy, you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to know how the players were implicated and prosecuted, there's no better book."
negative,"Sloooooooooooooooooow: Am I the only one who found this movie to be VERY slow and much too long? People talk about ""Gladiator"" like it's some slam bang action picture. The trailer sure made it look like one, yet everything in the trailer came from the last third of the film. Every scene in the first half of the movie is so protracted I had to stop myself from yelling, ""GET HIM IN THE COLISEUM ALREADY!"" The film is well structured and a good story but there's not enough meat on this bone for a film well over two hours. And so it feels s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d with pretty visuals, pretension and unnecessary talk-talk-talk. If we could get a 90 minute cut of this on the DVD set, I'd buy and treasure it. Until then, I'll keep watching ""Braveheart."""
positive,"My son loves it!!!: I don't know much about this toy, but my son has enjoyed it very much. He has speech impairement and that was the reason I choose this toy."
positive,"best album in years !!!!: I hadn't purchase a cd in years , this one is so worth it , the music, the voice, everything is so much more than i expected. I can't wait for the next one !"
positive,"Awesome: Love this group...Love this song by this group...became a big fan of theirs, everything on the album is great and they have a few songs that are really awesome, this is one."
negative,Watery Defect....: I am now on my 2nd B70 at home and I have a 3rd at my office. For those who have posted that the coffee tastes watery and bland your unit is defective. The 1st one I brought home made watery coffee that tasted like bad airline coffee. We called Keurig and they said return it for an exchange. I did and the new one one made (notice past tense) great coffee and now after a month it is making watery coffee. Why I don't know seems like a pretty basic operation. The one at my office works fine.Obviously there is a defect that causes the unit to make watery coffee. So if your unit isn't making delicious coffee and tea the unit is bad. Doesn't say much for the build quality on this model.
positive,"This is good!: This is ""happy music"". I play this more than all the other Mannheim C.D.s that I've collected. Great sound!"
negative,"Mity-Mite has all the power of a flea: Bought one of these to jump start my 3.6 litre 911. It doesnt have the power to even turn it over once when fully charged. Complete waste of time, maybe it will start a lawn mower."
negative,"Night Time Disaster Since We Read Froggy: In this book which our child loves, Froggy FINALLY brushes his teeth...and then...get this....he eats a bowl of flies AFTERhe brushes his teeth. Now our child wants a bowl of cereal AFTER he brushes every night! THANKS A LOT! Boo to the author."
negative,Office Space - Secial Edition with Flair (Full Screen Edition): What a waste of time and money. Stupid and not very funny. I gave this as a Christmas present to a friend and was totally embarrassed after we watched it together!
positive,"Small flaw in an otherwise nice product: My friend, who is a chef, helped me pick out this product. Since I have an electric stove, the extra weight and thickness of the pot was reocmmended over a cheaper alternative. The extra weight/thickness helps prevent food from sticking (does not stick or burn from uneven/too much heat) and it washes easily.The only drawback to the pot is the handles. Other pots and pans have heavier plastic than this particular model, and the heat does transfer slightly more into the handles because of it. It won't lead to a burn like a metla handle, but this is the only weak point of its custruction."
negative,"Oh so disappointed: I bought this release based on the merits of the two singles which made the airwaves. When I first heard them I was psyched that here was a band with a great new sound that was powerful, raw, and original in a world of mediocrity.Then the CD came. Boo.Aside from the two singles the rest of the album delivers the same old same old... yelling and screaming about injustices in the world and overcrowded prisons and displaced youth, blah, blah blah. I couldn't tell where one song ended and the next began. Look, if these guys ever did spend time in an overcrowded prison or got hit with rubber bullets, then I'll raise the rating.. or maybe if they reveal that half their record sales from their record deal go to amnesty intl. then OK they get a four out of five. But c'mon.... Rage Against the Machine did this already. We don't need anymore preaching guys, let alone screaming nonsense about the government."
negative,"Great movie, not so great book: Well, this was quick. I usually read to page 100 before stopping, but frankly, I have so many books in my TBR pile, I am getting pickier. I can see where this book might be a fun movie to attend, but as for reading, I found Julie an unbearable character, with no depth, another gen-xer. The writing was easy reader 101 and I was just bored. I don't want to be bored, I want a book to grab me and not let go, I want to forget that my bottom is sore from sitting too long. I want to forget that it is 2 am. This book would never do that. So, I put it down at page 63.I do, however think this will be a fun movie to see and plan on doing just that!"
positive,Prophetic and Frightening: Orwell was a prophet. He introduced such words into our vocabulary as 'newspeak' and 'thoughtcrime' which have forever changed the way we look at government. No one who hasn't read 1984 can truly call themselves politically literate.
negative,"Ugh: To preface: I am not religious and I am politically liberal. This book was terrible! The beginning was up to par with all the rest of the novels you can pick up at the grocery store, which warrants a couple of stars, but the ending was terrible! The third secret was just a bunch of the author's political views shoved into the mouth of the Virgin Mary. I was disappointed that I read three-quarters of a book's worth of build-up only to have such a ridiculous climax."
positive,A must for any seeker's library: This is a wonderful book for anyone to read that is seeking to understand the Bible and look for the full meanings of this ageless book.
positive,"Great!: This game is awesome! If you are looking for a really nice and very addicting playstation 2 game that will never make you bored! I would highly recommend this game! The 3d action, and great quality makes this game outstanding, and for Amazon's very low price, this is a must have!"
negative,"Mistitled: My problem with this book is that it is wrongly titled by the reprint publisher (it was originally published in 1925) something that the current editor must have gone along with. The correct title is The New Negro: An Interpretation. This is important for two reasons. All sorts of sloppy readers are citing the book as The New Negro: Voices of the Harlem Renaissance (1925) when no such book exists. Second, the writer of the introduction criticizes the book for not covering a variety of aspects of the Harlem Renaissance when that was not the book's intent. It was ""an interpretation!"" It allows for other interpretations. Nevertheless, it remains one of the best interpretations because it covers more areas of literary and social interpretation of 1925 than any other. Unfortunately, the stunning color illustrations by Winold Reiss that made the book a hot seller in the 1920s are not reproduced in this slick money maker edition."
positive,"great beginner cam: one thing to watch out for,when using the zoom button,dont just let it go after you zoom,or it will click and the noise will be recorded. however,if you edit and can dub different audio then it wont matter. that said, we love the camera.ive been thinking about an off board mic for sterio audio,,just for fun. but since this camera is kinda old now,finding extra parts is kinda tough. when we bought it,they were just comming out and then everything was available,but now,several years later,,, well they arent. ebay or maybe canon outlet in the usa.in fact i just bid on a remote for it,we lost the other one. man,they come in handy.id probly also want a clear over lense to protect the main lense from grit and crud. cheaper to get a new cover than new lense."
positive,"super good: Okay, so I know it published in 2 parts. This book all to books together. P.S. watch the movie after. (read it for 5th grade)"
positive,"The Perfect biography for an excellent Pope and Saint: I Have a real passion for His Holiness Pope St. Pius x, this means that i have read books about him and his life, but this was the absolute best, it is an easy and real fun read. I do recommend this for all ages"
positive,Best mid size cordless drill: I really do like the 9.6 midsize cordless drill. I also have & have owned the smaller model makita drill of 7.2 vold cordless. I like the weight of both drills & I hope the never stop making them. 9.6 volt Makita 6095DWBLEX
negative,"A very dull, unbelievable movie, with horrible audio: I had been wanting to see this ""notorious"" movie for a long time. Now that I have seen it, I can honestly say ""What's The Big Deal?"". Other than the fact that the Camile Keaton gets attacked 3 times, and makes a lot of noise while doing so, I didn't see what's was so horrorible about this movie. The one thing that I found bothersome was the sound. Other than the commentary tracks, there is the original mono audio track, and the new dolby 5.1 surround track. I listened to the latter. It sounded like someone had put the microphone up against another tv to record the sound....This movie is unbelievable because Camille Keaton is raped & sodomized by several men on 3 different occasions, and within a day or so she able to walk around like nothing happened to her."
negative,"Great Material but the Price?!: No way is this book worth the money being asked for it. People are trying to capitalize on the nostalgia players have for this excellent and out of print RPG. Yes the books are getting tough to find and Pooka happens to be a rare one. That doesn't mean a buyer should have to rationalize dishing out over $50 for this paperback that's less than what? 60 pages? I saw here on Amazon someone is asking for almost $300. I can appreciate being a collector but that kind of price tag is pure comedy. My personal recommendation is search for this book for under $30 at MOST. As an owner of this book, I can vouch that it's as fun and nifty to have as you might think, but it's not worth most of your paycheck."
positive,"CLANCY's best: This is my favorite Clancy novel. I'm also happy to say that hollywood has yet to water it down on film. There is action and suspense going on all the time, in many areas. Regardless of what some critics write, I found it a plausible scenario. I don't know a lot about the technicalities of modern warfare, but Clancy has a good track record and after Desert Storm I'm not about to underestimate the capibilities of the U.S. forces."
positive,Love it !: This is a must see for one of the greatest chemist's of our time ! Shulgin & his wife are my hero's :)
positive,Warriors: This is my Favorite book in the warriors saga. Only an author of true skill could write this. I encourage people to read it. You won't be able to stop reading it.
negative,"Julie Powell... Have You No Shame?: I finished this book because I never pass judgement on an incomplete reading.For those who love and revere Julia Child as I do-- this work will sicken you. (Slander and gratuitous potty-mouthed language aside...the maggot infestation will SICKEN you.)I cannot believe they are making a movie from this. Scratch that. We live in 2007... Britney Spears is the most recognized female in the western hemisphere. Bring on the movie, I guess. I'm certain it will be a hit.I have disposed of this book. I would have burned it but book-burning gives me a creepy sort of vibe. This book now resides in my garbage bin. No maggots, though. I clean my kitchen daily."
negative,"Doesn't work with Tivo Basic: This item will not work with Tivo Basic (the Tivo service included on some Pioneer and Toshiba boxes). We bought a Pioneer 810H several years ago that included Tivo. This is Tivo Basic and this item requires Tivo Plus. You do not have a Media Access Key if you have Tivo Basic, which is required to get this to work. Unfortunately, Tivo Plus is an upgrade to Basic, so it costs extra. Since we already paid a lot for the box (equal to a lifetime membership), we didn't want to do that again and sent it back, so I can't really attest to its functionality or ease of use (although it was a huge pain to figure out why we didn't have a MAK...that took some serious googling since they don't make our box anymore)."
positive,"BREATHTAKING CD! INSPIRATIONAL & PASSIONATE!: All of this and more from a man who has the voice of an angel. Clay hits a homerun with songs that affect you in everyday life. Hes extremely talented, his honey tenor voice makes you melt for anticipation for the next song. Thank you Clay and Cannot wait for your next CD! Biding my time to preorder your new Christmas CD which will be out in October!"
positive,"Enjoy the wonder of unadulterated genius at work.: I believe this is the greatest book by one of the best authors of all time. To open a St. Exupery book is to think of the spring sun on a cold, cloudy January day. Where does one go from here? To St. Exupery's soliloquy on finding a meteor in the sands of the Sahara? To his tale of surviving the rigors of the desert? To his description of night over the South Atlantic?It is a question that cannot be answered. One should not even try, but should only linger rhapsodized over each description of even the most mundane things by this irresistable wordsmith. Some people never wrote badly, even once. He was one of them and the world is much poorer for his early departure. At least he left this peerless work about early mail pilots. Adieu, mon cher ami."
positive,"Wow, they don't makes these movies anymore: This movie dosne't make any sense. Twist and turns run rampant thoughout the whole movie. I adore films like this that don't make rym or reason. I love the ending, the really creep dr that is talking about his obession with Holly I think thats her name. Yeas ago I brought this I never watched the god dam thing. They plays over and over agian on Showtime. The bonus about this is you sexy white man without his shirt."
positive,A true clasic: This is a superb book on many levels. Adventure - escaping pirots - going sailing to a tropical island- escapig pirots again - winning out through courage and hardiness. What could be better all done in the comfort of home.It also explores a deeper level: Good friend - bad pirot; trust under extremely difficult conditions; never giving up; loyalty; the sorrow of parting; the ultimate triumph of good. I believe it helped me to become a better man. I first read this book over 55 years ago and have rererd it many times since. I envy you if you have still to explore this clasic tale.
negative,"Might help if you have read Dufresne's previous books before: The book started out interestingly enough, informing the readers about the last surviving member of a New Orleanian clan, before continuing to the meat of the story, which is an upcoming family wedding. The author explores the thoughts and experiences of many characters, which can be confusing. The book even has an supplemental information section at the end of the book that contains materials that might aid in the understanding of what's going on.When reading the book, I got the sense that if I had read Dufresne's previous work about the same clan of characters, that I would've followed the story better. It's not too bad a book if there's nothing else to read."
positive,"Excellent video: This is a 2-disk set, covering 8 different people from various walks of life as they come out to friends and relatives who mean a lot to them. The stories are told honestly and thoroughly. Very moving -- you can feel the anxieties of each person as they approach the coming out moment. I like the way the videos periodically display a quote that is about to be said by someone in the video. Very effective. Each ""story"" runs about 25 minutes. The picture and sound are high quality. We've shown several episodes at our high school's Gay Straight Alliance meetings and they sparked much discussion. I highly recommend this video."
positive,"Gurl, we're so happy U became a momma: Contrary to popular opinion, it's not all about the benjamins, baby. Lauryn, sweet Lauryn, has released a work of art so fresh, so unique, so different than what is heard currently on urban radio. Sadly, much of it probably won't ever garner air play. But the female Fugees vocalist proves she's not only a prolific song writer, but music arranger and producer. Just listen to ""When it Hurts So Bad,"" not to mention, ""Doo Wop."" ""To Zion,"" I believe is the best track, since it deals with a mother's confusion and indecision about whether to keep a child. Her soaring vocals on that track are enuff to get you in church on Sunday morning. But, hey! I am a sentimental, ole, fool. Bottom line: this is a disc well-worth adding to your collection."
positive,"""I LOVE THIS MOVIE"": I think Tremors was a good movie! I only saw about 1 hour of it,and i allready like it! At least it was better than Childs play. I havent see part 2!(i dont really want too,its problably scary.) I wonder if the worms are computerized or machanicle? I give it 5 stars!"
negative,"Pure Boredom: I tried to watch this movie a couple of months ago. I am sorry. I see no sorry. It's a series of unrelated events and unanswered questions. Ugh. I don't see why people love this movie. Even if you are a Transformers' fan, you have to realize that this movie is sooooooooooooooooo boring. I had a hard time trying to watch this movie a second time.If you want real stories, check out Beast Wars and Beast Machines. Now that is entertainment."
negative,"Audible.com: My boyfriend tried to buy this through Audible.com and was told that certain books weren't available in some parts of the country-that authors have some sort of restriction placed on them (apparently even dead ones). Bizarre. The customer service guy couldn't explain why Audible.com had made this version visible and purchasable in our location and denied that charging a monthly fee for what amounts to false advertising was the intent of Audible.com. The whole scenario stunk and after receiving a refund, I can't imagine ever using this company again."
negative,"Absolutely terrible and creepy!: This book did not inspire any white light whatsoever. It starts out as creepy from the very begniing -- starting with a black aith a charcoal drawing of the author's face, which is half shaded in black staring right back at you -- creepiest thing I ever saw. On top of that, you're supposedly praying to God or Creator but he tells you that you have to pray to God calling him by a different name for each prayer-- names which came to him during many many meditations -- I didn't trust this book at all and it was in the trash within 2 days. I'm sorry I ever bought this lousy book."
positive,"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin: I like the story of his life. I like the fact that it was written by him, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone who is interested in the real lives and people of our History."
positive,"No one doing it better...: at their age, And that is what this is all about.At 60-breaking new ground about the definition of who can rockand at what age. Damn good record.Hell, with 16 tracks-how many clunkers? 1-2..maybe?Who else could make that claim today? remarkable......your welcome"
positive,"There's different versions of this story!: T.H.White must have published at least three slightly different versions of this story.When I read the full Once And Future King book a few years ago, there was no Madame Mim episode, there was a buttery version of the fairy castle (Robin Hood) episode, there was an Archimedes/Wild Geese episode, and some other minor changes/additions.When I read a paperback Sword In The Stone twenty years ago, there was a much nicer non-buttery version of the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode, and I don't think the Giant Galapas episode was there, etc.Now I've just read the illustrated hardcover Sword In The Stone edition, and the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode is replaced by an Anthropophagi/RobinHood episode, Giant Galapas is there, and the Archimedes/WildGeese isn't (its been replaced by an Archimedes/Athena episode).Anyone else notice these differences and have an explanation for them?"
positive,"Great Early Dixie Chicks Single!: ""Goodbye Earl"" was the single that opened my eyes for the Dixie Chicks. This single taken from their first album ""Wide Open Spaces"" is much more ""country"" than ""Earl"", but there is a charm and optimism in the song that your ""troubles"" are likely to seem less burdening after listening to it.""Am I the Only One"" written by Maria McKee is a fine up-beat country-ballad also taken from the album.The remix-version of ""There's Your Trouble"" is good, but the remix doesn't really add anything to the original version which is just great as it is."
negative,"Sizes Are Slightly Off: This set has a great assortment, but some of the sizes (27/64 and others) are slightly off and are too small. I've thrown this out and purchased an accurate set."
negative,"Horrible leaky diapers!: We decided to try the subscribe and save program and had been using Pampers Cruisers Stage 3. I had never really noticed a specific title with the diapers we had been using. They had been wonderful. So, we decided to try the only Pampers that were available in this size. Despite the claim that they last up to 12 hours, each of the three that we used on our baby boy leaked. Awful, awful, awful!"
positive,"Beautifully Written: ""Fathers and Sons"" comes very close to perfection. At times, Turgenev's use of the language borders on poetry. The characters are intriguing and sympathetic. The novel deals beautifully with man's inability to live without holding something sacred, and its tragic ""hero"" goes to the grave realizing that he has been trying to fill that void with ""straw"" instead of something more meaningful--like faith, or family, or true love.Some critics have said that Turgenev supported the ""nihilists,"" the young men who scoffed at all things sacred. They say Bazarov is the hero of the novel, intended to be idolized. But I consider it impossible to read ""Fathers and Sons"" and not be moved by a deep need to hold something--anything--sacred."
positive,"My Review: Ms. Hunter's book was fantastic! Very seldom do I find a book that is as captivating as Waiting For the World to End. So many times I found myself relating to either Tom Olsen, Mary, or Ben Wendling. There are so many lessons that can be learned from this book that I will carry with me for many years to come. I strongly urge you to read Waiting For the World to End if you have not yet. I guarantee you will be able to relate to it in many differeny ways, and that you will find yourself savoring each page. 2 Thumbs Up!"
negative,BROKE AFTER MINIMAL USE: I purchased this item for my 1 and 3 year olds. The boys loved it but within a few weeks it became unusable. One of the velcro tabs used to keep the coils together when storing it fell off so it no longer folded up flat. I think that led to pressure in part of the fabric so the metal that creates the coil shape tore through the fabric. Due to this sharp protruding metal we can no longer safely use the tunnel. I would not recommend that people buy this product.
positive,"Fascinating guided tour. Highly recommended.: This devotional is a terriffic, fresh approach to reading through the Bible in an overview or summary format. Each day's reading (using a modern translation) is accompanied by brief and informative text from Brenda Quinn or Philip Yancey, and then 1 or 2 questions to ponder. Both Quinn and Yancey have a reader-friendly, intelligent manner of writing that invites one to think rather than telling one what to think.Makes a nice gift book, too."
positive,Crazy Good Seeds: These seeds grew like CRAZY!!! I planted them in the summer and one day they grew three inches before lunch. Granted that is not typical but overall - outstanding. Great value for the price too - 5lbs is a LOT of seeds.
positive,"Peace & Positivity: This CD is blazin'. Slim Kid of the Pharcyde is really doin' his thang. Tre is rapsanging over smooth tracks. This CD won't get you Crunked....but sometimes U need to simmer down and just chill out. And this is what this CD does. Chilled, laid back, with positivity oozing from every single tracks. MC Lyte, Charlie 2na, NDea Davenport, and the ""Slam"" artist Saul Williams add their essence, making all 17 tracks a powerful blend. My favs are Ayyomyman, Roots, Love, & Culture, & Playing House...But no doubt, all tracks are hot!!!! Don't sleep on this CD."
positive,"Just as described: This bench was easy to assemble, but I would suggest that you have someone else help you to hold the parts while you screw them together. Otherwise it might be too difficult, not in design, but just in holding the large pieces in the right place. I put the bench on my front patio which is uncovered. It doesn't usually snow in Seattle, but it did this year, and the bench remained uneffected. The bench has also with stood the Seattle rains. This bench is as stated, element proof! Great for summer yard lounging as well. I have been 100% satisfied!"
negative,Missing Content: this book is missing parts from chapter 2. You can read the missing contents for free on wikipedia.
negative,"An abomination: I'm a Stanford-trained MD and practicing psychiatrist and I have to say that this book is worse than terrible. It is the most dangerous kind of religious propaganda mixed in with a hefty dose of hateful, spurious, ignorant ideas."
negative,"No results for me: I bought this with the hope of boosting the signal from my large attic-mounted outdoor aerial antenna. I have a 3-way splitter sending the signal to the TVs in the house. My house is ~30 miles from the antennas on South Mountain with clear line of sight. Things were fine before June 2009, but since the digital changeover a few of the Phoenix channels (12, 15, 45, 51, 61) have become weak and sporadic (available one day, not the next). One of my TVs has a signal meter. It read ""75"" before I installed the booster, and ""67"" was the best I could get after I put it inline between the antenna and the 3-way splitter. Since installing the booster I no longer get 12.1 (or subchannels) on one TV, and cannot get 15.1 (or subchannels) on the others. On all TVs channel 45.1 and it's subchannels stutter as if half of the digital bits are coming through."
positive,"The Album That Introduced Many People To Rock & Roll's Blues Roots: George Thorogood & The Destroyers' self-titled debut album is also his best ever. What a lot of people who are against alcohol don't realize is that the drinking songs are just a facade for the fact that Thorogood introduced the majority of the rock audience to the music's blues roots. The best songs on this album are ""Madison Blues and ""Ride On Josephine"", the latter of which is a Bo Diddley cover. Being that I don't drink, I feel that the aforementioned songs will be remembered long after ""I Drink Alone"" and ""(If You Don't Start Drinkin') I'm Gonna Leave"" have faded out of memory. This album is the first place to discover George Thorogood and his great, rootsy band."
negative,"What a shameful letdown: Shameful attempt at a hybrid of horror, action and suspends that cast Keanu Reeves as occult detective John Constantine in an adaptation of the vertigo comic book that loses it's edge and goes for the gusto in flat out stupidly with a boring acting turn by Keanu Reeves who just does not come across well in the role. The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness. Nether of them however can save this runaway train that should have been checked before it left the tracks."
positive,"My wife loves them!: Nice set, very soft and comfortable, they are made slightly oversized and fit a thick mattress perfectly.A few strings came off them at first washing, but no unravelling or fraying.an excellent bargain at the $12 they cost me on clearance sale."
negative,"1984 is a classic that doesn't deserve to be.: While regarded as a ""classic"" by some literary scholars, 1984 is devoid of nearly every element of classical literature. The fall of Communism has erased nearly every trace of relevance this book may once have had. Its warnings of the evils of totalitarianism were overly alarmist by even Cold War standards and are even more so today. The absence of strong, 3-D characters makes even a man vs. society theme seem sorely lacking in depth . The only redeeming quality of this book may lie in providing future readers with an McCarthyist view of the evils of communism from the standpoint of a conservative 50s faux intellectual. If you're looking for a deeper, better-written, and tremendously more entertaining book, try Orwell's Animal Farm. Even walking, talking farm animals seem realistic compared to 1984."
negative,"not too late for tears: This is the worst quality DVD we have ever received and have already sent it back for a refund. It was obviously taped from TV with annoying cuts and missing footage. The overall quality was abysmal. We rent and buy lots of older films and this is the worst one we have EVER gotten. Whoever packaged this should be ashamed. In addition, the title was misspelled on the package (to instead of too). That should have been a tip off to the quality of the DVD."
negative,"sadly disappointing: I bought this book based on the many good reviews, and was sadly disappointed. While I commend Ms Holmes on her thoroughness and attention to detail, this book was missing the humour I was looking for. As I was reading this book I kept wishing it had been written by Bill Bryson."
negative,"This may be the biggest disappointment for a sequal... ever!: Dune has about seven interweaving plot layers. This book has maybe one, which is life and death. At just 278 pages this book is by far the shortest book in the six book series. If you've loved Dune, you'll probably hate the sequal so don't read it."
positive,ignition: This is a classic trance song that always gets the party bumpin. Hold on tight 'cause you might lose yourself in this mindblowin' countdown to ignition. you wont be able to stop yourself from movin'.
positive,Great book: Cannery Row is about a very strange community. Steinbeck uses wonrderful plot lines. I recommend this.
positive,"NASB: Most probably the best Bible I have owned. The NASB is probably the closest English translation to the original Hebrew and Greek, and is very easy to understand."
positive,"He just keeps getting better and better!: Personally, every time i buy a new Dierks album, i find it better than the previous one! ok, there aren't that many albums out yet, but still! This album's got some killer tracks! it sound very country it really makes you wanna dance!"
positive,caving in South Dakota: What an adventure Jan and Herb Conn experienced! I have had the great experience of actually meeting the Conns in person and they are as delightful to visit with as they are in the book. Anyone who is into speleology should buy this book and relish the fun and science occuring through-out it.
negative,"What did they do to him???: After listening to the first few songs of the album I've been waiting months for, I had to look and make sure I picked-up the right one. It doesn't even sound like him, which is ironic since most of his audience liked him for the way he sounds!!! The songs could use some help, but at least they used songs by serious song writers, such as Desmond Child. Let's just hope that Clay can hang around enough to go his own way and sound the way he did before."
positive,"Strange and Wonderful: Rich characters, refreshing originality, a good story, and plenty of surprises. Not much to criticize except to say the story is unorthodox and the ending is peculiar...both of which add to the satisfaction if you like the unexpected. I was looking for something different and absorbing and was rewarded with O'Brian's work. Highly recommended."
positive,"I wanted to love this book: and I very nearly did.For the first half to three quarters I was utterly and completely amazed. The character of Miss Havisham is genius, and a character like none I have ever met before in literature. The images of her sitting corpse like in her decaying house will stick with me for all time. Everyone should read this book for this fascinating character.While the first part of the book delighted me with wicked satire, and dark humor, the last quarter of the book was too morally right for me. Every character saw the error of his ways, and strove to be a better person, and here the book lost much of the original feel it had going for it. I suppose maybe in Dickens' time, he couldn't get away with a book that did not have a morally uplifting ending.However, I say this is a must-read for the characters of Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella alone. Also the lawyer Jaggers is a great character."
positive,"14 YEARS OF LOVING THIS STYLE: My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued."
positive,A must have for any Simpsons fan!: I am a hardcore simpsons fan and the quality of these videos is outstanding! I personally like the shorts in between the two episodes on each tape from when the simpsons were on the Tracy Ullman Show.
negative,"Uh...: Constantine was the corniest movie I think i've ever seen.I don't remember much of it because I was so busy cussing under my breath about wasting $8.50 on such nonsense. I haven't ever rolled my eyes, sucked my teeth, or scoffed so much in my entire life. I almost fell out of my seat when Keanu Reeve's gave the devil the finger. Talk about pure cheese."
negative,nexdt time I'll go to the store: The product works well...but the shipping & handling nearly doubled the cost. If I had just gone to the store...
positive,"Funny & Cute: I saw this movie a little after it was released in the theatres back in 1995. It's about a gay man that is trying to come to terms with the changing sexual landscape of the '90s. Back in '95, this movie was really funny with a serious overtone to it. Watching it again, it still remains funny but seems really dated in it's attitude towards HIV & AIDS. Even though it seems dated, this doesn't take away from the charm of this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes ""arthouse movies"" or gay themed movie fare."
positive,"Great MP3 Player: This is a great MP3 player. It has great funtionability and an easy to read screen. It comes with 128mb on board, which is just huge and has the option to expand that memory with smartmedia. The compression option seems to work well and vastly improves the amount of music you can put on the player. I don't think the rechargeable battery quite reaches the advertised 20 hours of use and neither does a duracell ulta AAA reach the 12 hour mark. The voice recording function is neat, but I don't use it. I don't use the FM tuner much either. Download speeds are acceptable with USB 1.0 and beign compatible with USB 2.0 download speeds should be exceptional.All in all this is a great player and it is well worth it's price. I also have an MP3 player by DGN and I payed a little more for it. Right now, I don't know which one to keep."
negative,"Why isn't this labeled as a short story?: It is really annoying to start reading a book only to find out that it is a short story. This could have been an interesting book, but it only took about half an hour to read. I don't understand why it is not mandatory to label short stories so that people know what they are buying."
negative,"I feel as if I got scammed by Paramount: Let's start out with the film. I would say that this Transformers film rivals the first one in quality. It's really that good. I would give it a solid four out of five. This was the first film that I had seen in IMAX 3-D after returning to the states from being stationed overseas. I was completely blown away with the 3-D effects and sound. However, I feel as if I have been duped by Paramount in that when I opened my blu-ray combo pack there was a 5 or 10 dollar off coupon for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3-D, Blu-ray/DVD+ Digital Copy! I know that the studio is trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of us, but come on! They probably had the 3-D version ready but wanted to milk us some more. I would not recommend buying this version and waiting on the newer one scheduled to release soon.So to summarize:Film- 4Shady Blu-ray release business practices- 1 (negative if I could)"
positive,"Horton Touches a Tender Heart: This book can be looked at in a more adult way if we consider the need for adoption of many little-ones that need loving, dedicated true blue parents to become involved no matter what it takes and to weather the storms as they shelter the young. Good for you Horton. You are a blessing to me, keep on being faithful and true to your word, because an elephant's faithful no matter what."
positive,"VERY GOOD: I THOUGHT THIS WAS A EXCELLENT CD DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE LEAD SINGER KHAN,HAS AN EXCELLANT VOICE.THAT IS NO SMALL THING NOW THAT MOST OF THE POPULAR HARD DRIVING BANDS NOW HAVE SINGERS THAT CAN`T SING A LICK.GIVING AN EXAMPLE OF BAD BANDS OUT THERE ARE KORN AND SYSTEM OF THE DOWNOR DRONE IF YOU WILL.CHECK THESE GUYS OUT IF YOU ARE YOU ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE SAME OLD BS.THESE GUYS ROCK BUT CAN STILL GET MELLOW.CHECK OUT THE SONG DON`T YOU CRY,GREAT SONG."
negative,"Well i Know Where All The Talent went After At The Drive In Broke up!: First off, my opinion comes from a musicians veiw.I began listening to At the drive in when they hit the scene in the mid 90s....i was turned on by their weird time changes and aggersive vocals. When the band broke up i was upset and i felt that the void would not be filled. When i heard Omar was fronting The mars volta i knew he would stay true to experimental music, and indeed i was correct.I can not say the same for Sparta how ever, i find that Cedric's vocals are often flat and they sound more like an unexperienced singer. Their music falls short, maybe more production could be used to beef up the songs. I find comparing the mars volta to sparta an unfair comparision. The songs in general are caught up trying to be punk when they sound more like un inpsired emo tunes.......i guess maybe they are trying to hard to please......have you seen the videos!"
positive,"good fidelity; could use a preamp: AudioSource AMP-100 Stereo Power AmplifierThis amp powers a pair of medium two-way speakers for my home theater. Very good sound for the money. As others have noted, the line inputs are not terribly sensitive, and my Blue-ray player's line outs put out barely enough; I crank the amp's volume control almost all the way up with most movies. No one has complained of insufficient volume. (Someone wrote that there is a line-in sensitivity adjustment or a max gain adjustment or the like, but I cannot find it.) A preamp with a 3- or 4-volt line out would solve this problem and add needed spectrum control, but at greatly increased cost. You can power either of two pairs of speaker connections but not both; the spec sheet is a little vague on this point. I wouldn't upgrade from this amp before spending at least $2000 on speakers."
positive,"I'd buy again: I searched long and hard for a Stereo Bluetooth headset based on Bluetooth 2.0 for a decent price. I link it to my cell phone, which has an MP3 player built into it. It works and sounds very good, and if I get a call, a simple touch pauses the music and answers; then another touch to hang up and go back to the music. The mic works well, even though there's no boom visible.Most stereo headsets are expensive, and/or based on the BT 1.1 or 1.2 std., which is must less reliable and poorer quality. I believe GE just slaps there name on this, but like most of the GE products (except for the wireless phones), it appears to be good quality.The only problem I've had is that most of the time it will no connect to my phone automatically, but this can just as easily be an issue with my Nokia cell. I just assigned a shortcut key to it to add convenience.Definitely been a good purchase so far. I hope it's as durable; it appears to be sturdy, and folds up well."
negative,"Great flexibility, poor manufacturing quality: Although these cables give you a lot of options, the spring-loaded storage discs are rather poor in quality. Getting the cables to retract fully takes several minutes and a lot of tinkering. This would be an invaluable tool overall if they just used a higher quality wind-up device."
positive,"Works well but is a little big for females: This 20 lb. vest is great for doing chores around the house, walking, and working out. It does not have a strong odor, like some other reviews suggested. The one thing that might be a problem is the fit. I'm a 5'5'' female with a small frame. So the vest is slightly bulky. I don't mind because I don't use it to walk out in public, just around the house and at a private gym. Other than that it works great!"
negative,"SOUNDS LIKE JOE, TRYING TO SOUND LIKE JOE: This is the crux Joe is at now. He can't quite achieve the dynamic energy level he once had when he performed these songs on a regular basis. And it seems no one has told him this yet. The result is a mixed bag of familiar tunes, with Joe sounding a bit unconvinced about material he once sang so...convincingly. While the playing is fairly tight, and Joe does show flashes of the old Joe here and there, this is still for me, an unsatisfying album."
negative,"Why? Oh Why? This is just an outrage.: The temptation to re-make movies is evidence of the fact that there is little creativity in Hollywood. This movie is evidence that there are people in Hollywood who should not be allowed to go to movies let alone make them.The original is not all that great, but it was in fact original and had some very interesting photography and stunts. This version is insipid to the point of stupidity; the photography stinks, and the stunts are mostly cut-and-paste special effects.The people who made this should be banned from any association to movie making for life! So why did I buy it? By mistake! I had a copy of the original and thought a comparison would be interesting. I was wrong. Learn from my error and avoid this like the very plague."
positive,"Almost all what you need: This is an excelent material. Get this book, and buy another pack of practice tests from the web (plenty of them around) and you're all set. Just keep in mind that you need to have solid bases to benefit from this book and other practice tests; Nobody and nothing will teach you probability, algebra, grammar, etc... in a month. The author has a good sense of humor, which makes this book more readable and not so boring in such the painful task of studying for GMAT. Only drawback is that quantitative section problems in the real one are more difficult (better say, more time consuming) than the ones that come in ANY practice test. Always keep in mind that this is an ADAPTIVE test when studying, so, create your strategy for how much time to spend on the first 10-15 questions of each section."
negative,"Bought as a gift for the ex-wife...: Are you serious? I bought this as a gift for my ex-wife. I selected the gift wrap option, but when she got it, she told me the wrapping paper was missing. When she opened up the tin, there was nothing inside. What the heck are you trying to pull here?!I want my money back.Side note...My other ex-wife received hers in good order."
negative,"Darn!: I really wanted to enjoy this cd, but as many times as I have listened to it......I just cant. Yes, Clay has a good voice, but I hear no emotion in it. Maybe a better choice of songs for his voice would help. I feel, in time, he will mature into a more rounded performer."
positive,"! A DEFINITE ACADEMY!!: This movie is excellent! Everything from the acting to the storyline! It truly deserves an Academy, atleast a nomination! Anyone who enjoyed movies like: (my other classic favorites) Traffic, Scarface, & Desperado will DEFINETLY like this for sure!!! And for ALL out there,...WE-COLOMBIANS are NOOOT bad people at all & COLOMBIA IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY, DESPITE... Y para mi gente, este cine es la bomba!Paz...peace out!"
negative,"Fuse assemply poorly designed: Unless you catch it, I've unplugged the until from a rental car and not noticed the end screw holding the fuse has come off and I'm left with a worthless cable after I discover the situation when I get home. Yeah it's my fault but it's still poorly designed -- I've had two other units just stop working (after the warranty of course)."
negative,"Very Disappointed ...: Well - this was my son's #1 request from Santa Claus. Despite the reviews, he brought it to our house. As expected, it is quite flimsy. It is sad to watch my 5 yr old struggle with the elevator while trying to give batman a ride. It is so pathetic how these toy companies take advantage of children, and (their parents!) with such poor quality merchandise."
negative,"Very Disapointed!: I've gone thru two Keurig Machines both of them broke,Also have friends who have notthing but problems with theirs.I recently bought the Tassimo T65 after using it at my work and friends house I absolutley love it!Yes Keurig wins with their big selection in coffees but honestly I would have my two favorites that I would always buy and that was it, If you want good quality coffee get the Tassimo Hands down! definitley has the tastiest coffee"
negative,This movie was trite.: The storyline was cliched and the one-liners weren't even funny. The Australian accent from the cute boyfriend was annoying. Piper Perabo can NOT act (even though she's hella cute) and all the coyotes were too pretty. It was distracting. Don't waste your time.
negative,"Weeds and other trash: This series, like its predecessors is nothing but trash. It is soft porn (and not so soft), derides all morals and sensibilities, and is an insult to one's intelligence. Steer well clear."
negative,"mediocre: i didn't care for this cd. it is a Christian goth group that has disappeared and I can see why. not anything special. if you are a collector of christian goth, a friend of the bands, or a fan then get it otherwise don't waste your time."
negative,"Avoid this book: This book, while ""thorough"" is so fear inducing that any pregnant woman with a low-risk pregnancy shoud steer clear at all costs. The author, month-by-month, lists typical discomforts alongside extremely rare complications thus alarming the pregnant woman that this could likely be her fate. He does not inform her that the likelihood of having one of these problems is very rare. I would have rather have seen a listing somewhere else in the book of such possibilities and the symptoms to watch for. Rather than have this book at all, I recommend Gentle Birth Choices, Birthing From Within or anything by Sheila Kitzinger. All were written by women with the approach that birth is a normal, natural physiologic state for the pregnant woman. While they discuss complications, they are not assumed to be lurking at every corner so the woman must be hyper vigilant for such problems."
negative,"Not what I expected.: I am a big fan of Tony Robbins, but this DVD was only a small segment of the RPM system and is a little bit of a commercial. I have heard the old version of this time management system and it is amazing. If you have never heard Anthony Robbins before, this might be worth checking out. It is just a small sample of his stuff. Then, if you are convinced, invest in the full system."
positive,"Bugliosi Brings Out Manson's True Darkness: Helter Skelter is one of those books that leave you in dismay because you can't believe the logic in the Tate-LaBianca murders. The ""family"" is truely an unbelievable group of people that absolutely butchered for the begining Helter Skelter. I would strongly recomend it to anyone."
negative,"Interesting content, poor writting and editing: The stories of the people depicted in the book are interesting. Ranging from really interesting to somewhat interesting. These were people that made a difference and deserve our respect. However the book is poorly put together. It seems as if I am watching a TV show on paper. A poor end result. Would not recommend."
negative,"Such promise; such disappointment: Perhaps I will be accused of owning tickets to ""Short Attention-Span Theatre,"" but my best efforts to plow through this lush but frank effort were all for naught. Hollinghurst, as advertised, possesses a wondrous facility for words; even the most mundane acts are described with a fluent accuracy that the reader is inclined, often, to exclaim, ""yes, that's it. He said it perfectly!"" Nevertheless, lovely writing does not a compelling novel make, and that, combined with a penchant for a relentless gay-dominated, ""where's my next man?"" theme, simply left me at the station. Others may choose to take this ride, especially if first chapter anal male sex is your metier, but even this tolerant reader was looking for more than the constant longing found in Nick's loins. Fine writing can be found elsewhere in countless more compelling efforts."
positive,"A Masterpiece of Live Music: If you have ever had any kind of reaction to a song of Peter Gabriel's--i.e. if you have a pulse--then this album is for you. This ""reviewer"" hasn't attended a whole lot of concerts--I hadn't even heard many of these PG songs previously--but this album has to be one of the best productions of any live album ever. The music, the energy, the band, the production--all combine to make this a near flawless masterpiece of sometimes driving and sometimes reflective emotion. Nothing else--live or studio--comes close. Trust me. Peter Gabriel is a musically and emotionally expressive genius."
positive,"Book review: This is a book for all parents or parents to be, all people thinking of having children. Love and Logic is a program to help you be a more effect parent, raising responsible children. It can also be used on co workers and the rest."
negative,"Disappointed: Had the artists of this CD been listed on the website, I would not have bought it. To be honest, out of the 20 songs on the CD, I only purchased it for ""Just an Illusion"" by Imagination and what I thought was ""Young Hearts Run Free"" by Candi Staten. I've been looking for the two everywhere...Oh it has the song but it's not by Candi! It's by someone I've never heard of....I'm very disappointed....then I decided to give it a try...IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!"
negative,"It's not new, it's used: It arrived in an amazon box with cushion. Inside the perfume box was beat up and covered in something sticky. Oh, and about 25% of the perfume was already used."
positive,great sleep inducer!: Our baby was fascinated with this almost right from the start. When we transitioned him from the cradle in our room to his crib @ 4 mos. we'd turn it on right away when we laid him down in the crib. He wouldn't fuss that we were leaving him in the crib - he was too wrapped up in the Ocean Wonders.Older babies can turn it on themselves easily too (which he does now @ 7mos - sometimes.) The batteries are just starting to wear down after 3 mos.+ of nightly use.We'd consider this an ESSENTIAL for a new baby & a PERFECT shower gift!
positive,"Mission:Perfect: I have read so many mixed reviews about this film. Especially where M:I is compared to M:I 2. DON'T COMPARE THE TWO! They are two entirely different movies.So what if Ethan Hunt becomes the 21st century James Bond.I did not find the plot confusing. A lot of people are put off because they claim this M:I has ""no action."" But this is a true drama in the sense! I watch this almost every night and see something different everytime.DePalma's irregular camera angles of the actors add to the tense pace. Acting is top notch. Casting is perfect. John Voight plays the ""mole""/badguy to perfection. Vanessa Redgrave was a pleasant suprize. And Cruise is as usual at his best! And I don't mind the use of the interchangeable faces in this M:I or M:I 2. I hope Cruise keeps it in M:I 3"
negative,"It sucks!: Clay has an incredible beautiful voice, but the song selections are annoyingly boring! I found myself skipping each sound alike song until I reached the start of the CD...I want my money back. Clay, your CD sucks"
positive,"Very Good; an unforgettable Classic.: Peter Tosh was one of the Greatest Reggae song writers and performers of his time. Unfortunately, despite the fact that they were colaborators and friends, his success is overshadowed by the equally beautiful Bob Marley. Peter Tosh, who co-wrote and co-performed the song ""Get Up, Stand Up"" with Mr. Marley, wrote music and lyrics with such astounding beauty and deeply personal meaning that they can bring tears to your eyes. Where as Bob Marley was a poet and a prophet, Peter Tosh was the truth-teller and the sooth-seer (sp?). His work is often darker, and the subject matter more controversial than Bob Marley, but he was equally brilliant. This collection is incredible, and I highly suggest to any fan of Bob Marley, reggae, or ska."
negative,"If Specialty Coffee Is Your Thang, Do NOT Buy!: I was really excited to get this machine, hearing lots of good reviews about it and exploring the over 200 fabulous (sounding) flavors that are offered. However, when i got the machine, there was only one taste i could find: bitter. I tried over 15 different k-cups, ultimately only liking one, the cafe mocha (escape). None of the flavors could be tasted properly. Gingerbread, hazelnut, french vanilla, breakfast blend: BLECH!*If you are the person who goes to Starbucks for flavored coffees and frappuccinos, do NOT buy!The only reason i gave this 2 stars is the concept, simply putting a cup in and some water and receiving coffee in less than 20 seconds.Great idea, terrible coffee."
negative,"Great boot, Sturdy, Comfortable, But those darn laces!!: They keep coming untied! If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars. The boot is waterproof, it is comfortable, wont give you calluses or corns. But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it, they will inevitably become undone! The first time: ""umm? maybe I should tie them tighter"", The second time: ""just a little tighter, Ugh it's cutting my circulation"", The third time: ""Ok this is ridiculous, let me try tying em different"", the unfteenth time: ""you m$#%^ stupid $%^ Boot from hell $%^&..."" lol I threw the boots into a lake and hiked in my sandals the rest of the way... Never again will I buy boots with hooks for tying...thanks for reading"
positive,"Mel Gibson-Wild on the Set: The original concept was interesting. (By a freak of blow-dryers and bath-bubbles, a male chauvinist brat [normal guy] gains the ability to hear all women's thoughts.) Add Mel Gibson to the film; and you've electrified an instant classic.Almost every other line is a laugh your heart out joke; and every character in the film is acted to the hilt. It's enough to make you swear Mel Gibson, Helen Hunt, and probably the entire cast and crew of this film ought to be a awarded a perscription for Riddlin.In short: if this film can't make you smile and laugh, You're Dead."
negative,"i despise this book: this is possibly the dumbest book of all time. i really hated it. it is the most unbelievable story ive ever seen. it is so far away from bein a classic. i cant say that i hate nazis because im a christian, but have u people forgotten about Omaha Beach or the holacaust. many good americans,britains, canadians and others died trying to save the world from the accursed nazis. Any one who fought with the german army were nazis. and thats all. six million jews died because of people like anton reiker. anton may not have been evil but he fought along with nazis. and its alot like hanging with the wrong crowd. if u hang with drug dealing gang members u gotta pay also. for all of you people who think this book is a classic, maybe u should go see saving private ryan or schindlers list. maybe that will change your mind about this book."
negative,Just okay: I was disapointed in this book. Although the book was in good shape and fast delivery. It was the content that was lacking. Which is the chance you take when you order a book without looking inside to see first.
positive,Great brush.: This brush is a tighter fit the the phosphor bronze brush that comes with most kits. I have found this to help get my guns cleaned faster. I have gotten one of these for every caliber I own.
negative,"Four year old purrs while I hiss.: This is a very attractive game. Cool cover art. Neat purple wooden mice and two fun dice with a sleeping cats, dinner bowls, and left pointing arrows. You basically take turns rolling these dice and either: doing nothing, giving a mouse to the player on your left, taking a mouse from the dinner bowl, or putting a mouse in the dinner bowl.That's all there is to it. There is no strategy whatsoever and no where to grow once you master the mechanics of rolling dice and moving mice. My four-year-old has wanted to play it once since we bought it, but to me it's a very tiring ordeal. I envy the cats sleeping on the dice.This game is good for teaching very young children how to take turns and roll dice, but not a whole lot more. Just think that when you buy a game this simple for young children, you will likely have to play it with them, over and over and over."
negative,"A piece of junk 3 times over: My first B70 lasted 3 months and stopped pumping water. Keurig replacedd it with a new unit. That one lasted about a month and started shutting off in the middle of brewing. After 90 minutes with customer service and getting the third degree, keurig said we'll send you a new one, but if we don't receive the K-cup holder from that unit by mail within thirty days you will be charged for the repacement unit. A few days later I received a email saying they were out of inventory and it would take 2 weeks to arrive. The third unit finally arrived and guess what, after 2 days and 4 cups of coffee the pump stopped working. After reading all the bad reviews on amazon it appears Keurig has not attempted to fix the problem and just keeps sending out defective units and hoping for the best. I'll be calling today to try and get my money back."
negative,buying cd eurovision delux: It would be helpful if you could put what songs are on this cd as I have a few and wouldn't like to duplicate them.
negative,This book is auful !!: If I could give this book a rating of less than 1 I would..... it deserves it. Much of the information is wrong (Frank Tower ??? PLEASE !) The authors reliance on foul language to make his point ... all of this makes this book an annoying piece of trash unfit for anyone to read !
positive,"Well worth the cost!: I'm mostly an X-Men fan, so this book has a lot of info that is new to me and therefore i find it very informing and entertaining.Surely it has some minor mistakes and lack of details, but the whole presentation, the printing quality and the artwork are simply perfect.After all,the Marvel Universe is so vast that one book alone could never cover it.At the end, all you get is a sincere effort,great for new readers and well worth its cost!"
negative,"My husband even complains about these!!: These diapers are junk! I recently tried some Pampers again and they were terrible! The tabs would rip off half the time and this would really make my husband disgruntled! I told him Pampers are supposed to be the ""best"" in the diaper area! He told me to stick with the Huggies! Boys and girls, quality, price, Huggies are the way to go in our household! I would not recommend these diapers for anyone, unless you like throwing unused daipers into the garbage can!"
positive,Cool album: One of Klaus's late eighties works and a soundtrack to boot it offers some of Klaus's more attmospheric music from that era. Taking the best stuff from the eighties and mixing them into a soundtrack Klaus created a decent album comparable and better than much of tangerine Dreams soundtrack stuff from around the sametime. A forgotten gem.
negative,"What in the world???: This book is confusing and pointless. To many things happen at once, it far toooooooooo confusing!!! dragons, hobbits, elves & wizards just aren't my thing. Don't buy this book if you haven't read it, rent it from a library or something, cuz' if you don't like it, it's a big waist of money."
positive,"Tess of the D'Urbevilles: This book was a true tragedy between two social classes and a girl who tried helping her family and herself at the same time, and yet she suffered for it in the end."
positive,"Great read, and down to the point.: This book was my first time management book. I've picked up ""The Time Trap"" by Alec Mackenzie after this reading, and in comparison, this book is much more thorough. The best part about this book I think is the simple idea of prioritizing your to do list. I have started to do this and found myself to be able to get more important things done. It also helps greatly with your concentration for the current task by stating to yourself that this is the most important task to do at the moment. Anyhow, great time management book for newbies."
negative,"Good for a little while, but....: Sure, this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an iPod. But with a low price, comes lower quality. Our special friends at Creative gave this thing good sound quality, great features, long battery life, and an unbeatable price. The catch is it's built like a piece of crap. It lasted about 1 1/2 weeks. I didn't abuse it, I charged it every day, but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out. I tried re-setting it, I tried just about every pair of headphones in my house (10 pairs), and nothing worked. So I contacted customer service at Creative, but they said, ""If the product seems broken, we cannot help,"" or something to that effect. Wow. Don't get me wrong, the thing was like heaven for about a week. If you want a quality mp3 player, splurge on an ipod. If you really need to save, buy this thing on Amazon, they eventually gave me a full refund. I bought myself an RCA mp3-cd player, and I'm happy with that until a cheap, worthwhile mp3 player coomes out."
positive,Best condom for your $: Compared to every other condom this is the best. Their more expensive line of condoms really doesn't offer any advantage in my opinion other than packaging. This one wins hands down.
negative,"curious explanations of behavior: Too many statements of duratiion of time profiling with clear poor grasp of human behavior. ""No mother would act this way."" Vain, aging beauty queen mothers facing their 40th birthday with a history of dolling up in tights and rouge their preschool age children can probably be suspected of behavior slightly different from the norm. Interesting cases presented, but interpretations of behaviors are superficial, lack insight, lack curiosity. Why did Patsy Ramsey sit unmoved on the sofa while others with her reacted to screams from the basement--Duh.. No clear answer to who would sit and compose lengthy note without worry of discovery--Duh. I am inspired to seek other authors for insights."
positive,"Good Razors, Reasonable Price for Subscribe & Save.: PROS:1. Good quality razors, for my wife, daughter, and myself.2. Price is reasonable, if you are on subscribe & save plan.CONS:1. Pricey if not using Amazons ""Subscribe & Save"".2. Can find cheap at your local discount stores.I used Amazons Subscribe and Save for the easy of use since my family uses razors at a regular interval. I hate shopping at the brick & mortar discount stores."
positive,"A picture book adaptation of the classic story of adventure: Treasure Island is a picture book adaptation of the classic story of adventure, which has been carefully abridged for younger readers. The expressive full-color, museum quality illustrations by the late N. C. Wyeth perfectly complement this great classic by the great nineteenth-century author Robert Louis Stevenson. Treasure Island is very highly recommended for novice readers just about ready to graduate from picture book to reading to more involved and complex stories."
positive,"Walkthrough.......................: ..................that packs lbs onto your harvest. Gains, gains and more gains. If I have any questions I turn to The Cannabis Grow Bible: the definitive guide to growing marijuana for recreational and medical use, because the answer is always in here and always top stuff. I have gone from respectable harvests to super sized gains. This is a walkthrough from start to finish that shows you all the pros and cons of doing it this way or that way. You get loads of alternatives on each of the growing methods. It even shows you how to build your own hydroponics if you want hydro. It is very cheap to grow an unbelievable bulk of quality skunk if you learn how with this book. I want to say thanks, thanks, thanks for the excellence that I found in here."
negative,"Shelters of Stone: After reading and being totally captivated by the first 4 of the series, I waited impatiently for book #5. I am very disappointed in the book, but will continue to have high hopes for the conclusion of the series.My harshest criticism is of the sentence structure throughout the book. The writer did a poor job of portraying ""cave-man style"" conversation or speaking. Two sentences run together, separated by a comma do not depict primitive language or thought, and I do not remember seeing this in Ms. Auel's other books.Also, I resent stumbling over explicit sex in a book which I have chosen for reasons other than hot sex or romance. If you must, one explicit scene would be quite enough, and any other occasion to include romance or intimacy could be handled differently.I could not recommend this book to anyone, but strongly encourage everyone to read The Clan of the Cave Bear, Passage of the Plains, Valley of the Horses, and Mammoth Hunter. They were 100% superb!"
negative,"This book is horrible: You may think that a book about Saturday Night Live would be fun or perhaps even entertaining. Well this one is not. I hate to disagree with the other reviewers but the book was just huge, boring list of commentary. These authors should not be acclaimed for throwing together a scrapbook of things that other people said. I COULD HAVE DONE IT MYSELF AND SAVED $26! The worst part of the book is looking at the pictures of the authors. They look duller than the book itself!"
positive,Excellent Condition/Service: The book came in excellent condition and I receive it within 5 days of purchase. Could not desire better service.
negative,Not Good as compared to same product at Any Other Store: These pampers are not good quality as compared to same brand product available on any other retailer store. The problem with these pampers are the poor absorption and also the velcora waist is not good quality. I would not recommend for future buy.
negative,"Are these really brand new? or just seconds?: I've used fusion blades for quite awhile, but these definitely were not as smooth/sharp as usual. They're mostly usable, but not as comfortable as normal. (I threw one away immediately.) I emailed the seller inquiring, but they did not reply."
negative,laughable.: worst piece of crap rage collection ever created. some of the songs they didnt even write. bad. not worth a star. dont buy it.
positive,"Tivo 2 dt: I just got the DT box to replace 2 tivo series boxes. Basically you get the same box with the excepttion of recording 2 shows. For me was better because now I pay only 1 bill insead for 2 boxes.But tivo has been very slow to release better boxes. If my cable company would have a better box that doesn't crash I'd be using it. Thee box has 2 tuners, HD, more space and etc...Tivo 2 dt is not worth it for new subscribers. But for returning tivo users then yes."
negative,"Wish I could give it 0 stars: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was absolutly stupid, boring, and a time-waster. The movie seemed to take forever and I couldn't wait for it to end. Plus, the ending was absolutely terrible and stupid. The main character in the story was such a bizzare character you really couldn't relate to her at all. The other characters were pretty weird too, but they were just funny. The special effects were OK, but it really annoyed me that those stupid statues kept coming to life to make the movie go on and on. There were so many many comedy aspects of this movie that it was hard to tell sometimes whether it was a comedy or a horror movie(such as the fact that all the characters had problems that were very obvious). I don't know about the old version of this movie, but the new one really sucks."
negative,"No Driver for the Windows XP Pro x64 Operating System: The LaserJet 1020 is a fine printer for use with older operating systems. It produces high quality output when attached to my Windows 98SE box. But it doesn't print at all when attached to my new computer with its XP Pro x64 operating system. The problem is there's no compatible driver available, not on HP's LaserJet 1020 installation disk and not on the HP website. I emailed HP Tech Support about the problem and they suggested two workarounds, using x64 drivers for other HP printer models, but neither worked. Tech Support now says to try working the problem via online chat. I'll try that next time I have a block of several hours free, unless I give the printer away first."
positive,"perfect fit: This sleeve fits the Apple MacBook Pro 15.4 inch perfectly, and it has fabric that protects the zipper from scratching your computer. This extra fabric does add a little extra room around your computer, but it's barely noticible (not like the InCase I had originally bought, which had about 3 inches of extra space!). Only reason I give it 4 stars is that it didn't come with the cord pouch like the other ones do, I think you have to buy that separately maybe. Other than that, it's the best sleeve I've found, and for someone that has tons of other bags but just needs extra protection for your laptop, this is the way to go."
positive,I like this book!: I like the book Castle In the Attic because it was very adventurous. My favorite part in the book was when Mrs.Philips gave William a gift. Do you know what the gift was? Can you figure out what it is? I recommend this book because Castle In the Attic is a very exciting novel to read.
positive,"I figured ""why not just give it a try?"": I was in London at the time that I read this book. I've always enjoyed Michael's books, especially this one. I really got a sense of where he got a lot of his story ideas. From the scuba adventures (Sphere) to the medical schooling (ER, Five Patients, many others), you can really see why he knows so much about the topics. When I was in London, I actually when to the London Psychics organization and had a reading myself. I can't say that it changed my life, but it was damn fun!! Enjoy the book!"
negative,"Read ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" Instead: I thought this book was, at best, lame. I have not before read Grisham's work, and expected a thriller, a page-turner, perhaps something similar to ""The Da Vinci Code."" What I got was a long, slow, tedious retelling of the trial portion of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" complete with the southern charm, token black woman, trashy white criminal, rape and murder. I had much higher expectations, and was keenly disappointed."
positive,"Rick Astley is underrated.: Rick Astley was never given the credit he deserved, he was certainly one of the better dance-pop artists to come out of the 80's. He was also very versatile - just listen to his version of ""When I Fall In Love"", a great cover version. He was certainly a blue-eyed soul singer, I think he rates right up there with Michael McDonald, who he even reminds me of, some. This disc showcases his best and best-loved songs. Highly recommended."
negative,"Very Dissappointed!: I bought these sheets because Consumer Reports rated them very highly. I have only had them for about 2 months and they have gone through about 4 washings. The thread count is suppose to be 330, but you wouldn't know it with the way it ""pills"". I have had 200 thread count sheets that didn't pill. If possible, I will be returning these."
positive,"A thouroughly enjoyable book: Even if this book was not written by a past President, it would be a great read. For an urban Yankee like me, this story of a rural Southern boyhood was fascinating. It's hard to imagine a boy who grew up barefoot and worrying about being able to handle a plow becoming President of the United States. His style is easy and warm. There are lots of interesting stories about share croppers, race relations, farming, and things I have no way of knowing about, thus it gave me an insight into a culture totally different from mine. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!"
negative,"skip the movie: If you enjoy a decent cast overwhelmed by unnecessary special effects, this is the film for you. The pleasure of Shirley Jackson's novel is its graceful understatement and its exacting psychological examination of fear. The film has neither of these virtures. Instead, it simply washes over one with all the subtlety of a large bucket of over-sweet jello."
negative,"an embarrassment: How did I get hoodwinked into wasting 2 hours in renting this movie?? Meryl Streep seems to wearing a mask, doing a SNL parodie of herself ""acting"" Jewish. Every bad cliche in the book, along with silly dialog, and shallow charactors are stuffed into this unfunny bore of a movie."
positive,"Behind the lighted stage: One always wondered what goes on behind the scenes. More than any other source, this movie tells that story. Great outtakes, good music clips and insight into the world of Rush.If you are a Rush fan, you need this movie!"
negative,steam escapes making the handles hot: The product is very poorly made. tried steaming some veggies and observed that steam escapes from the sides and hence the justification why many users gave poor reviews and warning about hot handles. do not recommend this product. Suprised to see A company very well known for quality products can make something very slimy.
negative,Rip Off BE CAREFUL: I purchased this and after the fact find out it cannot be streamed and isn't compatible with Mac products even though it clearly state it could be played on Apple. False advertising and a gimmick to get you to part with 1.99 for a movie and then not deliver. I will only watch free movies on here from now on. too much risk involved with purchases made one Amazon!!!
positive,"Delightful! Gripping!: This was a delightful and gripping read for a poor student of world history. Slowly I am putting together the pieces of the past and this book helped. It is vivid, compelling and hard to put down. As a mother of four, it was a wonderful escape. I would recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys the intrigue of human relationships and life's protocols during the Elizabethean era."
negative,This lipstick is orange-red. Very bright: I thought it would be a strong red color but its super bright orangey red. I use it as a stain. I would not purchase it again.
negative,"Ughh...: This movie is sick! Just the title of this flick gives me shivers. The plot: Woman goes on vacation. Gets repeatedly raped by mountain men for about 40 minutes. Then gets revenge in the last 40 minutes. I can't emphasize enough how utterly terrible this movie is. If you like movies with bad plots, bad acting and stupid characters this is your movie."
negative,"After Six Months It is Completely Frozen: Be very careful of this unit. After six months of pretty good use -- it simply froze with a ""Fatal Alert Error"", a hunk of junk. I can't do a soft or hard reset. I have followed all of Sony's included CD instructions. In fact, Sony's literature does NOT even mention ""Fatal Alerts."" My screen just flashes ""Palm Powered"" over and over. I have no idea what to do. I am giving up. Also, I had early problems with the date book synching, but I fixed those. (I still don't know how I did that.) Now it appears I cannot fix this thing. Money down the drain. I am not sure if it is a Sony problem or a Palm software problem. Either way, I will not buy a Sony or a Palm unit again."
negative,This book deserves negative 5 stars: This book is horrible. I've seen my dog deposit more original pieces of artwork on my lawn. I don't have anything else to say.
positive,"An old favorite: This was my introduction to Barbra in the 1960s and it holds its' own today. Just a great film, wonderful music and terrific costumes."
negative,"Rip Off: First, the DVD was produced in Germany, and you have your choice of the instructor speaking in his native German or dubbed into English. Second, the German-language menu works, but the English-language menu does not. The only way to navigate through the English version is to either fast forward or keep jumping to the next chapter. Third, this is not for beginners. I'm a beginner and I should know."
positive,Informative Resource...: Just had to take the time to commend the authors on a well done guide for those of us in or entering the field of wireless!! This is truly a resource!
negative,"Remember what good ol' Dr. Lecter used to say:: "" First principles, Clarice. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing ask: what is it in itself?""Answer on GLADIATOR: A turkey.P.S.: Richard Harris doesn't even look like Marcus Aurelius, but he sure resembles Ron Moody's Fagin in 'Oliver!' (see for yourself). Too bad director Scott didn't make this a musical!."
positive,"Book by Dale Carnegie: I read book Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking. It gave me practical skills to do my presentation in the right way. I defended my thesis on 29th of December 2010. Some professors said me, that it was interesting speech. The principle of effective learning is read and do as written. Moreover it allow me to raise my language skills in English, because this book is written in understandable way and I am Russian. Many thanks to author and people who produced this book. Danil from Tomsk, Siberia"
negative,Hogwash: None other than W. T. Sherman headed an investigation that absolved Forrest. Too many of the events described in gross detail never happened according to the official accounts and in many of cases denied by the participants themselves. Simply another effort to malign the record of the greatest cavalry commander of the War of Northern Aggression.
negative,"Waste of $15: I disassembled this thing for pieces, and the construction couldn't be cheaper. The steering is achieved with an electric motor, not a servo, so it's ""all or nothing""; not very much fun. I recommend either get something much more expensive, or something much less expensive."
negative,"Not Good: Too Expensive. 5- 1/2 cups are not true, you can barely make 3.5 cups. Every time you cook, you need to clean outlet also, that sucks. I don't recommend this product. You can do better with 1/3 rd of money what you spend on this product."
negative,"Terence Hill, Bud Spencer, Lionel Stander in the west.: Also known as Trinity Rides Again/ La Collina degli stivali.The print of this 1969 Italian western film is very poor. Grainy and greenish sometimes. Right away you will notice that Terence Hill and Lionel Stander (A Star Is Born [1937], Hart To Hart tv series [1979-84], Hart To Hart tv-movies [1993-96] ) have their voices dubbed by someone else. Sometimes you hear Stander's real voice. Stander plays a circus ringmaster. With his assistance he will help Terence and Bud Spencer take down the bad guys in the west. Difficult film to enjoy without Terence Hill's real voice. Victor Buono also in the film."
negative,"Disappointment on every page: I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead."
negative,"Does not fit: The case looks really nice and seems well made. But I never used it because the case seems backward for my TX. While the TX fits well into it, I can't access the stylus or the ports for synching and charging. If I put it in backwards the stylus and ports are accessible but I can't see the screen when I open it."
positive,"Effective communication: ""Clarity of writing usually follows clarity of thought. So think what you want to say, then say it as simply as possible.""Writing that works is your personal guide to cut through the noise and increase your odds of success in all forms of communication: drafting speeches, resumes, proposals, technical reports, and yes, even responding to email. True to its message, the book delivers a set of concise and invaluable tips."
negative,"The film left out significant characters: I noticed in this film that my favorite character Beourn was sadly left out. The film also jumped around alot. The goblins looked really pathetic, along with the woodland elves. It never explained how the dwarves got captured by the Woodland elves in the movie.But it was good I must say for an overall feeling and is great for younger Hobbit fans."
positive,"Very informative: I just returned from a month-long trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, and I found this book extremely useful for Cambodia. Not so much for hotel listings, etc., but for no-nonsense background information on Angkor, Phnomh Penh, and Siem Reap. The Vietnam portion was helpful as well, but I relied more on the Lonely Planet and Rough Guide Vietnam editions for that country. I would definitely recommend this book to someone traveling to Cambodia over the Lonely Planet edition, which is *really* outdated."
positive,"Under the Tuscan Sun: If you like romantic movies, this is the perfect one for you. But, please don't cry! It was a gift for someone else, eventhough I personally had seen it. It arrived just in time and I could keep track (via UPS) where it was, since I purchased it being in Puerto Rico."
positive,"Best Practice for Internal Med Shelf: This book is basically MKSAP 2 except with different questions. That's good since MKSAP 2 was well made. There were several things I liked about MKSAP. It covered a variety of illnesses and grouped them by symptom (so if you felt weak in pulmonary you could easily find sections applicable to that field). The American College of Physicians wrote it, which is quite comforting. It references appropriate research articles for every Q&A.; Finally, like a shelf, it forced you to make tough decisions. In reality, you order just above every lab and whatever imaging you need to cover yourself. Board questions, though, make you choose the best test from what you would always order.I preferred using the CD-ROM with the book (well made) as I could do questions much faster rather than flipping through a book.MKSAP 3 is slightly better than 2 in that it does reference more recent materials and protocols, and it seems to repeat certain concepts less."
negative,"The worst ever: This is absolutely the worst 17th century movie I have ever seen.Words cannot describe how much it revolted me.They could do a better job if they would not try to make a film at all.If halfway through the movie, the actors began to turn into lizards, it would not have surprised me.Controlling the urge to vomit was hard to say the least.As an armourer, reenactor, historian, and having studied the sword arts for more than two decades, I can honestly say that I believe in my own heart that Micky Mouse could have played the lead role and the little pigs could have been the Three Musketeers, which by the way, we do not even get to know the Musketeers in the movie, due to the focus being on superhuman acts of levitation and flight.But if you must watch it, please bear in mind that this movie is pure fantasy when it comes to any historical value and I would not recommend it even to children if you ever want them to learn ""real"" storylines, from ""real"" books, based on ""real"" history."
negative,Razor: This is not a good product (Gillette Fusion Razor) especially if you have a beard. The blade head is cumbersome and mine (I do not know if it is defective or not) squeaks. So for me new is not always better. I say DO NOT buy.
negative,not powerful enough.: I travel through the mountains each time I go to Florida. This antenna was not big enough to handle the hills and vallies.
positive,"Its OK: I perfer the other two books with Seraphim, and Gossaymer than I do this one. It's ok, it's not fantastic or all that spell binding but it's cute i suppose. Could have been better with more details, and even with more characters. But I think she's a good writer and I hope that her other books are just as good as the others I mentioned earlier."
negative,No essential at all.: I cannot believe this CD got Grammy award. Only value of this CD is the first and last track in which T-Bone plays the piano. I respect 40s' T-Bone Walker but not this one. This CD is just like tachno.
negative,Reviews for Paperboy: I was really disapointed in this game. It is quite boring. I bought it about three weeks ago and I really wish I hadn't got it. It does have some fun parts hawever but they don't occur very often. Overall I don't recommend this game.
positive,AWESOME!: I ordered for my son who doesn't like to read. Because of these books he is now a reader! Thanks so much!!!
positive,Perfect Classic: This dvd should be in every collection of great movies. We loved it the first time andactually re-watch in at least once a year. Good old fashion love story between man and pig.
positive,"Intriguing: I don't have a lot of deep things to say regarding this movie, except that it is VERY cleverly written. It pulled me in and by the middle of the movie, I was so enthralled that I had to see it all the way to the end. I was left asking myself at each point, ""Is this where she stops it?"" I also kept asking myself, ""How many times has she been through this?"" Again, a very cleverly written movie."
positive,"Cash is the best!: The Man in Black delivers the goods with this compilation of songs all dealing with the theme of murder. This is one of three or four with other themes. Cash has a style all his own that transcends being labeled ""country"" or ""blues"". The recordings are crisp and first rate and the liner notes fun to read."
positive,TiVo Wireless Adapter Works Great: I have been using TiVo with the TiVo Wireless USB Network Adapter for several months now and I haven't had any issues with this device. I was pleased to see the device work right from the start. I just plugged it in and TiVo recognized the device and started communicating with the TiVo servers.
positive,"Treasure Island: Treasure Island is about a boy, Jim Hawkins, who discovered a great treasure by means of a treasure map from an old seafaring man that stayed at his father's inn. With this map he sets off on a voyage with a crew picked by another sailor named Long John Silver, who is the cause of the trouble on the ship.A little while into the voyage, Jim hides in an apple barrel when some of the crew comes into the room he is in, and overhears that Silver has planned a mutiny. The captain and the loyal crew members must decide what to do about the mutiny and how to get the gold back without a ship.This is a classic adventure novel. It will keep you reading until you are done, and then you will want to read it again. I can't see how anyone would pass up the opportunity to read this great book."
negative,pist: I can't believe this movie wouldn't even play in my dvd player. Now after I already bought the movie I see in small letters that if says the movie won't play in most U.S. dvd players. So my question is why sell it in the U.S. then?
negative,"Quik Shade: I bought this to place on our deck for the summer season. We like to sit and read or have lunch without flying insects. It went up really easy and looked very nice. The bad part is, it won't work in the rain. The water collected on the edges and collapsed.We gave it away to a friend and told them it's only good in dry weather. We ordered another brand and it works perfect as an all around weather shelter.This unit is designed poorly, no support on the four sides they just collect in the rain. I should have read other reports on google before I purchased this unit. They all say the same thing."
negative,Horrible!!!: I hate that these diapers sag! My daughter weara them for about an hr and they are sagging and they leak. I will never buy these again! Going back to Luvs. No leaks or saggy diapers!
negative,"I guess my expectations were too high. Disappointed.: One of my favorite movies of all time is Braveheart and I had heard such glowing reviews of Gladiator and often comparisons to Braveheart that I couldn't wait to see it. I found it mostly boring. The storyline never caught me....I never felt for the character Russel Crowe played (though he was GREAT in the Insider). Joaquin Phoenix did make a pretty good ""bad guy"" but overall I was disappointed."
negative,"To Paraphrase Cordell Hull. . .: In all my years of viewing movies, never have I encountered a film laced with such infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge, that until today I never believed a studio was capable."
negative,"Bustin' Out was more fun -- this is a step backward: I bought this on the first day it was released. What a disappointment. It has less functionality than any Sims game -- as far as building or dressing people or aspirations or....well anything.The aspirations are stupid. For example, if your main character hires a maid that doesn't stop someone else in the house from wanting to hire a maid days later (even though the maid is walking around in front of their face!). How dumb is that!!The control panels are clunky. You have to pause the game to go find out when your character has to go to work or what they need to advance in their job. Plus, your PS2 will grind constantly and don't even get me to talking about the terribly slow load times!!Bustin' Out was way more fun -- more action and with a lighter sense of humor. Plus you can buy it cheap -- instead of this overpriced, uninspired mess."
negative,"A Great Disapontment: I purchased this book with great expectations. It is richly illustrated with rare photographs of obsolete aircraft soldiering on in an important area of operations. The writing and research was excellent, which I have come to expect from Mr. Hagedorn. However, one of these rare photographs depicted a nude strip-club dancer. Others depicted aircraft with explicit 'nose art'. When I read a military history book, it is my expectation that I (or my son) will not be subjected to objectionable photos. I returned the book for a refund. Sorry Dan."
negative,"0 stars: bad bad very bad.It's not rapid, and it does nothing for acne, it doesn't even moisturize. I used it religiously for at least 2 weeks. Nothing. I ended up throwing it away.Don't buy any of the rapid clear products from Neutrogena is all I can say."
positive,"Super cool crochet: With patterns like Lil' Monkey baby hat and blanket (based off sock monkeys), anarchy irony hat, and bedfellow animals who wouldn't want this? The patterns are fine and every project is fun to make."
negative,"not worth it: do not buy these shirts, not worth the money, certainly not worth bill blass label, very poor style and stitching and fabric."
negative,Chibi Vampire Review: This CD is not the music but a Drama CD. It basically has skits from the anime on it.Karin
negative,"Terrible deceit: The jacket cover write-up of this book leads one to believe it is a courtroom thriller, like other Grisham novels. In fact it is not. It is a very slow-paced story of a newspaper in a sleepy little town. If Grisham really had faith in this story he should have hyped it for what it is and drawn an audience with its eyes open, rather than using deceit to lure unsuspecting readers to their 400 page, excruciatingly tiny-printed doom."
negative,Wrong item sent: I ordered a 2m USB download cable for a Nikon Coolpix Model 4600 digital camera. The item that arrived had the wrong connector for my camera which made it worthless for me. The item cost about $5 and I didn't think it was worth the time to send it back.
positive,5 Plug Surge Protector: Arrived on time and was exactly as promised.Saving me from all those wires from theother surge protector!
negative,"Not Mac Compatible, broke before printing a few thousand pages: This printer, though mostly functional when connected to a Windows box, did not work without significant amounts of effort when connected to a Mac. Customer support at HP was not helpful in resolving my Mac connectivity issues. I eventually got it working with some 3rd party tools, but then the printer power supply died. I called HP customer support again and was told to buy a new HP printer.Needless to say, this is the last HP printer I will own. I suggest looking at some of the Brother models instead."
negative,"Slight, predictable romantic comedy: A government official (Cary Grant) tries to reconnect with his children (Mimi Gibson, Paul Petersen, and Charles Herbert) after the death of his wife. The daughter of a symphony conductor (Sophia Loren) goes on the run to escape her overbearing father (Eduardo Ciannelli) and takes a job as nanny to the children. Romantic comedy ensues.If there is any reason to watch this film, it is the chemistry between Grant and Loren, who had been in a real life relationship not long before filming began. The situation, however, is highly contrived and the scriptwriters (Melville Shavelson and Jack Rose) are all too willing to cast all logic aside for the sake of some rather slight gags. Characters do not behave in a consistent fashion, their personalities changing as the script requires so that the story can hit every predictable plot point on the way to its happy ending."
negative,"The pits: A complete waste of film start to finish.Don't waste your money.If you must see it for yourself, rent it.This movie didn't need a remake, the original starring James Caan was just fine.One star is generous."
positive,Good value: These bungee cords are a good value because of the multiple sizes which are color coded. They are as described and will serve the purpose for which they were obtained.
negative,"copy cat: I think the book is to much like the lord of the rings with descriptions of people and places and i dont think its orginal at all.Its the same by having the character vunrable at the begin not nowing there true strength eg.Frodo,eragon.And also Brom and Gandalf are the same sort of character.The Elves and the dwarfs have the same description as in lord of the ring and the languages and names are the same.Also the Razac are like the ringwraiths hissing and black hooded.He also talks about the Evles coming other on ships and living in a forest that no one apart from the evles have travelled in without not coming out,that is also the same.I could sit here all day and compare both stories so iam just going to say all in all a very poor reflection of a really good story by J.R Tolkein."
positive,"One of the greatest works i've ever read!!: John Steinbeck captures the sensitive relationship of two close men very well. His portrayel of both men leave space to form your own opinion. Steinbeck's works are not so pulled tightly together that you can't take time to figure out the story, but he does like to mess around with words, which makes his writing so interesting! A perfect piece for any articulate reader!"
negative,"Do not buy if you have XP: I downloaded XP driver from their website and patch also. Now XP doesnot complain about new hardware but I dont see ANYTHing on my camera. I dont know whats the problem. It run very well on my old PC but does not work on new one that has XP. SO as I changed my PC , i will have to go buy some other new webcam now."
positive,"Outstanding!: The producers of this film have done a wonderful job of taking a Broadway play, and converting it to the cinema! My only complaint is that it is not listed on the list of DTS DVD's at Amazon! The DTS encoding was pure genius! I hope that this DVD lasts long enough for my children to watch it. I can't wait to watch it again! Go Go GO Joseph!"
negative,"Unless your kids are over 12, leave them home with Grandma: There is nothing, I repeat, NOTHING in Italy that would appeal to a child under the age of 12. This book is a waste of money. If your kids are under 12, take them to Disneyland/World and save yourself a lot of money and whining."
positive,"Tremors? More like yawns: Don't get me wrong. I also loved this movie the first five times I saw it. It's a real cult classic. The small desert town of Perfection is attacked by large, underground monsters. AND THEY EAT PEOPLE. And no, it's not really a horror movie. It's more like a comic show. If you liked ""Ghostbusters"", ""Evolution"" or ""The Blob"", you'll gonna love this one.However, I have to admit that I've outgrown this movie. These days, I just yawn when I see it. Usually, I don't even watch the reruns. ""Yeah, yeah, there's a monster beneath the hardware store. Whatever"".For old times sake, however, I'll give it five stars anyway. BTW, did you know that smorgasbord is a Swedish loanword?"
negative,"Bulky camera: I got this camera for free with miles that were going to expire. Compared to what is out there, it is huge! I do like the folding viewer as it won't get scratched, but now a days you can buy the plastic covers for the viewers to avoid that.Needless to say, I'm still using it on vacations and will only buy a new one when this dies or breaks."
positive,Great product: Bought this DVD after this was stolen from our house. This came brand new and sealed wrapper just like buying at the store. Excellent price. It makes a great replacement added to our family movie collection. No problems or issues with purchasing this product.
positive,Great value: I have three of these mattresses. They are much longer lasting and more sturdy than other brands I have purchased. They are very comfortable.I highly recommend this product.
positive,"EXCELENT!!!: It's just fantastic, an adventure full of emotions and wonderful landscapes. These series have given to humanity a great gift. Thanks a lot Ms. Auel. I hope you will continue the Ayla's story. I've been waiting for years to continue the story, I'm sure you have too much to write. When the next book will be coming out?. Every time I go to a bookstore I look for the next one."
negative,"What I Know: This Book is Literary Torture: I read about halfway through this book, and then I gave up. I read James' ""Turn of the Screw,"" and ""Daisy Miller"" in high school, and I remember liking the former and thinking the latter was just okay. (I know, I know, it's a major classic by one of America's most celebrated writers, but just because something has merit doesn't mean I like it better.) One of my all time favorite books was James' ""Washington Square."" It's hard for me to believe that the same man wrote ""Square"" and ""Maisie."" This book is only for MAJOR Henry James enthusiasts."
positive,"Excellent Text for the Intro. Level: The text is excellent and is suitable for any type of introductary Ecnonomics class. It can be used in a tough course or an easy course, as it provides a great level of organization so that the instructor may choose the material at his discretion depending on his course lay out."
negative,"A Start !: This book is a very immature guide. The editing is quite poor too. However if all you want is a fast introduction, this book just might help; please don't mind the headache at the end of the day."
negative,"boring: The woman in this video is so boring, the information was good but I literally fell asleep while playing this video. Video quality is also very low, made in the 70's, if that. There are far better lessons out there. Keep looking."
negative,"Men's heatgear compression shortsleeve T-shirt: I did not expect this top to be skin tight. The other Armour exercise shirt I have is a comfortable fit. It is partly my own fault because I did not realize the significance of ""compression"" fit."
negative,"The worst casebook I have ever used.: I think my title sums it up. If you are a professor deciding on a book to use for your class, PLEASE do not use this one. Thank you."
negative,"Interesting world, claustrophobic writing: While I don't regret purchasing this book, I found the writing style very claustrophobic. It was sometimes unclear what was happening and how everything worked. The drawback to such a finely detailed world is that it's difficult for the author to introduce all the content we need to know in an interesting way. I found the characters actions somewhat unrealistic, perhaps because I didn't know enough about the class and race dynamics involved. The author is a perfectly competent writer, but I just didn't like her style. I'd recommend reading excerpts before buying to see if you have the same reaction."
negative,"Good idea, needs LOTS of work: The set up is real easy, the site is too flashy (no pun intended) and the play lists are never updated. I have NO idea what the other people who give this good reviews are thinking. I live in NYC, media capital of the world, and if it doesn't work here with hip-hop and Latin stations, it won't work anywhere. If you r into Latin music the site tells you the stations are supported but when you mark a song it gives you the popular songs not necessarily the songs playing. It is very unreliable, I have yet to see it work more than 3 times, and I have owned it for well over a month. If you want to get it, DON'T. At least wait until they start working on getting the play list on point."
positive,"an excellent comosition: this was a great effort by th BEATLES, from magical mystery tour to all you need is love. The best song was cleary I AM THE WALRUS.(the walrus was paul)"
negative,"Don't buy used!: Purchased this used game for my niece for Christmas. Turns out this game is like a one-time-use deal. A lot of the tasks were already done and she couldn't name her own dog, or delete and start over. What a rip! Ended up getting her a brand new game."
negative,earings: Earings are too big...no way of knowing they were as big as they are...nothing i will wear....
negative,"Loaded with fallacious logic: I read the book with interest and an open mind. The conclusions the author makes are often unfounded. There are some interesting historical descriptions and the most important contribution of the book was to depict that K was actually a human - and in my mind that made him even greater, because being a human he understood the human condition. But the author appears to constantly want to attack K for being a human and many of her conclusions seem to be inaccurate and unfounded - at least they are not presented with much solid logic."
positive,"A New Appreciation of Blanche DuBois: Upon a recommendation, I read the stage play after watching the movie with Vivian Leigh.Sure, she is neurotic, but she suffered many losses. One loss from which she was unable to recover was the suicide of her young husband. The play specified the reason for his suicide, that could not be revealed in the 1951 movie. To me, it explained her promiscuity, because she needed to be constantly reassured of her attractiveness."
negative,I HATE IT: OUR TEACHER MRS GREEN MADE US READ IT AND WE HAD TO DO A BOOK REPORT ABOUT IT!IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!
positive,Sick and twisted is good...: This book is sick. It is twisted. It is not for the faint of heart. It is PERFECT for vampire.
negative,Very small and cheap: I was not expecting much from this jacket at this price and still it was dissapointing when I saw this thing. It says it fits the average size adult more like the average size 10 year old. It is poorly made if you are looking for a life jacket to actually use or have for someone else to use I would not suggest this item. If you are just looking for something to fill your boat and meet the appropriate number of vest to match your passengers hope if you do need to use this jacket there is someone who weighs less than a hundred pounds on your boat so this jacket can be helpful.
positive,"Great Buy: I read the whole play in one day. It isn't quite as good as the musical, but anyone who likes the music will enjoy the play as well."
positive,GREAT SHIRTS: ALL SIX OF THE GILDEN SPORT SHIRTS ARE AN EXCELLENT EDITION TO MY ENTIRE WARDROBE COLLECTION
positive,"As the crowe flies....: Russell Crowe stars as a general who is set to become king. He is betrayed by the dying king's son, who kills his father(The King!) before word is told to the population that Crowe is to be king. All sorts of bad things happen to Crowe, who is sold to a merchant to become a gladiator. A great ensambel cast rounds out this incredible battle of heart and spirit vs. evil and jealousy! Get it on blue-ray and cheer on Crowe in all of his battles to the end. Highly recommended!"
positive,2.1 PC speaker: works well with any player but you will need a female adaptor. Good product for its price.
negative,"High-school drama in disguise: I enjoyed the descriptions of daily life in an Indian village. Other than that, this book had a lot to dislike. For starters, the language was too contrived: ""...she let him grope the curves of her breasts and tease the nubs into nibbly nuts..."" ""Then in Bhasi's eyes, Mukundan saw the star he had sought in the heavens shine and burn"". The storyline was equally aggravating. This could have easily been the plot of a high-school movie: newcomer (Mukundan) is scared and wants nothing more than belong. He makes friends with a dweeb (Bhasi), who is genuinely concerned about him. He finds true love (Anjana). But when the ""in"" clique starts paying attention to the newcomer, he mistreats those who care about him. Through a series of events, he eventually realizes what a rat he's been and makes ammends.Honestly, i'd rather watch or read the high-school version!"
negative,"Unfulfilled: I listened to this one on tape. The reader was perfect for the part. The story, however, left me high and dry. I felt like I'd fallen asleep and missed the part where he avenges his wife. Maybe I did. This was a depressing story for the most part but done by a talented writer. Too bad it seemed to stop instead of end. Loose ends left blowing in the wind all over the place."
positive,"CORRUPTION--ITALIAN STYLE: This Damiano Damiani policier seems to fly beneath the radar of critical attention. It doesn't say anything new really, but it says it a very stylish way. The duel of wits between Franco Nero's straight-arrow (and slightly priggish) prosecutor and Martin Balsam's fed-up cop is entertainly presented, and although the denouement is predictable, it really couldn't happen any other way. Marilu Tolo also does a nice job as a reluctant witness who scared to death for very good reasons.""Confessions of a Police Captain"" is no masterpiece, but it's the sort of solid workman-like entry that makes the study of film genres so very entertaining."
positive,Waiting for it: did a pre order and it is on its way..i am sure it is as good as season 1. Want to get this viewed so i will be OK for season 3 to start.
positive,"Best fit for thick premium mattresses: Extremely satisfied with the fit, feel and quality of these sheets. I have a high king-size mattress -- 18 inches -- and these Sealy sheets have provided the best fit of all that I have tried. They feel luxurious, too, and I especially like the oversized top sheet."
negative,loud and terrifying: This product was awful. It was so loud my pregnant neighbor thought the boiler in our building was going to blow up. It almost scared her into labor! I couldn't use it!
negative,Poorly Made: What a disappointment. I can't believe how cheaply made this book is. I am glad I got in on sell or I would have returned it. The caring case is a zip lock bag. The pages can be easily ripped off. The pages are not plain paper and you put a mental page behind the story page. I could have do this on my own with the cheaper and FULL version of this book. The Magnet letters are VERY tiny. It really wasn't even worth the sell price. I'm a home daycare provider and I really feel ripped off. Shame on the makers of this book. The are some wonderfully made Magnet learning books by Top That! Including Counting with Magnetic Numbers (Magnetic Play and Learn) I wish I got more of these books instead
negative,"A pitiful excuse for a movie: If you want to see a movie of Moby Dick, see the John Huston directed version, with screenplay by Ray Bradbury. This pitiful excuse for a movie was made by people who had no knowledge of New England, whaling, whales, or Herman Melville's epic novel. The grand poetry, the vivid imagery, the theological symbolism which fill ""Moby Dick"" are all missing in this shell of a film. Even Stewart's performance is a disappointment--Khan in Star Trek II does a better job of spouting Ahab's venom than Stewart's anemic portrayal.The additions to the story are meaningless (Chinese harpooners, Queequeg's ""BLAH!"" noises,Ahab's family)...and the omissions are puzzling (Elijah).And the rubber whale--who is unscarred, unmarked by corkscrew harpoons, ungrizzled, unbarnacled, with no flight of gulls--well, he looks like a rubber whale."
positive,Interesting!: See my review of book #3 . . . I found this to be a very interesting series. Sorry it didn't have more books in it!
positive,"Dawn of a new synthpop: Maybe it's because drum machine and sampler technology caught up with them...or maybe that Martin was in an especially sultry mood. Masses marks the moment Depeche Mode really find their second incarnation, consolidating the successes of Black Celebration, moving from industrial clang to sultry slink. Thank god for the Emulator and digital synths, because the boys put them to very good effect here. And David Bascombe's production rounds out a great collection of thematically connected songs. (They're all about the sex drive and its dull motivations, boys and girls). The only thing more impressive would be what follows: an astonishingly perfect synthpop album...or is it rock album?...called Violator."
negative,"Screw the Environment: This product just shows how lazy people have become and just haw ignorant and uncaring people are of the environment. It really is sad. Every serving of poor coffee/hot chocolate/etc required you to throw away a small plastic cup that cannot be recycled and will never break down. That is millions of these lille waste bombs a day!! If you can live with yourself for that, you obviously do not care about the planet or anyone living on it."
negative,"Beware of this phone ...bad antenna on most: Keys not designed for adult human use... volume buttons on side where a person usually holds the phone will set off rings/noises usually at an awkward time.LG also knows there is a problem with the antenna on most of these phones. They started replacing the stock antenna with a better(""red"") antenna, but they didn't get to a lot of them, especially the ""free"" ones they give you at Cingular.You have to call ""Warranty Service"" to get the new ""red"" antenna to get service without mega cutoffs. --If you live in an apartment; DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PHONE! -- And good luck on a speedy finding of where the earphone/mike handless plug is.."
positive,"A Very Suspenseful Book!: This book not only kept me reading and reading, it also was suspenseful and thrilling. Emily was a truly wonderful character and all of the other characters had colorful personalities as well. If you like suspense and romance too, get this book today! You'll absolutely love it."
positive,"Loved this Harlem Globetrotter story when I was in 8th grade: Been 30 some-odd years, but this book inspired me to play basketball when I was in school. Definitely had an impact, and I remebered the book but not the title, till yesterday I found my 8th grade journal and I had written excitedly that my book had arrived (shcolastic books) ""Go, Man, Go!""It Chronicles the story of the Harlem Globetrotters, how they got their start, how they improved, and how they forever changed the game. Now I am ordering a copy for my kids. I cannot say if this is a book adults would enjoy, but I loved it as a kid."
positive,"My cat loves these: Xena, my tabby, is a very finiky eater, and she loves this product. She gets three every night before I go to bed, and she will sit at the pantry, waiting for her bedtime treat."
positive,Customer service: The item is excellent and that was exspected and it resolved the issue. But the seller is very customer focused. Thanks
positive,"A Great Read and Adventure: Being 24, I have to admit I loved this book. There is a youthful energy about it. Once I started reading Ihad to finish. The young writer who wrote this is defenitly one to keep a eye on. It was fun, kept a brisk pace. Is it predictable, yes and no. But it doesnt hurt it whatso ever. You can tell the writer drew upon several influences. There are shades of Star Wars and Lord of the rings butits great. Loving all those books and films makes this read even better and shows that you can put temporary influences into a book and make it refreshing. A MUst Read"
positive,"AMAZING series: I have difficulty putting into words just how much each of the Earth's Children books have transformed my way of thinking. Auel's ability to create characters who use our natural resources for the greatest good has strong appeal. Each book has spun a world of reality-based fantasy which can guide how we see the world today. The world of Ayla, the Clan, and the Others is one in which EVERYONE should enter... and decide to stay."
negative,"Um, this CD pretty much stunk...: I bought this CD cuz of the song ""Sledgehammer,"" and I was really dissapointed when I found out that the rest of the CD wasn't good at all. Song after song, it was so boring listening to."
positive,"What does the Government have to hide?: A very informative explanation of a tragic event in America's history. The Author tells of the events that led up to the attack and the horrific aftermath of it. The book tries to tell of the reasons for the attack, although we may never know. Why did the US Government and Israel cover up this terrible event, could the truth be so terrible that the American people would forever distrust the government?The Author makes us realize that if the truth is so terrible, it can be covered up and hidden from us. A call for a Congressional investigation that is honest and truthful is called for and should be undertaken so tragic events like this will never again occur in America's or Israel's history.A great military book and exciting history. Should be a movie!"
negative,"THIS IS AN EXTREMELY PERVERSE MOVIE!!!!!!: I rented this movie about a year ago and it was so disturbing I had to cut it off! I have watched a lot of bad movies in my lifetime but this sick twisted film took the cake. I love shocking horror movies and always have, but this movie was too much even for me! And if I can't make myself watch it, then IT'S GOT TO BE REALLY BAD!!! Whoever made this distasteful movie needs help! And anyone who can sit down and enjoy watching this crap should get help-------AND FAST!!! I didn't even watch all of it, it was that damn distasteful!!! The story focuses on an innocent gal who is relentlessly attacked and raped numerous times by a gang of perverts-----one of whom is retarded. After raping her, they leave her lying nakad in her cabin. They think she's dead, but she's not and stalks them and kills them off one by one in gruesome ways. Don't buy this B.S. Don't even rent it, unless you're as perverse as this movie is!!!"
negative,"Disappointed: When ordering this book I thought I was going to get instruction on how to write a screenplay with format, what I did recieve is how to put an idea on paper of which I already have done. Disappointed in Scottsdale!"
negative,"Terrible: This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart."
negative,Dorman HELP! 38419 Door Hinge Pin and Bushing Kit: I ordered 2 of these door hinge pin kits which include the bushings and clip. One package came taped up. Today I was preparing to install these door pins I noticed the black clip was missing from the taped up package. I ran to 2 different hardware stores to find a clip. Neither store had this item.I had to halt my installation today and will run to an auto parts store to buy a whole new kit so I can get the installation done.There is no contact for the seller so I will now have to eat my cost on this kit. Plus it's much cheaper at the auto parts store.
negative,"Worthless: I bought this book when it was first printed hoping for some insight into how Tomcat worked, design decisions, architecture etc. etc.What I got was nothing more than a rehash of the online documentation.A complete waste of money then and utterly worthless now. If you have a copy hang it on a nail."
positive,I great fun book on dimesions it explains everything .: I great fun book on dimesions it explains everything even for someone in 4th grade it is a very good book.
positive,"A Family Story: This was the Sleeper for 2009 and did not receive much if any acclaim. My wife and I truly appreciated this movie and highly recommend it. I have requested that my children, both of whom live out of state, take the time to watch and listen to this story.I am, and have always been, a Robert DeNiro fan.Hoping that you enjoy it as much as we did."
negative,"game issues: Amazon was fast with sending my game to me. I love these games, but the game itself has many issues. The video is really bad. It's not my video card my husband has checked to make sure of that. I have just about every other Law and Order games and also CSI ones. They are the best."
positive,"Wow: My class could do this for an extra credit grad and I am glad about that. This book is frightening realistic. The technology in this is possibly and some of its here, the government has come and gone in a lesser degree, and the issues faced are here. If someone with enough brains and had a hated enemy of the people, this government may come. The story is very believable and is a must read for casual and serious readers alike."
negative,"Unconvincing: Science is about making deductions from factual evidence. It has no means of explaining anything that is supernatural.However, religion requires the belief in supernatural forces and at least one supernatural being.That DOES NOT mean religion is wrong, it just means it is a different subject matter than science and therefore DOES NOT belong in a science classroom.You wouldn't expect English literature, music, history and other such subjects to be taught in a science classroom. Neither should religious beliefs. I, for one, am perfectly happy to have my religious beliefs kept out of science classrooms. I don't need science to tell me there is a God. I don't need - or want - my religious beliefs to force science to be conducted in a certain way. Quite frankly, anyone who feel that the honest teaching of science is a threat to their religious beliefs is someone who has great doubts about their religious beliefs!"
positive,"A good book for kids with disabilities: Sometimes it is hard to find parables for children who have disabilities. The stories about Jesus focus on wholeness and wonderfulness. In this fable, the crippled lamb is left behind when the others go out to pasture. He feels lost and left behind until a special couple shows up. It is then that he has the chance to do the one thing the other sheep could not, he curls up to the infant and warms him in the cold stable.This is written in a style that even the youngest can understand. Highly recommended, particularly to families and Sunday school classes with children who are ""different."""
positive,This movie is Funny: I really liked the part when John Candy was at the firing range. This movie is one of Candy's greatest.
negative,"Almost a must-rent (hint: don't bother buying): I'm neutral to Mel Gibson. He's getting old. The movie wasn't acted all that great, but it did have some humor. It's almost a must-rent, but not quite. I wish I'd rented something else, but at least now I can say I've seen the movie, and that I'm truly traumatized by seeing Mel Gibson dressed up like a woman. *shudder*"
positive,Red Door gift Set: This was a gift for my daughter. She loves Red Door & loved this set. I would recommend it.
positive,"Great for arthritic hands!: These holders have saved my Canasta game! I thought that I would have to give up card playing when the arthritis in my hands became so painful, but these sturdy little holders saved the day. Very easy to use."
negative,"The Last Juror is Low-fat, Salt-free Grisham: ""The Last Juror"" - what a disappointment. It started out as such a promising grabber - only to fizzle into a frustrating bore. The character development was lame and where the heck was the plot? When reading Grisham's earlier books, I loved being ""taken away""; after reading this book, I just feel ""taken"".As a Legal Aid lawyer, and having lived in a small southern city, I applaud Mr. Grisham's adroit handling of complex racial and social issues in previous books. In ""The Last Juror"", the character development and plot did not go far enough to either deal effectively with issues or entertain. I'd like to see Grisham take the same characters and write a sequel that has some bite.Please, Mr. Grisham, give us something rich and complex that we can sink our teeth into and then savor long after reading that last page."
negative,"Terrible book, poor editing: This feels like Grisham's attempt to write Southern literature, rather than suspense fiction. The entire book feels like a feeble attempt to imitate Harper Lee. Don't let the book jacket fool you, a full 1/3 of the book cover stuff that isn't related to the trial at all.The editing is also poor. Once he used the same exact descriptive sentence in two different places in the novel. In another, he describes a young man wants to be a draft dodger but is convinced to go to Vietnam by his parents. Less than 10 pages later Grisham writes that the parents begged their son not to go.The entire plot is a let down. There is no suspense, the ""surprise ending"" meager and predictable, and Grisham wastes half the novel writing about utter non-sense that is not related to the story and is not charming."
positive,"Sci Fi Nightmare!: Despite not being that familiar with Sci-Fi literature, I am learning to love it. In this book, Bradbury creates a powerful, disturbing imagery to ilustrate his distopia, which has bone-chilling similarities with our days. A must-read, even for those who are not Sci-Fi lovers. Why didn't I five-stared? Well, I didn't like the style so much, it could be more concise. Someone said that writing is the art of eliminating words, rather than adding them."
negative,"Misleading Title - Worst book ever on Henry VIII: This book was extremely disappointing, especially for a person well read in Tudor History. The title is very misleading. I thought this book would examine in depth the final years of Henry's reign. Theses final years were full of scandal, intrigue and death but the book read like a summary of his whole reign. There are plenty of other books that do this and do it better (Alison Weir for example). It's pages and pages of he said, she said quotes followed by summaries of crucial events that surely deserve more description. If you are looking for a thorough historical analysis of the final years of Henry, save your money."
positive,What an eye-opener: This book was a huge learning for me! I understand myself and my gifts more fully and I am using it daily in my coaching practice! I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.
positive,"I'm going nuts!: PPLLEEAASSEE HURRY UP! I read this book when I was in grade 5, am now in grade 8 and have read it 5 times since then! Okay, so I'm a literiture junkie. I have read the whole series twice and have thought about the fifth book for so long that I think I could write it myself!"
positive,"Scarier than LIFE: Learning to appreciate everything around us is difficult, in today's society. We have everything ever dreamed of, and we have barely begun. By letting ""..451"" into you're mind, one realizes that this fiction, is not justly so. It is apparent in our realm that this fable has already begun to happen. Change is something not always noticed. However, this book opened my eye's to to the world around me. I am certain, that ""Guy Montag"" the charachter, is in all of us. Just waiting to be discovered."
negative,The Bat Has Lost It: In This Batman Was Not Very Good Maybe it was because the villian was an idiot with a moth mask on and gased everyone to see ilussions hopefully the next batman with the joker as the villian will be better i heard it comes out june 2007 with spiderman 3 and superman
negative,"trash masquerading as art: Don't waste your precicous time on this pretentious tripe. The acting is self-conciously artsy and overwrought. Brando's character is an abusive jerk, while Schneider's character just can't get enough of it. Spare me the nonsense please! If nudity is your bag, rent a Playboy video instead; you'll thank me for keeping you from losing 2 hours with this mess."
positive,GREAT!!!!!!: One of the most fact filled books I have read on the REDHEAD topic.Being a redhead myself I love learing about my strands of copper.
positive,"Great way to get (almost) all of Lewis' classics: I love that many of my favorite books by Lewis are availible in a convenient package. While I would have liked to have The Four Loves in here as well, I think this is a great collection that I am happy to own."
positive,"EXQUISITE!!!!!: It's the absolute best book someone could buy. It has magic, dragons and a bunch o' cool stuff. I think it's the best book ever!!!"
positive,"Excellent review for our present members of congress and anyone with the interest to put in the time.: This is very interesting about Montesquieu. Every member of congress should read it and take it to heart. It appears that the majority of our founding fathers did read it and take it very seriously. It is something that all Americans who are interested in our government should consider reading. It is amazingly quite easy to read though, I would suggest having a good dictionary handy while reading it. Some of our members of congress I just do not believe would understand, even if someone was reading the dictionary for them. That is a sad commentary about the facts we all must face, however."
positive,"An Alternative Entertaining Experience: I bought this DVD, hoping to enjoy a gay themed movie that wasn't a ""B"", with all the movies out there, this is one of the better made. The acting wasn't bad, and the movie did a great job of holding my attention. Its not your typical gay movie style, but I am happy to have this in my collection."
negative,"Bergman is a bad director: Bergman is a terrible director. All of his movies have horrible dialog and next to no story. He rarely has a resolution to what little story he does provide. Most of his films just force symbolism down your throat like so much tripe. I don't understand how he became world famous. Persona is especially the case, the only good thing about this film is the cinimatography, which alone does not make a good movie."
negative,"What happened to this man?: I previewed this album, and although some of the songs are pretty off the hook, I really have to ask: What happened to this man?I remember first hearing him sing on an episode of his big sister's hit sitcom ""Moesha"" about 10 years ago, and he was terrific. Fast-forward to 2005, and I hear ""One Wish."" He whined and cried his way through the entire song.Although the songs are pretty good, his voice has just deteriorated some how. I'm not sure what happened."
negative,"second cd's are no good: I ordered Magical Mystery Tour at a second-hand price. After a minimal amount of playing, it became useless. Unplayable. I will never do this again."
positive,"Fantastic and awe inspiring: I read both books, The Cross and the Switchblade and ""Run Baby Run"" when I was a teen. I had copies of both books and lost them. I now have teens of my own and would like to get copies of them. any ideas on where I can pick them up. at a retail store in Macon, Ga. I have no way way of paying for them online and as a single mother I sometimes have a hard time coming up with the money anyway."
positive,Wonderful Book: This is probably one of the best books that I have ever read on the people of Israel! I couldn't put it down. I found that the honesty and realness of the people was astounding. I reccommend it to anyone and everyone who wants to understand the Israeli people.
negative,"Stay away from this unit!: This media player is great.... when it works, which is rarely! I have had this product for over a year now and have had nothing but problems with it. The only way I got acceptable performance (meaning it doesn't lock up on me) is by ditching the wireless connection and going with a hardwired setup. I tried two different wireless routers, but the router didn't seem to be the problem. I also ditched the server software, which would hammer my machine, and went with Tversity instead. After all of that, it was finally working well, until all of a sudden it died completely. Since I've had it for over a year, DLink tech support and customer service said too bad. Their only solution was to offer to sell me another unit - I don't think so!"
positive,"Romantic entertainment: We enjoy Jane Austin novels and thought this would be worth having. The performance level is good, not great, but it is fun and very entertaining for Jane Austin fans."
negative,"xXxtremely Awful: This could have been a Patrick Swayzee flick made for the USA Network. Vin Diesel does what he can with what little he's got to work with here, but he's a star who deserves a much better vehicle than this. Cheesey as can be, bad, no, HORRIBLE acting and worst of all... very mean spirited. At one point, the villans turn on a group of scientists who've made a toxic nerve gas for them and from behind the safety of a thick, glass wall, use that weapon to kill the scientists and mock their deaths, pretending to choke and gag and plead for help while laughing at the dying victims. It's unbelievably sadistic and violent for a PG-13 movie.....On a positive note though, the soundtrack is awesome. Seriously."
positive,The best: My son's skin sensitivity works great with Pampers. A great brand and a great loyalty to the brand has been our families opinion. We will always recommend Pampers.
negative,"beer bands: Although a cute addition to the party, they didn't last long. After stretching over a can or bottle for 2 days of our 4 day weekend party, some of them fell apart. I like the idea and needed something like this for a large group."
positive,"Clever. Well acted. Well shot.: Enjoyed this quite a bit. Good performances. Very well shot. And best of all, a script with some real thought put into the story. The filmmakers really bring you something you've never seen before. It also has several WOW moments. No spoilers here. Just watch it."
negative,did not save best for last: The movie is really sorry.It just doesn't make sense. Plot doesn't flow. It is like it hade been wrote by third graders. However the special effects are good. Rent it first and you will not buy it
negative,"Really disappointed: After listening to Andreas Bocelli and Eros Ramazzotti, I was looking forward to adding more Italian pop to my collection. I had heard Zucchero's duet with Andreas and thought I would be happy with this CD. Nope. One or two songs were ok, but overall I did not enjoy it. Unfortunately, it's headed to my ""mistake"" CD pile."
positive,"An Often Overlooked Classic: The French Connection has never seemed to generate as much buzz as other Best Picture Winners, and is likely to be overlooked yet again in its DVD release, coming so close to the Godfather Trilogy and Citizen Kane. The exception is the chase, of course, long celebrated as perhaps the best ever captured on film. In addition to the action elements, however, there are other reasons to add this to your collection, including Gene Hackman's fine, Oscar-winning turn as Popeye Doyle and William Friedkin's energetic direction. French Connection II suffers somewhat by comparison - Hackman is still great, but the movie seems to lack cohesion, as if the writers patched the story together scene by scene, rather than knowing their destination. It is not a bad movie by any means, but certainly not the classic its predecessor is. The bonus materials are nicely presented and pretty interesting, for the most part - a solid, if not particularly spectacular, package."
negative,"midway ,midway forgotten: Looks like they forgot to include the other hour and fifty minutes of the COLLECTORS EDITION !The sound is mono...yes mono!They forgot the movie portrays history!They also forgot that this is cinematic history as well.For years,I enjoyed watching this movie with my dad and brothers.It was one of the few subjects my dad and I could talk about for hours.Universal has short changed everyone looking to buy the four hour version.I hope they see the error of their ways by the poor sales of this version and begin to re-store the long sought after four hour version on dvd....they owe it to the veterans(of which,I am one),and history buffs."
negative,"rip off of the beatles: what the hell is this. 5 loosers from enlgand trying to copy the beatles. i mean even there fans are so stuipid. i read one review which one of the oasis fans criticized thebeatles for being a rip off of OASIS. hello dude the beatles were 1963 and oasis is 1994. that should be enough to skip this album and get hte better of these clones THE BEATLES.r.i.P. JOHN LENNON, GEORGE HARRISONTHEY MUST BE TURNING IN THERE GRAVES"
positive,Purchased this for my 21 month old and she loves it.: The giggles never stop. She never get tired of playing in and on it. She thinks it makes a great drum. Good thing it is very sturdy.It easily collapses for storage.
positive,Love it!!: I love this book! I have made every item in the book. I love the new stitches I have learned from the book. If you are wanting to improve your crocheting this is the the book for you. I took my time and before I knew it I had made every project in the book . I have had so much fun going through this book. Great price and good book!
negative,"Trying too hard and not that funny.: This should have never made it to the theaters. I couldn't watch the entire thing, it was too stupid. They showed any funny parts it did have on the previews. I do like ""stupid"", ""silly"" comedy, but this one just wasn't funny. You may have to watch this one when you are tired and everything is funny, but I can think of much better movies to see."
negative,Can't believe how plain this is!: I am in shock at the blandness of this debut CD! I don't see the real Clay Aiken in the production at all. What a disappointment.
positive,"Manners can be fun: Very simple for small children to understand, stick people pictures keep the message simple to grasp."
positive,"Up-To-Date Dream Book For Monumental Mini Collectors.: Super 208 page volume jam packed with over 1,000 beautiful bronzetone sharp photos. Covers souvenir buildings, book ends, clocks, coin banks, thermometers, World's Fairs, sports, monuments and memorial. Features a great history of the collectible, how to build a collection, and makers and materials. Fully indexed for ease of use. Estimated values included. Very valuable reference for the mini building collector."
positive,"thought provoking: I read this book for the second time, this time with my bookclub and I have to up my rating, one whole star. Talking about this book in a group with women who have experienced the same feelings as Venus and Kandi was an enlightening experience. I can see where the author was going with the faulty ending. I can respect her choice for giving Clint to the other woman. Sometimes life happens that way and isn't truth stranger than fiction."
negative,"arrrgh: Avoid this book. It is one of the worst written fantasy books I have every read. I commented to a friend after reading it that he should avoid it as it reads like it was written by a teenage kid, only then did I find out that it actually was. This book did not deserve my hard earned money and I am annoyed at all the praise it received which seems more aimed at the authors age than the actually quality of the book. I didn't get a discount for his age so he should not be getting kind praise for this trash merely for his age."
negative,"An 18 Year Old Viewer...: Ugh, this movie is shocking. It was good concept to start with, but as we journeyed deeper into the film it began to become too cliche. Most of the actors were so busy passing horrible lines at each other and being played as typical romantic comedy stereotypes, I was only entertained by Marissa Tomei's open and funny preformance. In the end the movie is nothing special, so if you want to see a good recent Gibson movie watch Ransom, and if you want to see a good recent Helen Hunt movie... Uh... watch Project X!"
negative,"Descent Review: I ordered the DVD and it would not play the last two chapters, so I received another DVD and it still would not play the last two chapters. I only got part of my money back for something that was not my fault. I am not very happy with how the purchase turned out. I have not heard why both of the DVD's would not play the last two chapters also."
negative,Not the book from your childhood.: Stephen Gammell's amazing and terrifying art --the most memorable part of this series-- has been stripped and replaced with generic art by Brett Helquist in this edition.
positive,"Canada Green Lawn Seed is terrific!: Canada Green grass seed is the hardiest fast growing seed I have used to date. It grows in even the worst soils with minimal loose ground and some water. If it isn't watered immediately, all one needs to do is wait for rain. It will grow immediately thereafter!"
negative,"Changes the story: The main plot of this story is that a killer is trying to kill millions of kids by putting on his scary masks. But, it kind of ruins the Halloween series. What I mean is after you make a series, you never want to go off the subject. A Nightmare on Elm Street didn't, Friday the 13th didn't, and Hellraiser didn't."
negative,"Just Okay: A couple of songs were definitely made for Rod Stewart, but was disappointed in a couple of the songs. Even if you are a huge Rod Stewart fan, you may get disappointed."
positive,"Funky Songs: This CD rocks. Back to me, absolutely and If I Am are my favorites, but the whole CD is good. You cant compare them to any other band, but if you like this CD, you will definetely like Matchbox20, Vertical Horizon, Three Doors Down, Goo Goo Dolls, and all the other bands similar to this one. Buy this CD because it is NOT a waste of money and it is totally worth it...you may even wear out your copy! Buy it!!!"
positive,"It's my favorite book about 5 years: There are many funy things about money, wishes and so on. I smile every time when read their. When I have some problem in my life I get this book and read from any place I opened the book. And all the time I start to feel better."
negative,"Terrible: I couldn't even finish it. I kept reading it thinking, ""What is the point of this story?"" I found it very boring at times and disgusting at others. Definitely one of the worst books I've ever read."
negative,"A horrible translation: I have read a previous translation of The Stranger, and was deeply moved. My entire life was changed. The previous translator did Camus justice. Matthew Ward, with this translation of The Stranger, ruined the novel. Ward includes awful cliche and unintelligent description. Unfortunately this is the only translation currently in print in the US. If you are able to, please order from a forgein printer (sometimes printed under the title The Outsider) or consider searching for an out of print copy not translated by Matthew Ward."
negative,"QUEEN'S WEAKEST EFFORT: I really think the rest of the band don't think much of this album. There are only three good songs here: Under Pressure, Las Palabras De Amor and Back Chat. The other songs are forgettable."
negative,"Needs updated, needs index, needs better organization: As a Perl programmer I often need to look up a word or command to see how it is used. This reference makes it tough because it is organized by categories, instead of alphabetically. So if you're not sure what a command does - you'll look forever trying to find it. The book could also use a highlighted index along the side of the book like ""Perl in a Nutshell"" (This is the book you SHOULD get instead). They should expand the reference to include minor examples as well. Out of all the O'Reilly Perl books, this is the one I find myself going to the least - when it should be an indispensible reference..."
positive,Xantrex: I liked it a lot but seemed to have trouble charging it. It came in handy when my electricity went out.
negative,"Not 1080P: I got this for my Apple TV1080P. It works just fine on my older 720P Apple TV, but cuts in and out on the 1080....spend the extra couple bucks and get a better cable. Because I believed my cable to be capable of full 1080P, I brought my Apple TV back to the store.....I should have known better"
positive,"Great Movie: My only complaint is the length of time it took to arrive. Could not use a gift as planned. Somehow, shipping needs to be speedier!!!"
positive,DIRTY DANCING(LIMITED KEEPSAKE EDITION): I LOVED THE MOVIE THE DANCING AND SONGS ARE GREAT BESIDE LIKING THE TIME SETTING OF 1963. PATRICK AND JENNIFER MAKE IT WORK SO WELL. I LOVED THE OUTTAKES AND ALL THE BONUS FEATURES. THE BOOK IS GREAT WITH TERRIFIC PICTURES AND INFORMATION.I ALREADY HAD DVD OF MOVIE BUT THIS ONE HAS SO MUCH MORE INCLUDED . IT'S TO BAD PATRICK SWAYZE DIED HE WAS A VERY TALENTED DANCER/SINGER/ACTOR .
positive,"Just like dark chocolate or Asti Spumante!: Every now and again I like to have a couple of squares of really good dark chocolate or a split of Asti Spumante. Some women like to go shopping for a new scarf or a purse. I guess it is just one of those ""chick"" things. Sometimes, I like to curl up with a good romance.A good romance to me is one where I can become emotionally invested with the characters. It isn't about erotica but some sexual tension is always good.Taking Love in Strideis the perfect little treat I was looking for. I look forward to reading more from Donna Fasano. Now I just need to go out and get some chocolate and Asti."
positive,"A Commercial Trip: I bought this CD only for the song ""I am the Walrus"", which I heard on an ad for the BBC. It's bizarre, to say the least, but retreads the Sgt Pepper formula quite well - Wild trippy tracks, ""I am the Walrus"" , ""strawberry fields"", with more mellow Mccartney tunes ""the fool on the hill"" and ""Your mother should know"", and Harrison's usual Indian influeneced madness ""Blue jay Way"". All in all, it's great fun, and ""Hello Goodbye"" is possibly one of the greatest songs ever to come out of '67."
positive,"This show keeps finding new routes.: I do not LOVE this show*, but I find it very entertaining and each season gets more exciting. I enjoy seeing how the plot thickens and moves along season to season. Season 4 takes the show to a whole new place and I have really enjoyed it.*I love some of the actors and am annoyed by others. I think the writing is generally good and I love the plot development."
negative,"I Was SOOOOOOOOOOOO Disappointed!!: I love Clay Aiken to death, but I was really disappointed with this CD... I really feel that it is too commercial. I love his voice and he ""curled my toes"" when I saw American Idol. He and Ruben were my picks. I was sad when Clay didn't win, and I liked the ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" CD single, but I didn't like this. I won't pre-order any more... I'll wait to hear clips."
negative,"JH: The basic device is pretty good, sound quality, simple controls, good display. But, the rest of the package is shoddy. The software is very confusing. The owners manual is simplistic and just plain wrong in a number of areas, particularly when describing the software. It comes with a nice looking leather pouch, that is unfortunately too small to hold the player without constantly squeezing the buttons. The pouch is also not designed to accomodate the earphone jack, so you have to walk around with the pouch flap hanging open all the time. I contacted Samsung technical support and their tech reps agreed with me regarding the software problems but couldn't help other than to suggest I try a different company's software! Bottom line, a real turn off from Samsung."
negative,"Static: Could be a characteristic of all amplified phones, but this one had static everytime the boost is used. Returned it."
positive,"Awesome selection of scents and great quality balms!: The balm melts a bit when applied, coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but isn't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents aren't as strong as others but they're pretty true to their name :) Dessert/creamy ones tend to be ""weaker"" and citrus/tangy ones are stronger. My favorites (I'm a fruity/tangy lover) are midori and gummy bear."
negative,"What a disappointment...: Last Days was easily the worst movie I have seen since Eight Heads in a Duffle Bag. From start to finish, it was disjointed and each scene was entirely too long. In fact, I watched the last 30 minutes of the move in 10x speed and didn't miss a thing!Van Sant did not establish any kind of connection with the characters. You don't really even know Blake is a troubled musician (as it says in the synopsis) until half way through the movie, so you spend time watching him mope around the house in, what appears to be, a drug-induced stupor. But you really don't know what's wrong with him and it's not very interesting to watch.I had high hopes for this movie, especially after watching the making of it in the Special Features section, but it was a complete waste of time."
negative,"Fansubbed bootlegs - don't buy.: These episodes have not been released in the U.S. yet, and probably won't be for years. These are fansubbed bootlegs, low quality, and unauthorized. Buying this supports only the pirates who put it out, and won't do a thing to reward the artists who originally created the work. Don't buy it."
positive,"I love It!: it does what it is supposed to do making you look slimmer in the waist area. my grandmother even notice it, and she didn't even know i bought it. It really makes you look smaller in that area of your body. I would most likely buy another one but next time in a small not medium."
negative,"A review of the actual quality of this edition: All opinions aside about the plot or quality of writing of this story, the build quality of this book itself is horrible. The copy I have has strange spacing on many pages, offset sometimes, different sized fonts on other pages. I recommend buying another paperback, not this one."
positive,"Real winner!: Love this item - it cooks very well and never sticks, which allows quick clean-up. The food tastes very good and is soft and well done - just the way I like it. This is a very convenient and easy to use pot."
positive,"Midway: This movie is one of my favourite, I've watched it many times as I have bought a copy. The only set back I feel about this movie is that it has used some of the footage from Tora Tora Tora. which I feel has damaged the action part of the film. Midway is a small island. It does not have a big airport like Honolulu. Why do they have to add in the scene of a big airport being bombed and a fighter crashed into other fighters in a big field. Besides, the landing of a B-17 with only one wheel is definitely not necessary. Anyone who like war movies will surely recognised the scene is from Tora Tora Tora."
positive,"Great way to stay healthy when your diet's not the best!: I am a grad student with little income and not big on cooking. I do work out regularly but my diet is not the best (I definitely don't get the right amount of fruits and vegetables every day from what I eat). I started taking this product a few months ago (in combination with a protein/vitamin B complex orange flavored syrup and fruit juices -non citrus, plus 3oz of Aloe vera gel)... I've been feeling great, rarely get a cold (if I do it lasts shorter, and my heartburn is gone, that is thanks to the nasty-tasting Aloe I get separately). I do feel you have to take it everyday to feel the benefits (once a day is enough for me). This is definitely NOT a meal replacement for those trying to loose weight. I have tasted other green powder products and this is undoubtedly the best according to my taste buds. (Flavor tip: Adding Juicy Juice Apple/Banana 100% flavored juice complements the powder best.)"
positive,voices from the farm: i have a copy of this book and love it and can't wait til the revised version comes out in a few weeks
negative,"First hard drive to ever crash on me: I've had many computers and many drives, but this is the first hard drive I've had that just inexplicably crashed on me. I turned on my computer, it started making loud grinding noises, and goodbye data. After reading other reviews, it's obvious that I'm not the only one to experience this from an IBM drive. I'll never buy an IBM hard drive again."
positive,good but not great: There is not perfect harmony throughout the cd. can be shocking during chill time.
negative,"Who wrote this: An anthropologist or a travel guide?: Pointless conversation, facts laid out in laundry list form, inconsistent characterization, interminable passages of description...this is the most self-indulgent book I've read in a while. Maybe that's a pitfall of success.I couldn't finish it and I didn't care what happened. If Jean Auel's fans (and I am one) aren't disappointed, they darn well should be."
positive,very good: this product is awesome. it hide all your secrets. I would recommend this product to all women and men. I will buy product again.
positive,"not the usual junk: Tired of your newsweekly's glitzy ""media"" column? Or establishment outlets like CNN Reliable Sources? This book is some non-corporate, free thinking... substance! (at last) Written from a genuinely philosophical bent, informed by history and the social sciences, this is not the kind of analysis you find in the MSM.But the beauty part is it's all that AND a breeze to read. And covers not just the usual political-media topics, but how media pervades how we live our lives in all the day-to-day banality.So, great beach reading AND you'll impress your summer dinner guests afterwards with your insights from this book..."
positive,"Love this movie....: Short & sweet, awesome movie, even better soundtrack. The acting is immpecable. Robert De Niro as always, is great, I love to see him in a role where he's not the wise guy. Chaz Palmenteri is so handsome in this movie. Again the music for me, makes the movie."
negative,"Disorganized, semi-coherent, useful insights carefully obscured: Mann offers some fresh insights, some or all may be valid; however, the wandering style and lack of scholarly approach makes the book next to useless for one wanting to understand pre-Columbus America."
positive,"Very interesting.... like nothing i have seen before: In my German class, one boy brought this movie in. I really didn't know what to expect, because most movies we see in German class are a bit old.. this one is very different, and creative. I have never seen anything so different, and imaginative. It is very well done, and interesting. Nothing that anyone should miss seeing."
negative,"James Joyce Said It Best !: ""I've put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality.""James Joyce"
positive,"Compelling and haunting: This should have been a classic. I saw it originally in the 70s and decided recently to rent it...I wanted to know if it had the same appeal.....if anything, it was far more beautiful than memory served. the scenery is spectacular, the acting suberb! They don't make movies like this anymore! Pour yourself a nice glass of wine and settle down to a very entertaining movie."
positive,FUNNY - TRUELIFE - KINDLY WRITTEN - SOMETIMES ANNOYING: This book has left me wanting more. Not many books do this for me. I felt the relationshop between the sisters was very cleverly written. Who could fail to like Darcy? ? A very real person. Also Sophia - at the beginning I disliked her - then I continually liked and disliked her - I still can't make up my mind. I have given four stars because I was frustrated that we did not discover more about Alex and Darcy. I hope a second book with these characters is written.
positive,Pretty happy :): The book came actually a lot quicker than i was expecting and it made me very happy. the book was in good condition and there are no problems at all :) very satisfied thank you :D
negative,"bad fit, way too big: Only buy these if you have huge ears! Even the smallest ones were too big for my ears.Jabra EarGels - ClearI suppose in theory they should work to channel the sound into your ear, but that's only if the pieces fits into your ear, I didn't get a chance to test that aspect."
negative,"read some of the book before buying: I thought the premise for this book was very good, and I bought it with the intent to read it and share it with friends. However, I returned the book for a refund after reading less than half of the story.The main character in the story was constantly swearing or crying. The cleanliness of the kitchen was questionable, which was making me lose my appetite for the French food being prepared. The only eggs I want to read about in a book about cooking are the kind that come from hens. I really did not want to know that the main character was able to pay off her credit cards by selling her own eggs - twice! Parts of the story describe the main character's job near Ground Zero as an impatient and unsympathetic secretary at an agency that assisted families of the victims of 9/11.My advice to readers is to read a good portion of this book in a bookstore before you decide to purchase it, especially if you intend to give this book as a gift."
positive,"Other Translations?: I have to believe there is a better translation out there. I've only seen one other though, so I suppose I can merely HOPE there is another. The Maguire-Malmstad version seems hopelessly clunky on the sentence level. I can imagine Bely's novel reads like this in Russian as well, but again, I HOPE it does not!I can't say this story has quite as much ""human"" interest as Ulysses, a book that can easily be appreciated apart from its experimental nature. Bely's book is more obscure in those terms. Sort of a cross, perhaps, between Ulysses and Musil's Man Without Qualities (probably a lot more like the latter in the way the characters are presented). Certainly only for people who like ""experimental"" writing."
negative,"The producer should have his[butt]sued: Come on, lesbians in a video. Really. Little kids too. They were 12 when they shot it. It's one thing to use sexuality in your music to express yourself. But having them making out in the rain is utterly disgusting.But, on the MUSIC. They need to learn English. Again. They should come back when they've matured their creativity, image, and style. They sound pretty good in their russian tracks, but man, do they have to be the ultimate high-production-no substance-group to sell? Yes and NoYes, cause they haven't developed as musicians, and need to find a better company to deal with.No, cause they have potential, but must find it themselves. They shouldn't have to make out in a rain-storm to get publicity. The album leaves a bad taste in the listeners mouth, and they need to wipe it away. After they become true musicians, that is.I don't blame the duo. They aren't true musicians, and shouldn't be judged as musicians.But for Heaven's sake, what a [strange] producer!"
negative,"Good information, if you can find it.: A reference book is only as good as its index, and this one was terrible! The book contains valuable information for the new breastfeeding mother. However, the index was the worst I have ever used. There would be 10-20 pages sited for a word or topic, most of which only mentioned the word in passing, or not at all. Unless you plan on reading this book cover to cover (and think you will be able to remember everything you have read) find a different book."
negative,"Overrated: For reference, I have been following Lauryn since I first peeped ""Vocab"" back on the Fugees' first album.As for now, it's years later, and she drops two deadweights and goes out on her own. I find the album is immediately likable, but only two of her songs can withstand repeated listenings. As a hip-hop junkie, I still like the first track, filled with clever (albeit a bit soft) battle rhymes. And as a hip-hop junkie, that's all I like. The rest is a bad mix of hip-hop and R&B, which seem to be mixed just for the sake of mixing hip-hop and R&B. The results are songs like Ex-Factor, an otherwise perfectly lovely song if it were not for the ultra annoying ""yo yo yo yo yo"" background Lauryn insists on putting in.Oh well. I was looking forward for Lauryn to blaze the trail for the new generation of female hip-hoppers. Now instead of creating an exquisite hip-hop album, she made a sophmoric R&B album that is embraced by pop fans one month and totally forgotten the next."
negative,"Pixelated and Dull: Poster is quite pixelated and the colors are much more dull than on the real piece itself, it does not do justice to this beautiful work of art. Having seen the original many times at it's home at the Prado museum in Madrid, I am very dissapointed with this poor reproduction. This is one of the most fantastic paintings, if not the most, by Bosche and I highly recommend searching elsewhere for a quality reproduction - even if you have to shell out some extra money it's worth it since this is a famously intricate painting where detail matters immensely."
positive,"Fast shipping, great condition: Very happy with this product as it was shipped timely and in excellent condition, as described by seller."
negative,"Great Writing Set to Tepid Music: I stock Neil Young records in the ""Must Have"" category. When I need the right words or the right crank, I put Neil on. That's not to say he puts both of these elements in the same song. He's got enough material to fertilize a cow pasture. Unfortunately musically, that's where most of this album belongs. Also unfortunately this record is being grouped in the Folk Rock genre along with Harvest, Harvest Moon and Comes a Time. This is realy Silver & Gold PtII. There's no semblance of country rock here that other publications are calling it. It just isn't. Tepid Folk music is more like it. The tempos drag as Neil tells his stories. And that's very unfortunate because the writing is superb. Whether it's due to him viewing his own mortality with his brush with death or the passing of his father last year, it doesn't matter. The word smithing is strong. It's too bad the vehicle the words ride on is only firing on a couple of cylinders"
negative,"What's happening to DVD's of the 70's????: I was really shocked and disappointed to find this DVD had been cut... this was one of the best films I saw in the 70's. I also discovered that another great movie, ""Goodbye Columbus,"" has been edited down to a PG since its release on DVD with the original nude scenes deleted. I'm encouraging people NOT to buy or rent these DVD's and to write the studios and complain... it's bad enough that Columbia and Paramount have ruined their own product, but they didn't even have the courtesy to notify buyers that they weren't purchasing the original films. I agree with another reviewer here... we're being robbed."
negative,USB cable did not work for me: Tried connecting the cable with my printer and laptop for firmware update. neother Laptop nor printer identified the USB cable. I tried other cables like my camera USB cable with printer and laptop which it was able to identify. I am returning it.
negative,"Garbage written by a teenager is still garbage: If this book had not had a gimmick of coming from a kid, it would have been thrown on the scrap heap at any publisher and recycled. Which it should have been. This is a really terrible piece of fan fiction, and the fact that it has gotten the attention it has is a complete sin. When I first heard that a teenager had written it, I wondered if he might have had help from his parents. Now that I've seen it, I can only hope he didn't, because that means there are even more bad writers in the world than just him."
positive,"Love it and NOT paid to write this!: I don't know what made reviewer Jesse think the reviews of this product were written by people paid by the company to give positive reviews. I am a real person, have used this product for over a year and like it very much. I am at an age where I look for ""Age Perfect"" products, or more often ""Age Fighting"". This eye cream is light, not greasy and makes the area around my eyes feel moisturized more than just using a day moisturizer alone. It seems to me my crows feet are less noticiable also. I am blonde and have fairly sensitive skin and have had no problems with any type of skin reaction. What Jesse needs to realize is that anyone could have a reaction to an ingredient in any product that they are allergic to, that doesn't mean it isn't a good product for someone else without the allergy. I have used LOREAL products for years and have always liked them. Click my name on this review to see all the other reviews I have written, and NO, they aren't all good!"
positive,"A lot of bang for the buck: Over the years, I've owned dozens of binoculars, pricewise these are in the middle, but for performance they are much closer to the top. I don't recall exactly what I paid, I think a little over $200 I have owned and still do own several different 10x42 roof prism models including Nikon Monarch, Sightron, Pentax, Swift, Bushnell Legands, and others, none that grab more often than these. I just like them."
positive,"The Hobbit: I am a 10 year old boy who read the hobbit. The book begins in the Shire were Billbo, Hobbit, lives. Gandalf, wisered,arives in Bilbo's house he tells Bilbo to join the dwarfs on an adventure to reclaim their gold. I liked this book because the people they meet on the way to get the treasure of Under the Mountain. But the treasure is guarded by a huge dragon. By the time they get to the palace which is torn down, they are getting tracked by goblins. Will they get the treasure? Will threy survive?"
negative,"Sent wrong item: I've seen this movie, it's great, however the item I thought I purchased was NOT the item I received. I am still waiting for a refund or an exchange. (the movie I received is formatted for European DVD players, not USA)"
negative,"EMPTY BOX: I opened up the crest strips to ""NO AVAIL"" it was completly empty with the instructions I am asking for a refund I will let you know what happens.. It can be an honest mistake lets see when they refund me"
positive,"Definitely the best since the first: A wonderfully done film with great performances by Heather Langenkamp and Miko Hughes. Miko Hughes performance sent chills down my spine. I can not believe this the same young actor who had an reoccuring role on Full House, one of the worst TV series ever. He is up there with Haley Joel Osment and Elijah Wood for great young actors. Heather Langenkamp pulls of the role to a ""T"". Her nightmares and the confusion they are causing between the lines of reality and dreams is something she has obviously done before, but she is more believeable now. The most chilling scene is when Miko Hughes, who plays Dylan, attacks his Mother, Heather Langenkamp, with his own version of Freddy's glove. In my opinion if a kid can pull off doing such a role, they cause more chills than adults, because in these kind of films you expect it to be an adult. Truly, a well crafted film, one of Craven's best. GRADE: A-"
negative,"If you liked the book, you will not like this film.: Unfortunately, the screenwriter completely changed the story of Under the Tuscan Sun. True, the main character did buy a villa in Tuscany. However, this story primarily concerns Diane Lane's trauma of divorce and trying to find herself in Italy. The film has very little about the trials of her renovation of the villa. Most importantly, the film says nothing about the book's description of life in a small Tuscan village and the people who live there. I was very disappointed in the film."
negative,"Out dated: I purchased this book because a student is using it in his parochial school. The young teacher seems to be trying to teach with the instruments and style with which he was taught. I see much better recently updated textbooks. This reminded me of why students have questioned ""why do I have to learn this stuff anyway."" There is too much early emphasis on linguistic models and computationally trickery which actually suits later concepts. Other books I use have a more modern focus on functions and applications."
positive,"Good novel, but the other books in the series are better.: Foundation is a good book, but is only a must read because the 2 books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are must-reads. It's a shame that few lists of his books include Foundation and Earth, but if you like science fiction, that is the best novel ever."
negative,Rice spoils in 1 day: Have had for over 1 year - rice kept great at first for up to 3/4 days!!! But not sure what happened and the rice starts to Spoil if left overnight. Had it for about 2.5 years now and really upset about how many batches of rice I've had to throw out. I tried cleaning it with bleach consistently to kill bacteria and that helps through one or two cycles but the same Problem comes up again and again. Doesn't last for 15 years like old cooker my mom had that was probably a fraction of cost.
negative,"Stupid, Dumb Advice by Dumb, Stupid Author: This book gave no straight advice, was dumb, boring, and repetitive many times. I finished it in less than a day and then used the pages for toilet tissue when I was done."
positive,"About what I expected: It was about everything I expected because I read the reviews first. I wanted something that would be very inexpensive, but would serve the purpose. So far I have no complaints I have had several fires in my fireplace and it has served the purpose for which it was intended quite well.Each piece is a good weight in your hand, the stand is a little unstable but I just set it close to the hearth wall and its ok.Overall I am very happy especially for the price I paid for it."
positive,"Good Buy: This printer has not caused my any troubles to this date. It's a quality little printer, as all HP products tend to be. The quality is good, but not great. This is an ideal printer for the casual user at home or office. The connection is USB, so the setup was easy. This printer also works well on my home network. If you need a good quality printer at a good price, the deskjet 825c would be an excellent choice."
negative,"You've Got to be Kidding: For all those who compare Ruben and Clay, there is no comparison. Ruben won b/c he is a true talent. While Clay had to be ""made over"", Ruben is still Ruben. I listened to Clay's first 5 songs and had to turn it off. While he can sing other peoples songs well he cannot hold a tune to his own album. I was extremely disappointed, and would not buy this CD."
negative,"Soap operatic saga full of caricatures: I just finished this book, and I am hugely disappointed. The book could have been condensed down to a third of it's current form. There are ramblings that go on for pages that repeat information that just felt like page fillers. It seems like no editing had been done for this book. Clavell tortures us with poor writing, shallow characters, and caricaturization of all Chinese characters and especially completely distorted view and depiction of all women in the book. Perhaps Mr. Clavell suffered from seeing all women as virgins or whores. A total waste of time."
positive,A Great Story: I can't believe with all the books I've read that I never read this one. It was wonderful. enjoyed every page right to the end.
positive,"Hi-Tec, the best !: Hi-Tecs are the BEST, the coloring has come out of these, now kinda of a weird green color (?), but they have a good tight fit, did a week in them @ Isle Royale last summer ! No complaints."
negative,"chrome license plate frame: I have already thrown this product away. After one winter in Iowa, it is all rusty. I did try to use soft steel wool to bring it back. This worked well but only for a short time.I would recommend a more durable product if you are in cold climates."
negative,"Wish I Could Have Tried It: I would like to give this item a fair review but I never received it. I have a new four month old that recently grew out of his swaddle blankets. He needed a new swaddler but this item never came. It said it was shipped out??? Anyhow, I bought a similar one at Babies r Us and it was on sale too. If anyone knows how to dispute this purchase with amazon, please, let me know."
negative,"Simplistic in the extreme: For a book on the lyrics of a band as complex and intellectual as Rush's, this book is a joke. Even with the most simple examination of these songs, I can not figure out how this author could have come up with this analysis. I am a die-hard Rush fan and I still could hardly get through it."
positive,"Great bargain: 10 of the most used items in basic household cooking. THis is the ultimate starter set. I'm a bachelor, and with this set, I can do anything from 4 pancakes at a time in the 12"" saute (I'll probably get the cdouble burner griddle eventually), to a single omelette in the the 8"" skillet. The 2 and 3 qt sauciers are exactly what I need for pasta, potatoes, veggies. They have a nice heft to them, and the non-stick coating has worked flawlssly. Keep in mind, eggs always seem to stick, even on the best non-stick, so use a little oil or butter with them. Highly recommended. Get a steamer insert, and the 6 qt piece is perfect."
positive,"Where Is The DVD?: How can such a beautifully filmed movie directed by David Lean not yet be available on DVD? The superior quality of DVD over video tape would lift this film to the level of how it played on the big screen when first released. The storms, the Irish coast and just about every other scene filmed would look so much better on DVD. John Mills gave his finest performance in this movie and won a deserved Oscar.It would be a fitting epitaph to his memory if the film distributors reissued Ryans Daughter in DVD. Nearly all of David Leans other films are available in DVD format. Why not this epic film?"
positive,"Disappointing Video Quality: Please describe the audion and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was disappointing. Some scenes were very good, while others were grainy. It varied from 5.0 to 8.5 on a 10 point scale, and I have never rated a Blu-Ray at less than 4.0.The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was adequate for the movie. I didn't notice much surround sound, and no sub-woofer bass.The movie itself was pretty good."
negative,"repetitive, lackluster: I wanted to read this before seeing the film. Wow, what a bore. Keel's book reads like some scatter-shot diary with himself as the narrator. Maybe this stuff was revelatory back when it was originally published, but now with the X-Files cultural phenomena and all the other media about UFOs and the paranormal floating around, this seems pedestrian in comparison. The descriptions are always the same. Only the names change each chapter/sighting/contacting.Also, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK before seeing the movie. It will sap some of your enjoyment from Mark Pellington's excellent film (in fact, I was amazed at how well screenwriter Richard Hatem took this dross and put a narrative structure around it, but that's another review that belongs elsewhere....)"
positive,"A great book, I loved it .: It is a great book ,it was very edventurous and existing. And had great detail .it was wild and mithicle"
negative,Very Thin and leaks: Tried pampers for the first time and it was size 5. It's very Thin and most of the time it leaks from the side when she poops.
positive,"Sixteen of Peter Gabriels's Seventeen Golden Greats: For those of us who remember Peter Gabriel's solo career all the way back to ""Solsbury Hill,"" this album is an excellent compilation of his work with one glaring exception: ""In Your Eyes"" is not here, and for those of us who consider this his best song our consolation is that we already own ""So"" (or the score from ""Say Anything""). One of the things I most appreciate about this collection is that the songs are not simply arranged chronologically; there is an attempt to mix and match the songs to form a cohesive album. Certainly you do not want to hear another song after the haunting last track ""Biko."""
positive,"Far better than its reputation, and well worth a look: Intelligent, funny, sad, real, with a terrific dramatic performance by Adam Sandler.For a lot of it's length I thought it would be a truly great film, but some clunky, almostsit-com plot turns in the last 1/4, a little too much length, and not-quite-there supportingperformances in key roles hold it back and keep it a very good movie, not a great one.None-the-less, far better than the often cold response in got in most of the mainstream press."
negative,"Love Clay's voice & talent but NOT this CD.: All the cuts are so similar and so boring. There is very little passion, emotion, or personality in this CD. Honestly, next time I am out of town in a hotel, I'm leaving it for the maid.I loved Clay on American Idol. I wish he'd done the CD with ""Solitaire"", ""Buttercup"" and others from the show."
negative,"Sedaka's ""Greatest Hits"" a bust: With the exception of 3 songs, this ""greatest hits"" is a misnomer. The majority of his songs I can't believe were ever actual hits. Basically an unlistenable record."
negative,"THE WORST!: SO bad it is nearly forgotten. Hollywood turned it into a Michael Douglas movie at the peak of his career and completely and totaly ruined the show. It is just plain awful, nothing remotely close to what it ought to have been, or even close to the stage show. STAY AWAY!!!"
negative,"Quite OK!: An average movie, the effects are a bit dated, but it is QUITE OK! The quality of this DVD is very good."
positive,"Excellent Bible CDrom!: I don not understand the negative reviews on this product. As a multimedia Bible, Compton's (now Zondervan) is probably the best moderate priced computer Bible on the market. Superlative and intuitive multimedia presentation combined with the very readable and accurate NIV Bible text plus commentary gives the average reader and excellent online Bible (sure is more fun than the standard book form)! From papyrus to codex to computer, the Bible can never die as the Word of God. Compton's Interactive NIV is proof of it - enjoy this Bible for the tech age!"
negative,"Disappointing: A vividly imagined tale of what might have been had the infamous Lucky Lucan (wanted for murder) come to Paris with his body double, settled in for overpriced psychotherapy with a former fake stigmatic and ultimately ended up sealing his fate in a most unexpected (and unbelievable) way. Although clever in places, witty in spots, I found this book a quick read primarily because I wanted to be finished with it quickly. The characters were brittle and unsympathetic. The scenes artificial. The book flowed like a swift stream, confident even cocky in places, but lacking the kind of depth that makes you want to dive in and swim."
positive,"Great historical review: Excellent book. It was enjoyable and takes you back to Colonial times. Once you get used to the older English, it is an easy read"
positive,Timeless and just Awesome!: I love Felt! great band and I have all of their recordings. This one is probably my favorite in their whole catalogue. Dreamy Psychedelic and heartbreakingly beautiful in places. I will never get tired of this recording. Maurice Deebank is an incredible underrated guitarist and Lawrence is perfect at what he does. A truly great recording that the average listener will never understand. Genius!
negative,"what happend?: what happend to the old pearl jam? this cd is pretty boring. there's no juming around on the cd. tracks 5 and 6 or good even without the wildness, but they lost it,"
positive,"another great!: I love this Hitchcock film - his stuff is great, some of my favourite classic films from the early to mid 20th cent. You can't go wrong with this one - an innocent girl lead along by a cheeky but dashing suspect - how can you not love him!!"
negative,"Rotten egg: If there is a rotten egg rating, this one is it. A self-absorbed writer who cannot cook decent meals blabbering on how marriage-worthy she is than Julia Child, thinking this is a good joke; well, if you think you have a sick sense of humor, read on. I had to let it ricochet to the trash bin by the first third of the book. This book does belong to the trash."
positive,"a great way to get to know woody: I enjoyed reading this book. Woody writes with a unique perspective and style. This book along with his fictional/ autobiographical-Seeds of Man are must reads to get to know this uniquely american hero (but Joe Kleins biography-Woody Guthrie, a life is the best way to really get to know Woody.)"
negative,"Hollywood doo doo: Just another overblown, overspecial effected, hollywood mess with very little thought to good plot or dialogue. And that actress is not attractive enough for a movie with this budget. And Will Smith needs to spend less time in the weight room and more time in an acting class. And all this old fashioned Sci-Fi just doesn't make good movies today. (see war of worlds)"
negative,"Bad Songs Say So Much: What a lousy soundtrack for a suprisingly fun movie. Some of the actual score pieces are decent, but NONE of Elton's songs on this album are worth even a brief listen. Save your money and buy ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" or ""Madman Across the Water."""
positive,"Classic Vintage Michael J. Fox: There are certain movies that encapsulate so perfectly an actor's appeal. Doc Hollywood is that movie and Michael J. Fox is that actor. Before illness defined Fox, he was known as being quick and charming, quirky and brainy. Doc Hollywood showcases all that I love about the actor.This is also very much an ensemble movie. The town's inhabitants are ridiculously charming. David Ogden Stiers shines brightly as the mayor of a small town. You have Woody Harrelson in a hilarious role as an insurance agent and Bridget Fonda doing southern like no one should ever do again. Julie Warner, as the love interest, isn't as fetching as you want her to be - but what can you do?I've seen it again and again and still love it so."
positive,"I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS ONE, AND OH, IT IS JUST KILLING ME IT IS SO GOOD!!!: I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT, THEN AGAIN, WHO WOULDN'T, IT IS SPIDER-MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS MY FAVIROTE HIGH FLYING, GREAT WEBSLINGING ADVENTURE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! AND, IF I COULD, I WOULD GIVE IT AS MANY STARS AS THERE ARE IN THE UNIVERSE! I HAVE BEEN ENTICED RIGHT OUT OF MY SEAT AND INTO THE WORLD OF MARVEL, I EVEN FIND MYSELF WISHING FICTION WERE REAL- SUPER-HEROES, AND VILLAINS, BUT WHICH ONE WOULD I BE, ONLY I KNOW."
positive,"Does what it says.: I bought the Apricorn EZ-UP-Universal Kit and used it to clone the 80 GB hard drive in my HP laptop with a 320 GB hard drive. It was easy, intuitive, worked flawlessly and I am very impressed. I did not have to reinstall Windows XP or anything. It just made a perfect clone of my hard drive and I swapped them and the laptop booted just like before but with 240 additional GB available. Wow! Now I have another 320 GB hard drive in the blue box that comes in the kit and use it as an external hard drive. You can do that with the kit as an added bonus. Great software, great hardware. I recommend it to anyone who wants an easy way to upgrade a hard drive."
negative,"Foot Splash: It is not antifungal. For a new, fresh, clean scentto feet, eh maybe try massage oil or a scented moisturizing powderrather than this product."
positive,"Riveting: The writing is beautiful, the story is nearly too bizarre to be true (and therefore engaging as hell). It sucked me in and spit me out a different person. This one is going to stick with me for a long time."
negative,"Not recommended!: When I received this, not only was it way too small for me, the first and only thing I noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging! It was unbearable, sort of like a burnt rubber smell. There's no way I would recommend this to anyone. There are definitely other products on the market that do the job!!"
positive,"great buy: Awesome book, I bought it for a friend who is really stressed about writing college essays right now, she loves it! For the price, you really can't go wrong either"
negative,"The Story Of Mankind: The first 100 pages of this book are entertaining. He writes in a way that keeps you interested up to a point. I am an avid reader and this book took me many months to finish. I didn't even want to finish it but always feel compelled to do so. History repeats itself and after so many chapters of war I just didn't care anymore. After reading this book I felt that desiring peace in a time of war is hardly possible. Looking back over our history made this clear-humans, power, and violence go hand in hand."
positive,Ah...the Real Michael Crichton: I loved this book. It was great to read about the private side of this amazing author. His spiritual insights give us a wonderful background to appreciate his works of fiction. All Crichton fans will enjoy this book!
positive,"Really very amazing: This film was extremely captivating, great acting, great score by Hans Zimmer, the movie was really amazing, i just brougt the DVD yesterday, i haven't seen all the special features yet, but the trailers and TV spots are great. also it was great to see how the movie was made, this movie it's really captivating, i recommend you to watch it with the DTS ES audio track, it's reallt much better than the Dolby Digital., this is definetly one of the best films of the year 2000."
negative,"VR: Well first of all I dont think anybody should judge Roger, If they did their research they would know what happened, Once Dead was ok a few good tunes but overall it all sounds the same. For the Human Sacrficie Album Mulligan's Stew is probobly my Favorite VR Tune."
positive,"Shocking Injustice: I should be surprised, but am not, by two so-called reviews of the book. What they present are not reviews but personal opinions. This is largely what the book lays out as a reason for the conviction of Betty Wilson. This woman was not convicted on any evidence or fact but on the testimony of a proven liar, schizophrenic, alcoholic, drug-addicted man that turned on his own men in Vietnam. Whether people agree or disagree with the verdict, people are supposed to be convicted on fact and not opinion. This book is eye opening and needs to be read by those possessing skills of discernment and reason. One can only hope that justice will prevail in the end although it appears that will not happen in this case."
positive,"Where to buy this cheap: I have only read part of this book so far (and loved it), but the reason I am writing this, is to let people know that it is $2.99 at The Christmas Tree Store. I bought 4, so if my family is reading this, you'll have a good idea of what you are getting next year."
negative,"Oh! So BORING: I don't understand how readers actually like this depressing, dark, dismal book. I just couldn't finish it. I got to page 90 and couldn't go back to it. The first book ever, that I couldn't finish. I didn't want to finish it!!!! It bored me to tears. I felt nothing for the characters. I felt nothing for the plot. It's a waste of money and reading time. I just feel for all those HS kids who are required to read it for English class. Avoid it if you can!!!! And try to reason with your English teacher...."
negative,Rescuers: DVD did not work. Still trying to figure out how to get my money back. If you can help let me know. Thanks
negative,"Ridiculous: Their behavoir makes no sense. Their reaction to what is happening is cartoonish, it might of worked as a comedy."
negative,"what use is astrology?: Too technical, too work shop based, for the professionals only, not the book I was hoping for."
positive,Wonderful: This is a wonderful Christian-directed set of lesson plans for pre-K and Kindy age children. They are very well thought out and a wonderful tool for teaching young children! A must-have!
positive,"**THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE DVD**: Well, its better than the other version.There could have been more on this DVD, but bonsidering it was lightly promoted and was Martin Scorsese's early film, there is not too much extra. The extras include ALL:*All New Digital Tranfer*Commentary by Martin Scorsese*Martin Scorsese Featurette ""Back on the Block""*Theatrical TrailerLike I said, at least its better than the other version."
negative,Good Book Horrid structure: I don't know if it just the electronic version or if the printed version was the same way. It's a good book but the paragraph and chapter structure are almost nonexistent. One paragraph seemed to run over the course of several days starting with two characters having a conversation and going several more characters were the original two were no longer present and eventually ending with one of the original characters (I may be exaggerating but not by much).
positive,"Bringing the Big Picture into View: This book is a very informative, yet easy read about the realities of life and how patterns are repeated sometimes even unknowingly until honestly addressed and changed. That is where the power of this book lies in giving insight, tools, all with a touch of humor to make positive changes of direction in our lives. Highly recommend."
negative,give us a break: how can they expect us to buy this dvd again. When everyone buys this version they will come out with spiderman 2.5 with special commentary by aunt may. Give us a freakin break.
negative,"This is a classic?: I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful."
negative,Cover misleading: The cover indicated unusual scenes on the golf course. The other monthly pictures were rather ordinary.
positive,"Could be said to be ""the final word"" on the subject: The only reason this book got 4 starts instead of 5 is the slight anti-American tone at times (for example, the US inquiries are treated as a almost a joke) and something in this much detail could not help but be tedious at points (the discussion of ""port"" and ""starboard"" lights comes to mind),but it is extremely well-done, leaves no point untouched, examines minutely any evidence in Lord's favor, and comes to the point of the matter- he saw what he knew ""might have been"" distress rockets and did nothing- and really, that is the end of it."
positive,"Laugh Out Loud: Her books are always intricately plotted and funny, but this one had some sibling rivalry that struck a chord with me. I felt the characters were all well developed and supported. I am a huge fan of Crusie's books and I might be biased, but this is one book I've read more than once for the reasons I've listed. You can't go wrong with any of her books."
negative,"*Barf*: How can anyone call this a book? I hate this book! I wish there was a -5, because this book is boring, pointless, and ill-concieved. I will not so much as look at Paolini's next book."
negative,why i think the book is going to be great: I think this book is really good for people who continuously tried to be one of the people out on the court.This is the perfect book to start with.
negative,"what a joke: this movie is so stupid. waste of anybody's money or time. Not even Catherine Zeta Jones can make it seem worth watching. no parts in the movie were scary at all. In fact, was this a comedy by mistake?"
positive,"two thumbs way up!!!!!!!: De Niro can't get any more better as an actor or a director! The story is a classic, and the actors are the best. You must experience Robert De Niro as an actor, it makes me ask why he hasn't done it more than once! Just buy this dvd!"
negative,"Very dissatisfied: I was extremely unhappy with this book, a few of the recipes were alright. However, many of the recipes were very dry and hard to form into cookies due to not enough liquid. Another problem was the ability to layer all the ingredients into the mason jar!!!! THEY WOULDN'T FIT therefore having ruined a whole recipe of ingredients."
negative,"Stage Fright Is Not Genetic: Coyote Ugly is a movie about a young woman who moves from her father's home in New Jersey to New York City to become a singer/songwriter. To make ends meet, she finds employment at a bar and dates an Australian orphan. In the end, she succeeds and produces her own album. She stops working at the first bar because she's financially secure."
negative,"A good subject badly done: I fondly remember reading a fascinating biography of George Washington Carver when I was much younger...this wasn't it.This book reads like a series of short anecdotes about Dr. Carver, with very little connecting them. It can be confusing with it's bad cohesion and tendancy to wander off track.I knew I was in trouble on page one when I couldn't figure out what year it was talking about. Paragraph one talks about the great news of the the 13th amendment ending slavery in 1865. Paragraph 2 and 3 talk about Dr. Carver being born in 1860 or '61, but it isn't clear that the narration has jump anti-chronologically here.I don't know what the target age is for this book. I think a High School Freshman could handle most of it. But I had to go to a dictionary to look up the word self-abnegation.My advice? Do read a biography of the great and fascinating scientist/naturalist George Washington Carver. Don't make it this one; there are better ones out there."
positive,"What's In a Name: Just by the title alone, I didn't think that it would be something I would get anything from. However, I'd heard many women discussing this book. I discovered that I was a true ""Bitch"" (dreamgirl). I would recommend this book to any young woman (like my daughter and niece). It's very enlightening with ""in your face"" reality. Sherry has touched on some things we do in relationships, but have a hard time accepting that we are being ""doormats""."
positive,"Steinbeck at his best: Cannery Row is one of the most amazing literary achievements of all time. Steinbeck's words paint such a vivid picture of the people and places surrounding a vacant lot in Monterey that you will almost smell the fish rotting on the beach and hear the music coming from the lobby of the Bear Flag Hotel. The people of Cannery Row don't do much all day, and they never really achieve anything, but Steinbeck portrays them so magically that by the end of the story they have become archetypal heroes of greatness, honor, and beauty. This is the book that convinced me that I had to read everything ever written by John Steinbeck."
positive,"Awesome laundry rack: These things are great, after buying 2 we ended up buying 2 more. We use them to dry kid's clothes and cloth diapers (this is GREAT for drying cloth diapers that you can't dry in a dryer). They could be a little bit stronger, they tend to sag under the weight of a lot of wet shirts or pants, but otherwise they're a cinch to install and really are a great add for your laundry room, great price too."
negative,"Worst of the Series: If you enjoyed the ending of Foundation's Edge then you will probably like this book. You will find more analogies comparing Gaia to things in the isolate world, and Bliss squaring off with Trevize about stuff you really don't care about. Asimov does, however, succeed in making you feel the fustration that the characters feel when they don't discover ANYTHING about Earth for the first 450 pages. The most annoying character is Fallom. I found myself wanting Trevize to kill Fallom as he suggests he will do several times in the book. The ""twist"" revealed in the last sentence is all but a surprise as Trevize foreshadows it several times in the book. I just read a review that this was more part of the Robot series than the Foundation series. I had only read the first four Foundation novels so perhaps that is why I didn't care for the portion of the book where they meander through space accomplishing nothing."
negative,"Great magazine, but not from Amazon...: Come on, the cover price is only $8 USD. You can still purchase it at any comic book dealer and probably most book stores that have the ability to special order magazines as well as books.It's a great magazine but, unless you don't have a choice, don't pay Amazon their extortion prices for it..."
negative,"Other products are better: If this is the only swaddle blanket you have ever used i can see saying its tje greatest thing ever, however its not my first one. This product is much more difficult to put on and certainly not as diaper changing friendly as they make it sound. You have to undo the inside velcro then attempt to put it back again after. Also, my very sneaky 7 week old easily wiggles his arms free so that his hands are poking out the top then wakes up. My kids are very long and they, at 7 weeks and only about 8.5 lbs, are already almost too tall for this product.The reason I bought these was because the halo fleece sleepers got too warm with wood heat but I must say even too warm the halo sleepers are a million times better! I got size small which my boys are swimming in amnd I can still wrap them more tightly and change them easier.These are definately not my favorite by far, I think I swaddle with a blanket better."
positive,Fantastic movie: A gripping story. Superbly acted. Beautifully shot. DeNiro's directorial debut is a stunning masterpiece. It captures a volatile moment in time with an unblinking eye and a sentimental heart.
positive,"Un-FREAKING-Believable!: Pampers Small Bibsters with Leakproof Liner, Sesame Street characters, 20-Count, INCREADIBLE, not just for kids, I bought these for my wife at christmas. They were a massive hit at our latest house party. Fun for ALL the family, especially GIBBONS!BUY THEM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
negative,"Awful: I own the Bose QC2. The QC2 sounds great, but they are big and carry-on space is always at a premium. I wanted to try the smaller Sennheiser 300's. They are smaller, but they do not do a good job of cancelling out the noise. The right side was particularly bad. It seemed that the noise of the engines ""leaked"" through. I recommend avoiding these."
negative,"highfalutin drivel: I was looking forward to diving into this collection after reading so many positive reviews. Sunday Times writes: ""He is admirably equipped to write spiritual biography for the plain man, for his outstanding gift is clarity"".My answer to that review and this book is this: Unless you are a scholar you soon will find yourself drowning in a morass of words you most likely have never heard before or never use in everyday life. The problem with highly intelligent people, like C.S Lewis, is this: they do not know how to communicate their ideas in plain language so that ""plain"" people can understand what they're saying. I call that ignorance.These books are mostly filled with highfalutin, pompous, non-sensical drivel.Unless you are highly intelligent don't waste your money."
positive,"Unabridged and Awesome: This is a very attractive edition of this book. The physical dimensions of the book itself, it's quite large, make it very easy to read. Additionally, the large plot-driven engravings found in the book are beautiful and the smaller engravings found at the top and bottom of each page are also very attractive. The fact that this book is Vernes' unabridged edition may turn some readers off, as he does go on ad nauseam, about the inner workings of the machine. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the detail he provided."
negative,"Warmer??: As usual did extensive research before purchase. The product lives up to its name as a ""Warmer."" If you want to keep your drink luke warm this is the item for you. However, it will not keep coffee hot."
positive,Book Lover: Angelina's Birthday is a sweet book. My little 4 year old loves the ups and down of Angelina's little life and that she makes it out alright. Of course that there is some ballet involved always helps :) It is a nice little book.

I think I'm gonna buy another.Pros:solid, waterproof constructionextremely helpful collection of knotsinstructions are clear and easy to followCons:none"
negative,"a really bad and confusing book: Students in search of a good book on financial statements should look at ""The analysis and Use of financial statements"" from White/Sondhi/Fried. Professor Stickney seems more interested in making money than in writing a decent book"
positive,"Helpful Information: I found this book extremely helpful in identifying ways to help my gifted twins, one of whom is a traditional learner and the other is not. The book has great insight and information, plus plenty of real-world examples of how parents deal with issues unique to gifted children. One puzzling thing, though, was the notion that there's an anti-gifted bias and that parents of gifted children are somehow seen by educators as meddlers or pushy parents. The author also seems to have the idea that public schools don't know how to deal with gifted children. That hasn't been my experience so far (our public school has an excellent GT & HGT program) and don't expect it to be as my children get older."
positive,"Good Movie!: The Skulls has just enough twist and turns to make it a fairly interesting thriller. The basic story is about a struggling college student (Joshua Jackson) and what happens when he is invited into a secret society called The Skulls. The character development is somewhat weak but Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker, Leslie Bibb and Craig T. Nelson pull off their respective roles and make this an enjoyable film. Give this one a chance, it is worth it!!"
positive,"Solid story and plenty of action: I have to caveat this review by saying that I wasn't familiar with the comic or graphic novels of this character. That said, I really enjoyed the movie and felt that it blended historical and mythological themes regarding heaven and hell well. The beginning when the primary relic that the film focuses on is found was particularly weak, however all of the characters had at least a few good moments with most of them being recognizable without being cliches.Keanu Reeves has more of an edge in playing John Constantine than in most of his previous efforts, but you'll still find yourself waiting for him to call for George Carlin pick him up in his transdimensional telephone booth ala ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"""
negative,"You get what you pay for: You get what you pay for. I have used these batteries as back up for the original Canon one. After 10 months with only occasional use, battery won''t take or hold a charge. Do you self a favor, and buy a Canon battery. You'll save money in the long run."
negative,"Blah: I bought this cd thinking it was by the band Prime STH. I listened to it anyways since i had just purchased it and it was now part of my collection. I was unfortunately very disappointed. The singer's voice is high pitched and annoying. I couldnt even make it through the entire cd. And now, i have a cd that will either end up under the bed, or in the garbage."
negative,"""HOME MADE"", Lowest Budget Film...: ********* W A R N I N G ! ************* STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE! ****This movie is pretty bad! Ultra low budget movie with terrible acting and a boring plot, which combined with a huge stuggle to stay and watch should have given this one a NEGATIVE FIVE STAR RATING!!!MONEY DOWN THE TUBES WITH THIS ONE!!!"
positive,"Quest For Fire: Movie was well acted and still as fresh & thought provoking as it was when i first saw it over 25 years ago. The director put you amomg human kind 10,000 years ago. The Mammoths were a bit too mechanical but you must remember the film was made pre- digital animation. Anyone who is remotely interested in the prehistoric will enjoy this film."
negative,"the ubearable pain to watch: This movie is the lamest peice of pseudo-intellectual crap I have ever seen. It is painfully self-serious and a major bore. This is porn for those who would never confess that they watch porn. If you want to see a good movie about human relations, go get ""Besieged"" by Bertolucci."
negative,"Bad picture quality. No way to turn of DNIe which is the biggest cause of the problem.: I had this tv for a few months now. Like someone said before picture quality is very inconsistant. It seems the longer I watch it the worse picture quality gets. Especially skin tones look very unnatural. No matter whether its HD or standard programming or DVD. I tried adjusting the picture with AVIA DVD, only marginal difference. It seems that DNIe is the reason behind bad pq however there is no way of turning it off. I even contactes samsung about this, no luck. This is a well known problem with samsung plasmas and yet they refuse to fix it. Stay away from this piece of junk."
negative,"Fur coat and no Knickers: The warmers don't keep fluid warm. I read my comments and in trying to be humorous i became inarticulate. As you can see. I purchased three of Mr. Coffee mug warmers. As one of the last of the big spenders I expected to keep coffee warmer than tepid. I know that burning houses down is not good for the Mr. Coffee image but in ""She Who must be obeyed's"" dressing room, She who rules, bedside cabinet and subserviant he, lukewarm isn't what we wanted - so she tells me. I intend to try one of another brand and see if there is a difference. Want to buy nearly unused coffee warmers - well known brand?Is this the hyper link? [...]"
negative,"should have been better...: I have always liked the movie with Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock and I was expecting a very satisfying read. Unfortunately, Practical Magic proved to be a disappointment with its bland characters, loose plot and childish, simplistic tone. Gillian and Sally are one dimensional and mostly just pathetic. Although Sally's daughters are better portrayed than the grown up characters, teenage depression is simply not enough to save a lagging story. Jimmy and his angry ghost, the aunts, the conservative little town the girls grew up and Sally's love interest have very little place in the book and this does not help either.The only real success of the novel is Alice Hoffman's ability to ""feed"" magical realism into an impossible place such as the lower middle class American suburbia. Still, this does not compensate for a story that has no charm within itself."
negative,"To contrived and therefore not plausible: I found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved. The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have. For example: The scene in which Gault (the killer) has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in. Imagine, in New York no less! Not only that, but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant. And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field. I'm sorry, but this tale is just to unbelievable. It might make a passable B grade film, but I wouldn't want to see it."
positive,"I love this book!: Twisted view of a future world, even more creepy looking at it from a time 20 years after this imaginary future... it is interesting to compare and contrast this book with reality..."
negative,This is for Becy Williams.: This episode is a diappoinment. how can you say this episode makes you feel warm and fuzzy. it made me feel cold & icey. it think this was a supper depressing episode. WARNING! THIS EPISODE MAKES YOU FEEL ANGERY & DEPRESSED! do not watch this episode if your watching the show for the first time. watch Aura Borealis this epsiode makes you warm & Fuzzy.
positive,"Better than the original: How delightful to have this classic musical, in such great quality, on a dvd which I can enjoy for years. It is better than the original."
positive,"Enjoyable: I considered this book a classic read. Having been written over 100 years ago you have to expect it to be different to books we read that have been written recently. I enjoyed reading the book but did find it to be a little tedious and far fetched in places. However, I am glad I have read it. Stevenson writes well and I would certainly like to read other books he has written."
negative,"How come there weren't any leprechauns or androids?: A lot of people criticized the acting of the little kid in ""The Mummy Returns"". I think the bigger problem was that they apparently let him (or his little brother) write the script.Maybe it would have been better if there were TWO dirigibles, or perhaps a Tarantula Queen. Just a thought.""The Mummy"" was entertaining and at least had a thread of a plot to hold things together.""The Mummy Returns"" was swill. This really made money at the box office? That's scarier than the Scorpion King!"
negative,"ZERO stars; laughable; avoid: Poorman's Posner...and you know what 95% of normal people think of HIM! Avoid.Vince PalamaraSecret Service expert, History Channel, author of 2 books, in over 30 other author's books, etc."
positive,"Nice Thick Stability Ball: Nice high quality ball. The pump isn't great, but better than I feared based on other reviews. It did the job. Ball is true to size."
negative,A Bronx Tale ( Movie): This Movie has been my Favorite Movie Forever. When I Found it Here on Amazon I was super excited. So I bought the Movie Brand New Supposley. When I opened the Movie It Turned out to be a knock off Movie you can record From Your Computer. I'm Extreamly upset to have Paid 17.99 For a Boot Leg Movie. It was wraped like other movies you find when you open it You can tell it was made in a house. I want a Re-Fund. I don't Believe in Stealing. The Humanity of people on a hustle!! Do not Buy Any Movies. I will Get word around.
positive,Great Product: The liquid that came with my Ultrasonic Jewelry Cleaner is gone and no longer made by the manufacturer. I tried this because I'm familiar with the brand name and it's great!
positive,"OMG, this is great!: I just watched it again after *years* and it's such a great movie! All the actors -- Watch for Herbert Lom (Chief Inspector Dreyfus from the Pink Panther movies) in a straight role. Colleen Dewhurst in a tiny cameo. Christopher Walken is perfect -- he does weird so well. And Martin Sheen as a glad-handing politician. Great story and neat twist at the end. Couldn't recommend it more, tho too scary for little ones. One of my favorites."
positive,"great: strong , long life, fit phone perfect, would buy again, exclent replacment for the price, thanks for the great service, yaa baby."
positive,"Julia Child at her absolute best!!!!: This is my absolute favorite cooking series on PBS. Julia Child in her own home kitchen, with some of the greatest chefs working today. Her warmth and quirky humor shines throughout, and she has a lovely rapport with many of the guests. She is genuinely enthusiastic about the baked goods, and her baker-guests are obviously thrilled to be cooking side-by-side with Julia. Truly entertaining, even if you never make any of the recipes yourself! I only wish that they would make a box-set of the entire series!!"
positive,"Welcome to Barsoom: Retired confederate soldier and southern gentleman John Carter is pursued by Indians, and through unexplainable circumstances finds himself transported to Barsoom, also known as the planet Mars. There he finds a dying planet of brutal and untamed savagery, contrasted sharply with the rich cultures of ancient races. Arriving alone, naked and friendless, ""A Princess of Mars"" tells the tale of how John Carter, with the aid of his earthly strength and agility, sets forth on an incredible adventure against enormous odds to rescue the beautiful Dejah Thoris, the incomparable Princess of Helium.One of Edgar Rice Burrough's earliest works, the first chapter in the Martian series is also one of his finest. A page turning adventure with lots of action make John Carter one of Burrough's most beloved heroes. His imagination ran wild in creating the martian landscape, and this is a delight to read for all ages."
positive,"Nice soft feel: I use this string in a hybrid stringing (with synthetic gut for crosses), and it has a soft feel. Also pretty good longevity, and sometimes very good. I don't know why sometimes the longevity is so much better, wish it was always that way, makes you wonder about the variations in the manufacturing from batch to batch. But is never bad, better longevity and cheaper than natural gut, and I don't see any extra benefit from natural gut for premium price."
negative,"Flimsy...not worth the effort!: Although, it doesn't break the bank, it is terribly disappointing. It barely stands by itself and is frustrating to both my sons, whereas all the pieces fall off or don't line up properly."
positive,"Eragon ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I really liked it,so if you haven't read it yet you really should.It's really about a boy who finds a dragon egg(he does not know at the time),and it haches and the rest is about his adventures.So you really should read it."
positive,Excellent: Finally abook about trading that expresses the thought that you should consider the trading method that suits you ..... not try and fit into a trading method. I enjoyed the way Brett wrote this book as it was full of useful information and challenged me in many parts to review my own traidng agenda. Good Book....
positive,Gift for a Saviour: The aroma presented by this massage oil has both calming and exotic flavor to the senses. As being a present worthy of the King of Kings I had never smelled the two scents in combination...Heavenly is my response and I highly recommend this for either personal massage or to bring to your own masseuse.
negative,"Not what I expected: This wasn't at all what I expected. Once I was done I understand what Anne was trying to do but while reading the book I was wondering what she was doing.It's not a bad book, just not what I expected.She spends lots of time spouting about why people become masochists. To be honest I wanted more of what went on in the club - not why they were there."
positive,"Works as desired: Not completely perfect, but reliable, and frankly, it extends the reach of my headphones. This is all I need it to do."
negative,"NOT recommended: An aimless, depressing and unrelentingly dismal movie about the mindless and emotionless lives of a group of kids. The film lacks any redeeming virtues. Having a leg amputated would be more enjoyable than seeing this movie again!"
negative,"Brutal: This is brutal. Arkin is terrible as the Chief Inspector. Clouseau is inept as a detective, but unfortunately Arkin is more inept than Clouseau in this."
positive,"Received incorrect book: I received the wrong book, so I had to take the time to mail it back. I did receive the correct book finally."
negative,"Apollo Astronaut: Trying to teach my students about space travel, and the purposes of wearing a space suit...this was much too small to use in a classroom. The details are nice but no one can see it. Overpriced and not worth it."
negative,"bad formatting: I was excited to see this as a free Kindle download. However I didn't like the formatting. The paragraphs should start with an indent of one centimeter or so, but they don't have any indent at all. It's kind of amateur."
positive,"Great Rock & Roll: Great music with a message!! Love the CD. See them live sometime.""Civil disobedience is the inherent right of each citizen. He dare not give it up without ceasing to be a man. Civil disobedience is never followed by anarchy. Criminal disobedience can lead to it. Every State puts down criminal disobedience by force. It perishes if it does not. But to put down civil disobedience is to attempt to imprison conscience."" - Gandhi"
positive,"Simply Wonderful: Being a fan of progressive rock, at first listen I didn't think much of this album because it didn't sound like there was much there. Don't make the same mistake! Don't be fooled by this album's simple sounds. They belie a complexity of story and emotion - an honesty that permeates every note on this album and is beautifully woven into a harmony of voice and guitar. This is a great album that is also well recorded - nuff said!"
positive,"Tivo is much better than your cable company's DVR: Tivo is a great service and well worth the extra costs compared to the cable or satellite company DVR. It works well, is reliable, and will truly change the way you watch tv. The downside to all this is that most Tivo boxes (except for the expensive Series3) all rely on analog cable connections. This will be a problem in the future, as cable companies move away from analog systems and to digital systems. (Of course, there are work-arounds, but they aren't very elegant or cost effective). As long as you know this limitation, and that the future of the Tivo Series2 is limited - it's the best thing since sliced bread and well worth every penny!"
positive,"Lovely, Sturdy Cover and Clear Reading Edition: There are many covers, bindings, and font options available for The Hobbit, but I found this version to be lovely, sturdy, and clear to read. It's also survived my overzealous seven-year-old, and that, in itself, is quite the feat.As for the actual book--it's content, I mean--there are plenty of reviews about what a wonderful, rich tale Tolkien's created. I can only add to what others have said by stating that this book meant enough to me, as a child (and now as an adult) to be one of those I couldn't wait to pass on to my own children (who, in turn, have embraced it fully)."
negative,"Minnetonka women's myke fisherman sandals: Nice materials. Not much support in the footbed, sandal runs loose. I normally take at least a medium width but these sandals are really too loose and I've adjusted them to make them as tight as possible."
negative,Didn't work for my Tenia Versicolor: It may work for some but not for me. I used this product for about 8 weeks with no results.
positive,good: A very good product that i w ill recomend to my friends and family and hopfully last long and make futher binesses with v-chomp
negative,"Misleading book: It would be very easy to be lulled into a sense of false security by this book as it's coverage isn't detailed enough for the exam. The end of chapter exams were very poor. Just by looking at the sample exams available on Microsoft's Website, it was obvious that it doesn't even cover all the material required by the exam.For those pursuing certification, it would make better sense to sit the electives before doing this. That way the material for the windows architecture will make more sense."
positive,"Johnny Cash CD Murder: I rented this CD from the Library and fell in love and purchased the cd. Well written songs specifically dealing with poverty, prison system, captial punishment, suicide, man's inhumanity to man."
positive,"diapers on a budget: I like to purchase Pampers Diapers from Amazon. I get a much better deal for the amount. The diapers work well for our son. They aren't bulky, either. It is so nice to just order them online and have them shipped to our door for free! Less trips to the store to buy diapers is a definite plus when you have children."
positive,"Good Value for the Money: Pretty good value for the money. Prefer Zune's tactile interface. Not much information on how to install Videos, photos or Album Art. But should be able to figure it out from the internet. Try to keep it away from Cell phone, when I put my View in the same pocket as my cell phone it caused the View to lock up or shut down. Like the fact you can add memory with SD cards. Overall more positives than negatives."
negative,"just a nice soap: This is a nice soap, nice smell. But it had absolutely no effect on toenail fungus and foot itching. I really do not understand where all the extremely positive reviews come from..."
negative,"This is not the Jack Higgins I know: This is by far his worst effort that I've read. He's not my favorite spy author,anyway. This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher's contract or obligation that Mr. Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry. The characters are not at all fleshed out, and the story line is too contrived. I would advise not wasting time by reading this book."
positive,"Very fun and educational: Trains, shapes and pegs - a winning combination, guaranteed to make both the child and the parent happy. Good starter puzzle for the 1 yr old range."
positive,"Great Value!: I love these diapers. They feel soft and rarely leak. Through Amazon, they are cheaper than the cheapo diapers I used to buy from the store. I also love that they are sent to my door."
positive,"A Clockwork Orange: A Clockwork OrangeStanly Kubrick's bizaare film about the nature of justice and humanity has gone down in the history books as a classic of cinema, by how much of it's reputation is down to the film itself and how much of it is due to the media frenzy it casued and its subsequent withdrawel from the cinemas? While this certainly helped, A Clockwork Orange is a very good film in it's own right. It contains several scenes of graphic violence and nudity, by the media was wrong to claim that it glorifies violence, which it does not. In fact the majority of violence is over within the first 20 minutes or so. Despite it's long length and the fact hat it occassionanly drags a bit, Kubrick's brilliant eccentricity gives this film a fascinating edge, and the storyline is effective in showing the film's powerful moral.8 out of 10."
negative,Pretty large: Not made for the delicate sized person or in smaller areas of exploration. All features are as described and rabbit is fast on slowest setting. Smaller would be better.
negative,"Do not buy. This is a BOOTLEG: Since when did Amazon have the legal right to sell bootleg CD's? I purchased this cd so I can listen to it in the car, ( I have had it on wax for 20 years)The CD is a CDR... When did Amazon buy the licensing rights to Music of Life? They are charging people $15.00 for a bunch of MP3's burnt on to a CD lmao. I give it one star because it is a CDR.."
negative,"Very disappointed: I purchased the DVD 'Smokey and the Bandit' brand new, and it came already scratched!! The last 45 minutes are unviewable. I will never again use or recommend Amazon."
positive,"The Beatles stiffest competition...The Beatles: Strangely this is viewed by some as one of the fab's weaker album's and maybe it is when compared to the conceptual cohesivesness of some others but...MY goodness Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields, All You Need is Love (musically simple but thematically a rip tide). The Beatles were always a litlle bit silly, musical Marx Brothers, blah, blah, blah, if you don't like that element of them you generally don't like them at all and ostensibly trance out to a diet of harder, darker music. Even if only for ""Walrus"" this album is great, if not ""classic"" by Beatles standards."
positive,"Excellent DVD of a great film: No need to say much about this film, it is a classic with superb performances and an excellent script. The cast are all spot-on, with Gene Hackman (one of my favourite actors) fully deserving his Best Actor Oscar.The 2 DVD set includes 2 documentaries, one 'The Poughkeepsie Shuffle' made by the BBC, and the other I think specially for the DVD release. Both occasionally overlap in content of course, but are definitely worth watching. They include interviews with Hackman , Roy Scheider and William Friedkin, and with the two NYPD cops on whose exploits the film is based.The DVD transfer is very fine for a 30 year old film. Don't worry about the atrocious grain (which almost amounts to pixellation) in the opening shot of Marseille's skyline. The rest of the film enjoys an excellent anamorphic transfer, with only slight grain visible in a few night scenes. This transfer is well up to the standard of the best DVDs of similar period films. The soundtrack is also excellent."
positive,"The Metheny guitar,a standard of excellence: This is Pat's earliest but enduringly best cd's, especially if you like a great guitar. It's one i come back to all the time,very listenable, nothing new age here, just good solid Metheny pluckin'. It's a classic!"
positive,Great movie.: If you are a fan of the Stargate series and want to see an end to the series as a movie this is a great movie and a must see and I got this fast after ordering it.
negative,warning: I made the mistake of watching this with my kids and family after church one Sunday. I had no idea there would be a rape scene! For kids stick with the Halmark version with Matt Frewer.
negative,"Difficult to follow: I'm a student and am taking a class using this book. I've found it very difficult to follow and short on explanations. Without additional resources, I would not be able to learn the material in this book."
positive,As described: The product was delivered to me as described. Got what I wanted. A sturdy dowel. Who could complain about that?
positive,"Really great 'baby book' for your 4-legged children: This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves their dogs as children. I bought one for our 3 year old adopted beagle, and am getting one for our daugher-in-law's birthday for their rottie. You can personalize it as you wish, and I have included comic clippings (Marmaduke, Mutts, etc.) that are appropriate along with the photos and have created the beginning of a great book for my best friend that I will keep forever."
positive,"Excellent for the price: This case will hold a couple full sized pistols, several magazines, and a couple boxes of ammo. I would recommend this as a cheap multi pistol case."
positive,"Great documentary.: Great movie good for any pistols fan. It goes into some of the background, etc. It's worth the money..."
positive,"finally no leaking: i've been busy cleaning up wet & messy leaks and washing dirty undershirts & clothes for 8 months when my friend suggested that i switch from luvs to pampers. now that my baby NEVER leaks onto her clothes and i have no dirty undershirts to soak i regret not having known earlier that it wasnt my baby who's messy, it was the luvs that didn't suit her no matter what size i tried. pampers are definitely more expensive than luvs but they're so worth it!"
negative,"This book make my feel bad for a moment and some tests in end have suggestions for buy more book from same publisher: As I see that, book have catchphrases and horror tricks, like dont have explanations for some tests in end of book, only comments like something as ""If you not understand it now, after all what you read, you need buy ""Science for Dummies, Math for Dummies, English for Dummies, Algebra for Dummies, Geometry for Dummies... etc""- what really agressive advertising, make peoples feel scared, stupid and affraid and make them need buy more books from this publisher...Its scare my for a moment!Most helpful for my Peterson ASVAB, what have good explanation for ALL tests. I never not bui something ""for dummies"" again."
positive,Great Book: This is one of the greatest books out there for beginners and seasoned Wiccans alike. This is the first book that I read on Wicca and it inspired me to celebrate the Goddess and the God.
positive,Very nice book: I really liked this book. It is a page turner for sure. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point.I think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel.
positive,Ageless: No one movie could do this work justice. The theme is timeless and worth reading every year! I highly recommend.
negative,"Could not finish it --- just too filthy.: This author's lack of mastery of the English language is apparent by the number of times she feels compelled to use the ""F"" word. For some reason, I had never read this popular book when it came out --- now I know why!"
positive,FABULOUS! A MUST FOR ANASTACIA FANS!: FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS!! This CD has all the songs I love from miss Anastacia. She is so fantastic and deserves more recognition in the US. SPROCK ON ANA!!any USA Anastacia fans please contact me at Anastacia.The_Voice@yahoo.com
negative,"It could have been really good...but: Some things were good, but more were bad, here's a run down of the positive and the negative:(+)side:1.the setting of an underground cave2.couple moments that make you jump3.great concept(-)side:1.story2.cast3.troll creatures4.tried to take itself too seriously"
positive,Motorcycle Rider: It's a nice little ant to stick on your car to talk with people in a traveling group if it's tuned.
positive,"Founding Father: It is unfortunate that Washington has been reduced to an unsmiling portrait on a one dollar bill, the story that he had wooden teeth, and a fable about him fessing up to chopping down a cherry tree. Here was THE founding father of our country. In an era of great patriots: Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Henry, they chose him to be their leader. It is not unreasonable to state that if it were not for Washington there would be no United States today. Brookhiser successfully examines Washington the icon and gives us insight into Washington the man. Washington's accomplishments are staggering to consider. He had the sagacity to defeat the most powerful military force in his time AND launched a new nation that would endure throughout the ages. This book should be read by every American. In a sense he is a father to us all. I wish the book was larger in scope."
positive,"The Death Committee: Really appreciate Noah Gordon's skill with words. But this just isn't as good as his books entitled ""The Physician,"" & ""Shaman."" Sometimes one has to be in the ""mood"" for a novel...I did enjoy ""The Last Jew,"" & can't wait for his next ""Kindle"" novel. Wish I had his gift with words."
positive,"The album that made a lover out of me: Sleepwalker captured and held my heart the first time i heard it. It's the record that turned me onto this truely fantastic band. These guys are the best of our generation, they are making history. This album is absolutely beautiful. Jakob Dylans songwriting is as always, flawlessly crafted. and Pure genius!!If you don't have this album already, get it!!! :) You will be blown away!!!"
positive,"Funny! (No, really): No. Really. Most ""funny"" books I read, just aren't. David Sedaris is the real thing. This is a deeply pleasurable book about family, life, homosexuality, cultural difference, and the incidental details that pass most of us by but in Sedaris' hands are grist to his humor mill.The finest parts of this memoir/cultural investigation concern his family. And Sedaris is cursed/blessed with a family that is stranger than most. His understated prose is delightful and his self-deprecating humor (he visits Ann Frank's house, suffers real-estate envy, and finds another stick with which to beat himself) saves him from accusations of fatuousness.This book made me laugh out loud and envy the lightness of touch that Sedaris brings to everyday tales of family dysfunction."
positive,Piercing!: Camus may be lacking in the fineries of a more developed intellectualism but that is what makes this work dear to me. It is not for reading but for absorbing.
negative,"Disappoionting, Cliche, Predictable, and Poor Materials: I'm quite a fan of Patterson's books. To read this kind of poor plot crap was a waste of time! The story was nice if putting in one or two sentenses, but to make a book it ought to have a better research and twists than this! The worst of his books I've read by far!This is a complete junk, lame story. Mind as well read a gossip column from National Enquirer!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"The walking Dead and the people who love them: Not the most technically sound writing in publication but very far from the worst. For zombie fans, there really is no such thing as a bad zombie story, but David Moody's work really is something special. Its not your run of the mill flesh eating frenzy type of story and that's refreshing. The Autumn novel's power resides not in their ability to disgust or in the description of violence, but in the psychological despair and utter hopelessness that would be felt by the survivors of a zombie apocalypse. Very emotional, very disturbing, utterly wonderful."
positive,"This book changed my life!: Dr. Richard Eby has experienced many miracles in his life. But his story of life after death changed my life. He falls off a balcony and splits his head open. They rush him to the hospital and thinking he is dead they sew his head up without cleaning the wound. God shows him a glimpse of heaven. Afterwards he cannot remember the the fall. Later God lets him relive the fall to be able to tell others about the experience. A few years later while visiting the Holy Land. He enters the Tomb of Lazarus and everything goes dark. God speaks to him and tells him that he showed him a glimpse of heaven, now he will show him a glimpse of hell. His story is amazing! I saw him on a television show telling his story in 1979. I then went out and bought his book. It gave me the desire to start reading my Bible. Which is the greatest book of all!"
negative,"Well.......: Nicole Kidman is a good actress. I actually liked her before I saw this movie. Depressing story, depressing scenery, unlikable characters. Enough said."
positive,"Nice Job!: I received this CD as a gift at Christmas and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised how good this recording is and enjoyable to listen to. If I had not received ""Measure of a Man"" as a present, I have to admit I most likely, would not have bought it. Only having gained my knowledge about Clay from the constant media barrage during the ""American Idol"" frenzy and having only seen the final episode of the contest, I really had not heard much from this singer before the CD. I do admit I was impressed by Clay during the ""Idol"" finale (and, yes, he clearly deserved to win as Ruben, although a seemingly nice fellow, sings out of tune). ""Measure of a Man"" is a solid collection of pop rock and a nice showcase for Clay's pleasant tenor. His voice, though a bit generic, shows some good stylistic touches that really help to elevate the quality of the material.A good job by Clay Aiken all around and a very listenable CD."
negative,"okay..: it's okay, I just bought it for one pattern. The rest leave a bit to be desired. If you are young, maybe...."
positive,"Fantastic: Without a doubt the best movie of 2000, and an Oscar contender. All aspects of this movie are gorgeous-the scenery, acting, soundtrack, costumes, I could go on but see it and you'll understand."
negative,"Wow.: Is this book boring or what? I got through the first 100 pages with great difficulty (it was hard to keep from falling asleep) but it didn't get any better. So, I bagged it. I have no idea what the hype was about. I have enjoyed sci-fi and fantasy books before, so that wasn't the problem. It just happens to be a very tedious book."
positive,"Religion and profits: An excellent scholarly book. Great detail and very in depth analysis. Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy, not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises, for most of its adherents, Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life, dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it. Writing is very formal, not the easiest read and surley apporpriate only for the truly intersted in the general topic, but it was well worth it for this reader."
positive,"Stay FOr The Credits!: As ben stiller says staying for the credits is always a good thing. In this movie fat white goodman dances to ""My milkshake"" at the end of the credits!"
negative,dodge this movie: this film is retarded. what a waste of ben stiller's talent.i cant believe i allowed my bf to make me sit thru two hours of this torture in the theatre. i want to scream every time i think about it.
negative,review: Good for building tube amp for hi-fi applicationsAlso writen in UK so there are some minor differences that need to be addressed if building in USA
positive,"Two fro the price of one: This CD is actually two original albums put together for one CD. The first half is what I consider a small Big Band. With other Sax players, trumpets and guitar. The second half is the Rollins Trio. With that said I simply Love this CD., Grand Street is my favorite song, it instantly lights up the whole room. The sound is tight and powerful. I do prefer the first half with it's rich full sound. The second half is good but less attention getting. The playing however is excellent. For a great mix of styles and sound on one CD your cannot lose with this one."
negative,Counter active: Easy to apply over warts that are bigger than a tiny pad offered by Dr. Scholl's however it seems that it's absorbed by your skin without any effect. I had much much better results with a duck type. Save yourself some money and get liquid form not this vaseline texture product.
negative,"pass on ""Passengers"": I really liked the movie's concept and the artistic director's beautiful and tight color scheme but overall this movie is **not worth** your time or money. The director claimed this was a ""medical thriller and a romance"" but it was neither exciting nor romantic. The main character Claire falls ""in love"" with a pushy passenger named Eric who challenges her to step outside of her safe box. There's nothing wrong with this idea per se but Eric was arrogant and reckless and I just couldn't see a smart and sweet girl like Claire falling for him. The characters spent a lot of time running around in circles -- the script needed more momentum and direction. Thumbs down!!!"
positive,"I actually sought out this seller again because of the results I had with first purchase: I tracked down my invoice from a year ago so I could find this seller again, and when I found them was surprised to see the negative reviews. I bought 25 lbs in Sept. 2010 and due to personal circumstances was not able to start growing any wheatgrass until this summer. I just did two trays, with 2 cups of seed per tray, soaked and then germinated for 3 days in the dark. I had good thick trays of grass, and most importantly it was so deliciously sweet! This was my first time growing wheat grass and it smelled so strong and bitter when I juiced it-- I was concerned, thinking it would taste awful. But it was so sweet to the taste. I was later told by an old pro that some say the sweetness is due to the seed, which brings me back to why I sought out this seller again. Obviously, I can't be guaranteed that the next 25 lbs will be equally sweet since it's a year later and likely a different harvest, but I hope so!"
positive,"Avery 2 pocket folders: Great product - great service. ;-)delivered fast, what I ordered, would recommend.thank you - good luck. Not much else to say about it. gg"
positive,"Transformers, The Movie: This movie shows the great showdown in one of the greatest 80's animated series. In this movie you can expect the unexpected. This is an animated movie that can be enjoyed by people from any age. The soundtrack (which is 80's rock) makes you feel like you are watching the movie in the 80's again."
positive,"Extremely fast shipping and a great price!: I recieved this in less than 2 days. Bought this for the fiance for his birthday, he's not use to wearing rings but i wanted to point out that this ring is pretty wide and thick, he'll just have to get use to it. Its a great product and an even great price!"
positive,"E book: I put this on my tablet to read. I never read a real book, but enjoy ebooks, no clue as to why."
positive,An Endearing Tale: I have seen the video twice for this story and did not realize how much was not included until reading the book!This is a timeless classic. It reminded me of Angela's Ashes butwith greater sensitivity.Do not let this one pass you by.
positive,"Labeling Life: With all the needs of computers, there are so many great pieces of software we honestly need to use for everyday life, and creating labels in honestly one of them. With the Printshop Business Card & Label Creator, it absolutely works very well as you can easily make and design labels of any kind. You can make labels for your needs and wants like creating and designing your own address labels for shipping packages, to setting up ordinary setups for when you need to send out traditional letters. But, my favorite featureon this software is that you can actually design create C.D. labels for jewel cases, for when you design your own music albums. It is a convient buy, and works great with Windows XP, as well as a good job on Vista. It works just as well as those more expensive label making software discs. I absolutely recommend this a whole lot.Price: B 1/2+Convience: B+Overall: B+"
negative,"A peculiarity from Poverty Row.: The oddities of this Monogram semi-horror film begin with the title! The ""ghost"" in question is NOT invisible, and is not really a ghost. Also, the shadow of an ape appears on the main title card. (Don't ask me, I'm only the reviewer.) The various plot twists contain no supernatural or science fiction elements, and yet are even less plausible than those of other Monogram horrors. The director, Joseph Lewis, displays almost none of the talent he showed in his later films. Only the presence of Bela Lugosi makes this one worthwhile. The role of ""Dr. Kessler"" is a Jekyll/Hyde character, so Lugosi is playing a normal, likeable guy during most of his screen time, which makes this one of his more unusual roles. Also, Clarence Muse is good as the butler."
negative,"Bizarre and braindead: THis movie is one of the dumbest that I have seen in a long time. It is completely lacking in sense or logic. THe beginning was cool becase of Rammstein, but it went downhill from there. Its fine for a movie to have attitude, but this was just too over the top. And the acting was pretty bad, too. No doubt that it is a showy film, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like dumb action movies."
negative,"Better off buying something from Afc Adam, Gambler, or love systems: Book shows some decent advice, but alot of weird stuff that men often SHOULD NOT DO!... many openers of creating small conversations but in the most weirdest circumstances... nothing simple just technical... book has its uses for beginners... my advice buy it read it but RETURN it! your better off with Afc Adams, Gambles, Kezia Nobles books... down to the point and direct!"
positive,"good movie: It is worth to watch, good story, scaring but also attractive, should it is very good for friends' gathering, all ppl watch together"
negative,"A Disappointment: A lot of words defined here, but still not complete. Mine is the 2003 V3.0 version and it does finally include ""internet"" -- but don't bother looking for ""blog"" as it is not there. Could the etymologies and histories be more complete? Yes. Other criticisms I read of this CD are also on the mark, as, for example, the absence of many of the print-version illustrations.There are a lot of search options that could be helpful. One of these claims to find homophones (homonyms). This version will find neither ""bow"" for ""bough"" nor ""ruff"" for ""rough"".Still a useful item for many purposes, but complete or unabridged it's not."
negative,"What's happening to Maxis ?: Is this game called the sims 2 ? it's really amazing.Everything that is great in the sims 2 (PC) is certainly not in this game.What makes the sims 2 so exceptional (compared to the previous versions)is the idea of generation !!! and in this game, no generation, no grandparents, no children...where's the point in playing the sims 2 and having 2 adults kiss for days? SUddenly it seems that Maxis have lost all genius. Can I have my money back ?"
negative,"well, I'll never get that time back: If you're looking for some insights into fashion and/or the fashion world, look else where. I thought I'd gain some insights to the world of fashion (an area of life that I'm not famailiar with) but I was very disappointed. Nothing but nothing in this book had to do with fashion, the fashion business, nor the intellectual exercise that goes into fashion. This was simply the rambling lifetime memories of a well respected player from the fashion field. Childhood, young adult, married, Europe, here, there, everywhere... if you like name dropping (and I admit she did drop some impressive names) - this book is for you. If you're looking for some insights into fashion and/or the fashion world, look else where."
positive,"A great inexpensive workout routine: Gilad is a great motivator. I feel like I'm right there with his group on the beach and I don't want to let them down. For some reason I want to give my best even though I'm in pain from the unrelenting reps. But, at the same time, it's fun.After two weeks of doing one segment a day, four days a week I could tell a difference in my tone, strength, and endurance. Plus, I just felt better.Some may do the whole work out, but I have found that I don't have time to spend a whole hour so I use heavier weights and do one segment each day. The results have been great. It's too bad this can't be found in a dvd format."
positive,A MUST HAVE DVD: Well what can I say? This movie pleasantly surprised me and is a nostalgic and very revealing look at the 1950's Physique models. Gee these guys had great bodies and not the bulging muscles u see in todays magazines. If u are offended by male nudity steer clear of this one as it leaves nothing to the imagination. The soundtrack is great the acting above average and the crossovers to real interviews and back to the storyline is very good. Joe Dellesandro is featured in the interviews and in the bonus section of the DVD is a very revealing what u could call screen test of a very young and well endowed Joe. 10 out of 10
negative,"Save your money!: My rating is not a reflection of the greatness of Cream, rather a forewarning to prospective buyers of this compilation. Before purchasing this compilation, consider that there is a vastly better one available for near the same price! ""The Very Best of Cream"" features all of the tracks presented ""Strange Brew"", an additional 8 tracks, and more extensive liner notes. Also ""The Very Best of Cream"", released in 1995, was the first Cream best of to be released exclusively on CD, and is mastered using Apogee's UV22 encoding that vastly improves the sound quality of the original songs, and the songs on this album. Save your money and get it instead!"
positive,"Snyders Know Knots: I'm impressed by this somewhat small book on knots. Clearly, it was written by someone who has used rope and understands the topic. (Sadly, many knot books seem written by much less qualified authors--some spitting out quite a few!) The book's illustrations and guidance are good and clearly given. I recommend this book for those needing general or sailing-specific knot knowledge; for climbers/cavers, fishers, this book isn't good."
positive,"a little bigger than I thought it would be: Have only used the ball a few times. I use it for sit ups and ""gluteus work out.well made and sturdy. a little bigger than I expected but I may have filled it up a bit too much."
negative,Very Predictable: Much Like Most Bands Out Today Chumbawamba pretty Much Sounds Like every group out now.The Lead Off Song Got The Ball Rolling but the Album Sounds Like a Decade Late take on Jesus Jones.Nothing worth Seeking out here.
positive,"Love GG: I'm a big Gossip Girl fan and thought season 3 was great! Loved seasons 1, 2, 3, and 6! 4 and 5 were okay. ;)"
positive,This is the book that made me love reading...: Growing up I thought my my mother and sister were so boring because they read so much! I hadn't read anthing that interested me until Alvin. My mother and sister still may be boring at times but reading is exciting! Thank you Mr. Hicks!
positive,Great!: Thrilled to finally get this after wanting one many years ago. Came in great condition with a perfectly mint tag. Highly recommend
positive,"a really good movie!: Despite the suppossed flaws, this is a great movie! Since all films require us to enter the world of the characters, the problems with the inconsistent science behind the film matters little to me. Or perhaps, it's that we have to be able to explain every bit of a movie like this, or we feel it fails. NOT TRUE...Watch this movie. The son and father relationship is really solid and makes the movie both an emotional and exciting trip."
negative,"Chiefs: This two disc production is a very poor quality copy. It does not appear to be produced by the studio. Although it contains the FBI warning on unauthorized copying, this production appears to be exactly that. I would think the MPAA would want to look into this supplier. And, I am surprised this product was offered on Amazon."
negative,"For absolute beginners only: If you have any knowledge of Spanish vocabulary, do not buy this CD. This is VERY VERY basic, with greetings (ola, como esta, buenos dias, etc), very simple phrases, very simple words. For someone who knows NO Spanish, this might be helpful, but not to anyone else. In addition, the CD is very short, and more than half of my CD skips, making it shorter still. I was very disappointed and feel I wasted my money."
positive,"4 stars!: I enjoyed this in spite of my intense dislike for Adam Sandler movies. The film somehow manages to be genuinely funny, heartwarming and sincere, overcoming Sandler's natural tendency to go for the cheap laughs. Drew Barrymore is wonderful as the adorable amnesiac who starts each day with a fresh slate. Adam Sandler plays the smitten admirer who wins her over, only to find he is completely forgotten the next day. And the next. And the next.Rob Schneider is more irritating than funny, except for the scene where Drew beats the crap out of him, but the rest of the supporting cast is a joy to watch.You'll smile. You'll laugh. And, believe it or not, you'll root for Adam Sandler.Recommended!"
negative,"xXx: This movie sucks! How can you compare this movie which(I have read) is to depose all the James Bond movies particularly the latest Bond Movie Die Another Day? The Gadgets, The Bond Girl : Rosamund Pike compare to Asia Argento? This movie still cannot hold a candle to all Bond films including the latest release."
positive,fitness: It's very simple and straight to the point and it helps out. Gives you straight motivation and a relastic out look.
negative,"Horribly cheap construction quality: I was very disappointed with this double boiler. I purchased one, used it twice, and on the second use, the lower handle simply snapped off as I tried to lift it off the counter. On closer inspection, it appears the handle is held on with four tiny rivets. One of the four was rusted, and the handle snapped right off, sending milk all over my kitchen. Even if it hadn't been rusted, you can tell from looking at those rivets that the handle wouldn't have stood up to years of use. It's just a shoddily made double boiler. Look elsewhere, is my advice."
positive,"New Favorite Lube: This lube is absolutely amazing! It is silicone based, silky smooth doesn't get sticky and lasts forever. I have tried lube after lube, trying to find the one that would be it for the rest of time...and this is the one."
positive,"a great guide for a christian parent, or any parent: Very well written. Practical applications for implementation in your own family. I did not know how i was going to effectively teach our values to our children outside of trying to lead by example. This spelled it out for me. I have seen it work, my children are embracing these values and are developing characters any mother would be proud of. Even when they do wrong, they are usually aware of it and do apologize sincerely."
positive,Keeps me healthy and I am not allergic to this brand.: I like the Solaray Brand. I am not allergic to it. Vitamin D-3 was recommended by my doctor. The Vitamin D-3 keeps me healthy.
positive,Beautiful and a Treasure: This movie was a childhood favorite of mine! I loved the animation and story back then - even more today! The beauty and enchantment of it takes you into a wondrous and mythical world.This is a great buy and a wonderful memory to have and share with future generations. I can NOT wait to own it on dvd.Enjoy!
negative,"Not the best of the k-cup flavors: I do love my Keurig coffee machine, and have sampled a wide variety of coffee flavors they offer. This one is NOT one of my favorites. It's acidic, and that overpowers the vanilla and coffee flavors. You can do much better. The two best I've tried so far are Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry and Gloria Jean's Mudslide (chocolatey). If vanilla is your favorite flavor, I would try the Green Mountain or Gloria Jean version, or one of the others."
positive,"Good 18th Century Novel: The Vicar of Wakefield is a good book that shows how a family overcomes one harship after another. It is funny and at times very witty. Even though the language is a bit old fashioned, the book is still fun to read."
positive,"Great little mp3: I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player! Saved myself a little money and don't look like everyone else out there."
positive,"What a documentary should be: I'm not going to critique the entire documentary; others have already done so, and very well. What I will offer is my opinion that this is truly a worthwhile documentary. It is comprehensive in scope and draws facts, opinions, and stories from many people, including the band members who seem to be more approachable and reflective than ever seen or heard by the general public. The bonus disc offers fans rarely, if ever, seen performances and outtakes that have good entertainment value. Some true gems in the performances.I'm not thrilled with the disc placement in the case, but overall the packaging is nice and protective.As always, I'm very satisfied with Amazon's product fulfillment processes."
positive,"Great for Wide Feet: I purchased these in a 4E width for my grandmother, whose feet are very swollen due to medical issues. It had gotten to the point where shoes either didn't fit her or were very uncomfortable. Finally I found these and they actually fit her! She is very happy with them. They were worth every penny."
positive,"Hackman's French Connection: A must have DVD. Classic movie, classic Hackman, best car chase ever filmed.The French Connection"
positive,"Must have for fans: Instant classic. Love those toys as well, even though they're all gone now. Great animation with a wicked soundtrack. Visual and sounds are awesome on large plasma and high end sound system. Can't wait for the live action movie."
negative,"Trailer Home Cooking, or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Recipes on the Back of Pre-Packaged and Canned Garbage: Why, why, why? This woman is a talentless hack. I've seen better recipes on the back of soup cans! Sandra Lee's approach to inspired cooking is to add a can of tomatos to your Hamburger Helper! Woo! Seriously, though, this is a joke. I have nothing against easy cooking, but this is an absolute waste of time and money."
positive,"An iconoclastic look at the dark side of life.: This is a very difficult movie to watch. The cruelty of the gang is horrible but I think necessary for the rest of the movie to work. Malcolm Mcdowell gives, in my opinion, the best performance of his career and wasn't even recognized with an academy award nomination. The social commentary in this movie about violence and the establishment approach to a ""cure"" is disturbing and thought provoking. The use of of ""Singing in the Rain"" in the most violent scene and the use of the music of Beethoven throughout was brilliant and horrible at the same time. This is one of the best examples of a very unpleasant subject being shown with brilliance and genius."
positive,"Yes.: Yes, it's a great book. Yes, it's ridiculously complex. Yes, it's one of the most entertaining books I've ever read. Every character is made real; the only heroes are heroes in the simplest ways. We see into each character's mind in the most accurate depiction of the internal world ever written. It's chaos, but it's a chaos that is made sensible through the real eyes of a group of very real characters, all living their basically simple lives as heroically and humanly and mortally possible. They are people, they have flaws, they are real, part of our real world. It's an untouchable work of art."
negative,Glad I let them in!: I let the missionaries in and am forever thankful that I did. I wish I had grown up in the church--but I'm very happy that my kids are learning an important set of VALUES which they have the agency to choose to incorporate into their lives.
positive,"intro to samurai: This was my very first samurai flick that I saw when I was 11 years old with my dad. Dark and bloody, a true classic that deserves remastering and release on dvd.Cheers"
negative,"What the heck?: This movie is weird to say the least. Over all picture quality, at least on the version we have, is pretty poor for DVD. It is more like an old VHS rental or something. Sound is average at best. The movie, or movies as it is, are rather confusing. The action seems to bounce all over the place and it is not entirely clear as to what is going on most of the time. The general idea of the movie (e.g. God and Satan bartering over souls) is interesting but this movie does not pull it off very well. The only thing that keeps it remotely interesting are the short parts with gore that is so fake and funny you end up laughing your ass off (clay animation anyone?). I'd definately recommend renting this movie if possible before considering a purchase."
negative,"Bad movie - Good DVD: This was a reasonably bad movie, and the only possible reason for purchase is to test the excellent capibilities of a DVD player."
negative,Emma WILSON???: It's Emma WATSON! I mean come on! And it's Daniel Radcliffe! Not Daniel Radcliff! How could some one make a mistake like that?!
negative,Mothman Fiction: The author claims the book is factual. My gut feeling is it's fictional. As fiction it is not well written. Just a bunch of short tales kind of mixed together.
negative,Whiny. Annoying. Can't watch. Not funny.: Her antics is not very entertaining and very annoying to watch. I borrowed this dvd from the library and glad I didn't invest money but unfortunately my time. The only time i can tolerate the video is when she was actually serious and informative about childbirth.
positive,"sharks with frickin' lasers...: I was unsure about this product, I'm used to pretty high quality stuff from my friends Vladimir and Dimitri. Always such a pleasure to do business with two such lovely young men.I was pretty disappoint with using it as a an energy source, but it was extremely helpful with making my dream come true: Sharks with frickin' lasers. I can't tell you how joyous I am to finally have been able to mutate sharks to be able to accept and use implanted laser devices.I would advise you not to use it as an aid during sex though; my balls still don't feel right and I think she has a little bit inside her.Regards,Evil Scientist"
negative,"SOMEBODY PLEASE RESCUE THIS BOOK FROM ITS AUTHOR: This audio CD had me excited at first, at least until I actually played it. It's the most boring read of any story I've ever heard in my life. Golding's a great writer, but he ain't no reader. His own commentary in parts is distracting and irritating. His mouth noises unsettle me, and his slow, dull, expressionless rendering of this classaic grates on the spirit. Too bad an accomplished reader such as Roger Dressler or Garrick Hagon can't do this novel justice. It's just a damned shame is all."
positive,"Funnier Than a $6000 Shower Curtain: This book made me laugh so hard I was literally gasping for air. It totally hits a satirical bullseye and could not be more timely. I am giving it to everyone on my Christmas list.I found it hard to believe that ""Who Moved My Soap"" could live up to the rave reviews I'd read of it, but it does, and then some. Pick it up and see for yourself - you will be very, very happy you did."
positive,"Pretty Cool: Ever since going to get my eyebrows done and ending up bleeding, I have been reluctant to go get them waxed again. These work pretty well though the contour is a bit off and you may have to use more than one to get the precision that you need. They take off the hair pretty cleanly and the cold wax job lasts long enough. Plus, they're pretty cheap."
negative,WEAK: This was a first. I enjoy Grisham's books. But this one fell off hard. Perhaps at 1/3 its length it probably would have held together. It's stretched way too far. I finally quite halfway. Not unpleasant. Just mind-boggingly slow. He's not a deep writer. If he doesn't keep it moving everybody's in trouble. Way slow. Only have so much time in this world.
positive,Unh-Huh: The title says it all. I like to show this to my Landsknecht re-enactor friends. They love it. Bloody Germans!
negative,"I expected more Brian - this is a disappointment !: This CD lacks effort. Only one or two decent tracks, the rest of the tracks leave a lot to be desired. A real downer."
negative,??????: HOW is one supposed to compare/contrast this item with competitors WITHOUT EVEN SEEING IT? - don't list a product until you can post a picture/series of pictures with that listing!
positive,"A good practical reference: This book is very good with detailed lists of suggestions to try for various problems - blocked duct, underfeeding etc. It is a good reference, but for a more all around comprehensive book I prefer Nursing Your Baby by Karen and Gale Pryor."
negative,"not large and not comfortable: Even though it is described as ""large"", it is not that big I feel. Besides, the scratchy string that linking beads is not bearable."
negative,Edge of Danger: 1 star - only because that's the minimum.This book proves the famous can publish anything.
positive,"Entertaining read, interesting premise.: The previously noted criticisms of the work are accurate, but the book is a very readable piece of work which is not only fascinating, but most importantly entertaining!"
positive,"Cute!: Such a great price for an all-time fave! Can't beat it. It's a must have, for sure. I've seen it so many times but enjoy it the same as I did the first time. Some cheesey parts but definitely cute and the soundtrack is superb!"
positive,"Great Show - I was there!: Great DVD! I waited 6 hours for front row seats general admission. It was worth the wait. A very HOT show. Not only was Warhol there, but some of the members of the 80's band the Go-Go's, and Adam Ant.In the last song ""Rock & Roll"", they do a 10 second close up of me in the audience playing air guitar. My 15 minutes of fame!Lou is the grandfather of Punk and a classic Rock & Roll ICON. But this disk & enjoy."
positive,"True Steinbeck: Having read many of Steinbeck's novels, I went into this one knowing what to expect, and I was not disappointed. In some ways this book reminded me very much of Tortilla Flats, in that it's largely about poor people who make the best out of their situations. In other ways it reminded me of The Grapes of Wrath, in that there was a lot of thinly-veiled social criticism, but the socialism themes weren't overwhelming. The one thing I found to stand out more in this novel over the other two was the fact that Steinbeck's humor really had a chance to come out in this one. His humor reminds me of, perhaps, the sort of humor one might expect from a grandfather. The book really focuses in on simple living, and the ability to find contentment without wealth. I would reccommend it to anyone."
positive,"an absolute masterpiece: I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^"
negative,It's really bad ignore the reviewers on here!: Stay away from this film it's horrible after I read the reviews when they said it was better than the first one well I saw it and it sucked just like the first one did. The cast looked like they were about to fall asleep when they were making the film and it also looked like they were getting tired of doing of the series. Why in the hell do they make the trailers look so cool then I see it and I get a total rip off of good money? It sucks but anyways be smart and do not see this film it's dumb.

positive,Nokia N800 Internet Tablet: I bought this a couple of weeks ago and have to say I am really pleased with it.An added bonus is that as its Linux under the hood you can get a reasonable amount of software for it and Nokia have bundled an application manager tool with the system that makes it really easy to install new software and ensure its kept up to date.Does everything I wanted it to do!
positive,"Real gem of a movie: This is a genuinely funny and charming movie. The cast all have tremendous fun, and there's plenty of time for songs, comical, panto-type escapades and romantic interludes. Basil Rathbone, as the obligatory villain, wields a fencing sword with particular menace. This is the sort of old-fashioned entertainment we should be bringing our children up watching. Good stuff."
negative,Nothing against Mandy Moore but...: Do humanity a favor and listen to the orginal versions of these songs.
negative,Horrible Service: Do not purchase from this seller. Horrible service. It took them over a month to ship me my filter and didn't even compensate me with free shipping. When I asked what the hold up was they told me they left me a voice message (which they didn't) and that my order would be reshipped due to shipping failure. This was their fault and I didn't even receive an apology. Very disappointed and will never purchase from them again.
negative,Only one disc (Disc 2): Beware:People are advertising this product and only delivering beat up copies of Disc 2 only.Caveat Emptor!Buyer Beware.
negative,not well made.....: The ring was beautiful when I received it...but one of the stones fell out in the first few days....so I can't wear it any longer....
positive,"If I was stranded on a desert island with one album...: If I was stranded on a desert island with one album it would be this one. One deep complex song after another. Put on the headphones, close your eyes and take a trip into a world where the beat never ends and melodies play with your emotions."
positive,"The best story that portrays christmas tradition: The Christmas story is one of the most well know stories in history. It is not just a story, it shows how people should, and shouldn't act on Christmas holiday. The Christmas story is a great book, and even though it is old, it is still popular."
positive,"funniest movie i have ever seen... my favorite comedy: this is by far the best comedy ever created. i wtch it at least twice a week... at least. look, as everyone said, the movie is extremely quotable, hilaroius sand real,. etc. but please guys, dont make reviiews giving away all of the bloody funny spots. you'll ruin it! for ur own good, do notlook a the review made on nov. 21 titled mike judge kin of comedy, its horrible, its a movie critic gone to giving away secrets... peace"
negative,Disappointing: After all the good reviews I read of this book I thought I would love it. Usually I enjoy biographies. I found that this book is written in a style that makes the story a bit difficult to follow. I gave it my best shot but I did not enjoy it at all.
positive,"Excellent hanging system!: We own a beautiful and unique 100 lb, 5 ft x 4 ft mirror. We attempted hanging it with picture wire and multiple mirror hangers. No success. The hooks ""groaned"" and then tore out of the wall leaving ugly holes. Welcome the HP-30 Heavy-Duty Mirror and Picture Hanger. It installed easily and is supporting our mirror in style."
negative,"I must be on something: I did not receive this one but did get the other two games that supposedly came in the same package weird, I'll keep searching for the lost artifact, but who knows what really happened."
positive,"Keeps 'em dry, as promised.: I'm a mother of 4 children under the age of four, 3 of whom are in diapers. I talk to a lot of moms, and for some, Huggies is the brand of choice, but for my kids, I always have relied on Pampers. Every time my kids wear another brand, those diapers prove to be unreliable (and somewhat disasterous). Pampers have always worked on my skinny-bummed children, all of whom are tall and not ""built like bricks"" or on the chunky side. I highly recommend these diapers."
positive,"Excellent Reading: Excellent reading material for middle school students. Humorous but also touching. Favorite character was Bob Cratchit. Good job, Charles Dickens."
negative,"A few moments of truth amidst a lot of silliness.: This movie has a few poignant lessons borrowed from Arthurian legends and the Don Quixote story--but read the originals instead of wasting time on this slow-moving film that is mostly filler between a few good scenes. By the time the Jeff Bridges character broke into the castle to steal the Grail, I no longer cared if he made it or what would happen if he brought it to Robin Williams.Good performances by Jeff Bridges and Mercedes Rhuel, just wish they'd had better material to work with. Robin Williams plays the type of character we're familiar seeing him do--zany, devil-may-care, society's-opinion-be-damned guy who tries too hard to make you love him."
positive,"Soooooo goooood!: The film was all set up for a sequel, but it never came. Maybe that's not such a bad thing considering the Matrix and Prophecy sequels. This is a classic!"
positive,A little hard to follow but I like it!: I had to read this 2 times to catch on to what was going on (I don't think I was paying enough attention). It's wasn't one of those books that I couldn't put down although it was very good.
positive,"Curve: It smells like Gap heaven, Very nice. Beautiful color and scent! Can't wait to try Curve Crush when i'm done with this one."
positive,"Very handy item!: I find that the boppy pillow is very handy. It is soft and comfortable, our baby loves his. I gave 4 stars bc I found that it was difficult to breastfeed with (awkward). Our dog even loves to lay in the boppy. I recommend this product highly."
negative,"Rare case where the book is NOT better than the movie: I got the book after having watched the movie twice. Nora Ephron's movie makes Julie Powell out to be a quirky, fun person who takes on a daunting task, perseveres through many challenges, and learns life lessons from following in Julia Child's giant footsteps. Nora also splits her screen time between the two characters, drawing interesting comparisons between the two women.Unfortunately, Julie Powell's character in the book comes off as whiny, self-centered, alcoholic, and intolerant. In the movie, Julie is thrilled and amazed that people start reading her blog and commenting. In the book she scorns her readers, amazed that anyone would waste their time. The way she mocked their interest in her blog was unpleasant, along with her lack of respect for her long-suffering husband. I read about a third of the book, but there are too many good books I haven't read yet to waste more time on this one."
negative,"Missing Custom House: My daughter needed this book for school and specifically needed an edition with the custom house. We ""looked inside this book"" on line and it shows that it includes the custom house. When the book arrived, it did not include the custom house. Very disappointed as we took the time to check and she needed this for class."
negative,"Save your money: This is a 6 x 4.5 x 0.5 inch book that is basically the federal rules with SOME objections. So far the description doesnt sound so bad right? But then throw in that this tiny little booklet is $35.00 bucks. If you buy this, and some of you will, you will be shocked at how tiny this book is with large print running you 35 bucks. I got a required book on the federal rules and a book on objections that total $70.00 and both on their own are worth more than this. Get something else if you can. The books I purchased instead of this are below.[...]"
negative,Disappointed: I am disappointed with the mop. It has been ackword for me to handle. The pad just swivels round and round as I try to get into corners or just move in a straight line. Not as all what I was expecting.
positive,"Compelling, wonderful film: I remember when seeing two women together, supporting and caring for each other was very, very rare. The most compelling part in this movie is where Lillian and Julia meet in the cafe. Julia tells Lillian that she has named her daughter for her. Julia finally reaches over and puts her hand on Lillian's and says ""My beloved friend. Go!"" Yet another potent reminder of the courage of the Resistance fighters in the face of Nazi terror. Jason Robards is incredible, and for those of us who grew up near Long Island beaches, it's a wonderful recollection of them. Buy it for your daughters."
negative,"It made me very sad...: Good God! This was the first book of Ms. Garwood I ever looked at and I swear it will be my last! I can't believe something so shallow and unbelievably cheezy still gets published! All the characters do is look at each other, sigh, rapidly hug and kiss and realize over and over and over that they are in love...It was so tacky I couldn't force myself to finish. This is housewife's bliss! All that's missing is Fabio on the cover."
positive,"Sacred Music! Intense!: This music is so special - describing it in terms of what instruments are played does it a disservice. If you are looking for light, fluffy pop music, don't bother. But, if you want to be transported to Celtic Britain, or would like to have a spiritual experience that has roots in the sacred Earth and takes flight, then this cd is a must! Intensely powerful, beautiful, sacred music."
negative,letters from home: i like letters from home cuz it tells a story that if you really listen you can acctually hear john michael montgomery tell his story of soldiers and all that stuffi liked it and i like punk rock and rock so it must be good if i like it
positive,"A good game that became a smash hit movie1: As any Mortal Kombat fan should know that this movie rocks.It has great fight scenes,special effects,acting,diolouge and also some swearing.It is too bad that Rayden cannot enter the fight because of the writer.Whats up with that.They could of at least let jax have one fight scene.And I thought that Lui-Kang entered the tornement to represnt Kung Lau.But thats ok because the fight scenes are cool and so is the acting.Just to let you know that this is way better than part 2 of this.This movie has an unforgetful ending.Unlike the other."
positive,"My review: I think that the ""Heart of a Jaguar"" is a very good book but I do think that it could be better. I like the plot, setting and the characters but I was very disappointed with the ending. The ending shouldn't really be the end of Balam's life because the book gets exciting and it is good. When he has to be sacrificed it abruptly ends the whole story. It made me sad even if it was just a book.If Talbert agreed to change the ending a little bit, but wanted to keep the main idea of Balam getting sacrificed, I have some advice for him. I think maybe he should explain it in a different way. It was almost too scary and gross. If he agreed to change the whole thing, I think the rain should have come and everyone would be happy."
negative,"kinsey: a rapist by proxy: a movie about a disgusting man that exploited the innocence of CHILDREN to further his research. a disgrace to humanity, and a disgrace to the political left."
negative,"Tiny Print: Seller did a great job getting this to me in a timely fashion, no complaints there; however, the text within the book is terribly small, looks like someone zoomed out and then printed all the pages, they don't even fill the page normally (2 inch margins on the left and right and 3-5 inch margins on the top and bottom). Was excited to get the book, but not very excited about the print size"
positive,To intense for me: I thought that the book was ok. I like sci fi books but this got to deep and intense. I enjoyed the book at some points. Like when Jessica became the revrend mother and she was pregnent and her daughter got all the memorys too. And every one thinks that she is a streange child. I like the idea that she killed the Barron. You dont see many 3 year olds doing that. I thought that the book was ok for being a sci fi book. But I dont think that I will continue on with the other novels.Thank you. Francie
positive,"Fantastic: Hello. I think that this Cd is 2002 best cd (well, maybe the second, after Springsteen). The songs are very good (they are 8 new songs, very good, songs). My favorites are: All the things she said and Show me love. The rest (30 seconds, not gonna get us, malchik gay, clowns, Stars) are, also, great. There is a new version of ""how soon is now?"", a very good songs for this girls' voices. Well, the songs are fantastic, but THE BEST of the cd is Julia and Lena's voices; THEYR VOICES ARE INCREDIBLE. Please, belive me, YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS CD NOW !!! NOW!!!. Thank you, and TATU FOREVER."
positive,"great!: very good book. read it for school, but it was definitely worth it to read it. good story line that kept me interested through all the plot twists"
negative,"Does not follow the book much. Had to insert all the PC garbage.: Not bad entertainment...but the book is better, at least according to my wife who chose the movie after reading the book."
positive,yummy: their not only good for you but their yummy.they smell like cloves when their cooking and taste a little sweet.
negative,This device sux: I got one of these awhile back and been having trouble ever since. More then 80% of the time it won't read my CD or a CD with mp3's on it. So as a last resort I put in a usb flash drive. Well it reads the small drive like a 256 mega bytes but it can't read my 2 gig flash drive. I bought this machine for work so I wanted a long playing device but forget it. I hate it.
negative,"A huge disappointment.: Bland rip off of a great comic book not only puts the worse actor imaginable for the main character but has a script that is almost a crime in itself. The dialog is so bad that it would even make deaf children cry and the special effects are not as good as one might hope. Some of the acting is great and that's a great feat in itself because of how bad the script is. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton do great work here and for that, people should be grateful for but it's still Keanu's film and he still torpedo it with a lousy performance that is in tune with the lousy script it has.If this is the best they have to offer for the fans of the comic book, then take it back."
negative,"THIS IS WHY ACE AN PETER LEFT KISS..........: AFTER 1977 KISS LOST ITS CHEMISTRY AND ACE AND PETER DIDNT HAVE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BE WITH GENE AND PAUL...THERE ARE SOME GOOD SONGS ON HERE........BUT THAT DOES NOT JUSTIFY A GREAT ALBUM......The opening track and within and we are one are the highlights.This album lacks focus, and Paul probably did his worst songwriting since HOT IN THE SHADE.This album is overproduced, like UNMASKED, and UNMASKED is better.It tries to have a theme like the ELDER with the Circus thing and the ""we lover our fans songs"".It tries to be commercial like CRAZY NIGHTS.So...if you like Unmasked and Crazy Nights and Hot in the Shade I recommended...if you want the real kiss listen to KISS thru Love Gun, the 3 solo albums sans Criss, Dynasty, Creaturs, Lick it Up, Revenge and Unplugged...okay?OKIT'S OBVIOUS KISS MAKES BETTER MUSIC WITH SINGER AND KULICK...IT'S A SHAME CUZ THE FIRST 3 ALBUMS AND ALIVE ARE TRULY AMAZING..."
negative,"twaddle-dee-twaddle-dum: Prose that would make a Dungeons and Dragon novel blush, boring , narcassistic characters, plot goes nowhere...1 star"
negative,"What a piece of [junk]!: This book is purely worthless. It contradicts itself, has numerous errors, and covers about 50% of the exam. You'd be better off spending your money on some yoga and meditating about passing the exam. The only reason I passed is because I already had my A+, Network+, and I-Net+."
negative,"Really boring!!: Although I love Luke Wilson ( I love you Luke!!!) I didn't like this movie at all. I hope to see Luke soon in a good movie. I fell in love with him the instant I saw him in 'Bad blood', an X-files episode. And this episode was written by Vince Gilligan, as is the movie so I gave it a try... Total disappointment!! I expected a lot better from my fav. X-files writer Vince Gilligan. Also, I didn't like Drew in this movie, I think I'm just fed up of seeing her in the same role over and over again."
positive,"Impressive: I was greatly impressed by this book. It has opened my horizons and gives me new hope for the future. The Purdues have laid out a road map on how to live longer and feel better. They point out that age is largely a state of mind and give advice on how to make adjustments so getting older is not a terrifying idea. Thanks a lot, Purdues!"
negative,"Pretentious: Found it stupid and annoying. This pretends to be a documentary made 5 million years into the future sent back to the present day, supported by bad computer graphic fantasy animals. In a word, pretentious."
positive,nice smell but very strong.: This is a sweet smell and I like it but it is very overpowering. I only put the lotions on my arms and one spray on me and it could give me a headache at times. Go easy on this stuff.
positive,Great for starting ASP!: This is a good book for someone begining to learn and develop using ASP. I learned a great deal alot from the examples. Good value
negative,"The last nail in the coffin of a dead genre: Well, I think it's safe to say that rap-rock has completely ran it's course and come full circle. There is now officially nothing new to do and if you try it anymore, you are just treading territory already cleared by dozens of other bands. When I first heard ""Stick Em Up"" I was amazed. I thought ""Wow, maybe there is hope for rap-metal."" So I went out and bought the CD expecting great things. First off, like every other reviewer mentions, these guys want to be the Beastie Boys so bad, but believe me friends, these guys can't even hold a candle to the Beastie Boys. This whole CD is dreadfully boring, and now ""Stick Em Up"" is starting to sound just a little to manufactured. Nothing caught my ear on this CD, I was just so bored. I always try to sit through at least one full sitting of every CD I buy, but this was torture! I do not recommend this CD at all."
positive,"An Excellent Book that all Christians should read: This is an excellent book, very analytical and exacting. It'll open the eyes of many good Christians, if they will only open their minds to the truth. I strongly recommend this book to anyone that's interested in the truth about the Bible."
positive,"He's hilarious... to me at least.: Setting the standard for what the autobiography is today, Franklin tends to be much funnier than what people expect him to be. He maintains grounded with self deprecating phrases and a modest tone although with all his achievements as one of 'Merica's founding fathers you think he'd earned the right to boast a bit. It was a fun read and I'm glad I was forced to read it in class. A bit short for my liking though."
positive,"good: well, if you like MTV and you cannot go a week without looking at bright clothing, and your biggest fear is having to spend time in the country, you will not want to listen to this album. If you have any idea what it means to listen to music with a purpose, even if that purpose is not readily explainable, you should like this stuff. I like Will oldham so that may have alot to do with my appreciation of this album and anything that sounds like this. Maybe?"
positive,"Great swing: The reviewer who put down Robillard's playing on this has got to have his head up his you know what! Duke Robillard really demonstrates his swing chops on this one - Duke is a master of many styles including blues in the style of the likes of T-Bone Walker, Albert Collins, Magic Sam, you name it - and jazz in the style of Charlie Christian - He has a very hard hitting swinging style and he comes up with interesting musical ideas in each of his solos. Herb, of course, is a terrefic soft-spoken jazz guitarist. Like Jim Hall he always has subtle tricks up his sleeve. This is by no means a perfect cd - but my rage at the other review has pushed it from a 4 to a 5. It is a fun listen!"
positive,"Classic Film Noir: Film Noir flourished in the forties and early fifties. Bogart's Maltese Falcon supposedly is the first film with a destructive hard guy and scarlet woman pairing. Love rarely works out and you're more likely to get bumped off than score the perfect heist. The cinematography is black and white with plenty of fog or dark shadows. There's an underlying dread, a cynical Chesterfield cigarette on the lip of coming doom.Detour is classic Film Noir. It's a B flick that is at first glance primitive, maybe shot in ten days. Tom Neal is in Ann Savage's web after he accidentally kills a man. It is so simple yet so intriguing. Ann Savage is forgotten, but not by me. She is the greatest evil woman ever in film. Rent this one immediately."
positive,"LiL' Boy Book: I think this book is cute & very useful. Other than the fact that the cover of the book was a lil torn, it is a good item."
positive,"The Grass Is Greener: One of the best detoxification actions you can do for yourself is drinking fresh wheat grass juice. It's been called ""liquid sunshine"". And growing and juicing for yourself is so much easier and cost effective than going to the juice bar. Yes, it is easy.Grow your own ""liquid sunshine"" and feel really alive again!This product arrived with in just a few days - much more quickly than expected!:o)"
positive,"Timeless: I recall the flurry of TV and print documentaries that appeared in 1984, all striving to answer the question ""How close are we?"" I thought that generally they missed the point.Yes, Orwell's classic was ostensibly about Totalitarianism, but on a deeper level, it is all about control. 'He who controls the past, controls the present' is Orwell's brilliant insight. And, as such, his thesis is applicable to an astonishlingly wide variety of modern situations.How do ... religious leaders get their followers to blindly accept everything they say? Simple application of doublethink, though policing and control of information. How do modern conglomerates get away with collecting and selling your personal information? Tell you that its all for your own protection, that's how.1984 is a brilliant, timeless book. It explores the strange quirks of human psychology that make it inevitable that we will always be controlled. And, to this day, it still sounds a prescient warning."
positive,"Better than the show!: I'm a big fan of Rugrats the TV show, and I knew this book would be much better then any of the episodes. I was right! It's extremely funny, and it's full of adventure. The only bad thing about this book is that some parts are really confusing, but you can easily get back on track."
negative,"Low db cable signal booster: The RCA 10db cable signal booster didn't have the strengh to maximize my cable TV picture quality. 10db is low but the big problem was it doesn't have a return path. This is needed so the cable company can talk to your digital box, but w/out return path the digital box is unable to talk back, (send information back to cable company). Did order 18db cable signal booster with return path, thank you."
negative,"The good, the bad, and the ugly: The good is the hardware. Neat, tidy, easy to hook up. The bad is the software, which is unreliable at best (not sure whether it's kludgy, or just doesn't work well -- tried with flavours of Windows from 95 through 2000 and XP pro.The ugly is support: it has to be the worst I have ever run into on the 'net, and that's saying an awful lot..."
positive,"Only Ella Could Pull This Off!: Only the Queen could *butcher* ""Mack the Knife"" the way Ella does on this album, apologize for it and end up winning a Grammy for her efforts. It's a delightful album, not just because of the ""Mack"" track, but because it's a chance to hear her give some of her old standards a thorough workout.Buy it & enjoy it!"
positive,Good Boots: Comfotable fit on the loose side. I use a heavier sock and works just fine. Recommended and would buy again.
positive,"A good game to buy.: I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the ""frustration factor"", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a ""5"" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the ""easy"" and ""medium"" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd."
positive,"Great Working, Not tasting....: I have been drinking this product for over a year on and off. I really enjoy the benefits to drinking it. The time i haven't been drinking it is just the times when i run out and don't get more for a while. The taste is awful, probably one of the worst things i have ever had to drink. There is no sweetness in this product, although, I have gotten used to slamming it down. This is an awesome product for those of us who do not eat enough veggies. It taste AWFUL, but works AWESOME!! I have no intentions of stopping the use of this product due to the flavor and I would recommend it to anyone!"
negative,"Disappointed: I like jazz, big band, classical and pop. Even throw in a couple country western, but I don't like this CD. I like something up beat and happy, not talking trash. Some of the sounds are cool, but not the lyrics."
positive,"Holiday: As leading man, Grant was unequalled, the epitome of charm, and Cukor's ""Holiday"" finds him in peak form, starring opposite the redoubtable Hepburn in this giddily amusing romantic comedy. Based on Philip Barry's Broadway play, this was the third Grant-Hepburn pairing in as many years, and one of the sauciest, as the young would-be lovers buck the dictates of high society. With excellent supporting work by Lew Ayres as Hepburn's alcoholic brother, and Edward Everett Horton as Grant's bosom friend, ""Holiday"" is an antic riff on lives of privilege."
positive,"another addition to my doomsday collection: the movie was all right, wouldn't pay anymore than i did for it, overall it was entertaing, for simple minds"
positive,Works well: Worked well on itch. Its certainly no miracle cure. Like other reviews say you have to use it everyday. I will probably buy this again.
negative,still waiting: I ordered this movie over a month and a half ago and have still yet to receive it. I would not order from this company the_music_shop_au unless you have a lot of patience. I just hope my movie comes in eventually.
negative,"nothing there: this is something I pop in when I want to zone outthe only good thing about it is that it has christpoher lambert, and he is hot. that's it.no talent was required to make this movie. even christopher lambert could have been better."
negative,"Faulty Power Cord: I bought this plug as a substitute to replace the Apple one that blew out. Unfortunately, this plug seems to have problems. I noticed that it heats up really badly when plugged into some plug outlets and causes my laptop to heat up as well. Once, I also heard some noise coming from my iBook G4 that wasn't there before. This noise went away when I unplugged the power cord. What I'm most upset about though is that it seems to have shortened the battery life of my computer to about 50% now! I think I should have bought the Apple plug instead."
positive,"Jude the Obscure: Jude the Obscure is an interesting book, but it is, like most classics, depressing. That is one of the things that makes Jude the Obscure so rich. If it had been a happy love romance it wouldn't be considered a classic. It instead challenges the readers to question the them which is on marriage. Hardy attacks marriage from every angle making the reader feel that there is no hope.Jude the Obscure has a rich plot that pulls you into the story. You feel for the characters in the book. You want Jude to be able to obtain his goals. You feel frustrated when he once again gets sidetracked from his goal because of his one weakness-women. If you like the classics, especially tragedies, than you will appreciate Jude the Obscure. It is good literature, has great symbolism, and the ending scenes will leave a poignant impression that won't be easily forgotten."
negative,"I SADLY MUST SAY THAT THIS IS BORING....: I'm a huge fan of Kai Hansen. I also like very much some recent works by German powermetal bands ( ""EXCALIBUR"" by Grave Digger and ""NIGHTFALL ON MIDDLE EARTH"" by BLind Guardian, for example ). But Kai Hansen appearance in IRON SAVIOR is almos as guest, since Pit Sielck writes all the songs, sings, plays guitar, bass and keyboards !!! The result is an album in which you clearly see the musicians skills, but where every song sounds the same: a furious metal assault with melodic choruses in between. After the first listening, the CD will be stuck into you collection pile for a long time ..."
positive,Great: Very good product. Just a advertised. Was worth every little penny I spent! Very happy with this purchase! Awesome! Pleased!
negative,"Poor Quality: There are many options for purchasing The Hobbit, and this edition is one to avoid. Cheap paper and binding. This was purchased as a gift - and I was sorry."
negative,"Beware!! There is a serious design flaw with this model: My Keurig Platinum worked perfectly for one blissful week. Then the machine began to turn off after finishing the brewing cycle. It's necessary to pick up the water tank and drop it back into place several times until the water begins to draw down. Once you can get it to brew, the coffee is excellent, however it's a big annoyance to have to finagle the tank after nearly every cup. Keurig should't continue to sell this product when they know that it has this flaw, and I will not be purchasing any other products from this company."
positive,"A Must-Read for Fine Arts Educators!: Jenson has updated much information in this quickly-read book. Anyone unfamiliar with his works will find this helpful; veterans of the topic will find new, useful ""ammunition."" Especially refreshing is the unbiased approach to the Mozart effect studies; a convincing view to show administrators because of its balanced presentation."
negative,"Ultra-overrated: I picked up this book with such high expectations-Ray Bradbury is relavtively famous, the book is fantastically reknowned, and it is about censorship, an issue that I really care about.Well. My expectations were smothered, stabbed repeatedly, and left on the floor to die. This is not a good book. Bradbury's writing is incredibly confusing, and some pivotal parts of the story are so removed from the main plot that you can't understand them.Bradbury has a penchant for killing off characters. For example, one character, that changes the life of the main character, is dead 20 pages into the book. If she was burned 'cause she had books, fine, but she got run over by a car. How stupid is that?Pass this one up, and for a real futuristic utopia, try 1984. Just not this."
positive,"A brightly burning insight just as important today: This masterful work of future prevention as Bradbury furvently declares it speaks volumes about the ease in which even a society such as our own (especially a society such as our own) can censor the voices of freedom that speak through books. Even though some of the material and references employed are a bit dated, as I said before, this was not intended as a prediction, only a warning. Are we wise enough to heed its message?"
positive,Just as I expected: The book came in a timely fashion and was in great condition. It was for my son for Christmas and he was very pleased with it.
negative,Don't know what all the good reviews are about: This book was required for my university-level elementary japanese class. I really disliked it. I found it extremely unclear. The explanations for grammar were minimal and not nearly as extensive as they should have been for an english speaker trying to learn a language as unfamiliar as japanese. The book isn't engaging at all and actually made me lose my excitement for the language. It makes Japanese more of a struggle than it actually is. Don't but it if you don't have to.
positive,"GREAT UPGRADE: Best addition to my acoustic Tak.Only one other review mentioned the 25/64 holes needed. I would only be echoing everything else he wrote so, I'll just say:Looks better, sounds better, & it's even weighted better.Any brand of anything can say they are the best in the world. In this case, it would be true."
positive,"Sobering: First of all, if you're not a Christian, you can respect this book for the verified research presented.If you are a Christian, I think this book not only illuminates the nearness of Christ's return, but in doing so, brings your own spiritual life under the blade of the Holy Spirit and if there are things that need to be delt with, after reading this book it will be hard to let them go.A must read for anyone serious about end times prophecy (which is NOW times prophecy) Jesus is coming soon. Yes they have been saying that for a long time, but when you read this book, you'll see that we are VERY VERY close to the actual event happening."
negative,"This is exceedingly lame: Look! Another band blatantly mimicking At the Drive-In. Someone needs to tell these tools that if they're going to cop another bands style, they ought to at least make sure that the band is still relevant."
positive,"Great Classic! And It's over 160 Years Old!: Some fine reviews here, but my main point is how relevent this amazing book is even after 16-plus years! It's so well-written and current (up to the 1840's anyway), you could almost think it was written today! The tulip hysteria in 1640's Holland is so famous some recent novels have been written about it! But the 2 best parts are the Crusades, and the Witchhunting sections, both religious-based mass hysteria. In the author's introduction ,he states that religious hysteria and delusions are so numerous he can barely scratch the surface! And think what's happened since 1842! The book is a bit dense at times, but you'll be amazed at the mass delusions described, sometimes resulting in mass slaughter, notably in the ""Crusades"" chapter. But this book should be familiar to every educated person, and will always be a classic!"
negative,"Some theory, Some technique.: Why am I not surprised that there is much debate amongst researchers on how best to teach English pronunciation? And why so much argument about the best way to produce native-like speech when the author practically concedes that it is nearly impossible? I can't use this overlong overpriced book in my ESL class unless I threaten to hit students over the head with it when they use 'r' instead of 'l'.I changed my review because the book has some teaching techniques. But here are still many flaws. It has a modified phonetic system which doesn't make sense, and it places too much emphasis on minor pronunciation details. There are better texts out there."
positive,Liked very much.: This is my second version of this opera. I like both versions. Amahl was very good in this version. ok
positive,"Really well done: This is a must read if you want to understand the American Revolution. The author does a fantastic job of explaining why the revolution happened. I had no clue that two generations earlier, the American colonists in MA were more free. With that knowledge, the revolution makes much more sense. Also, the idea that the revolution was not Americans vs. Brits, but a war of ideas I had never heard.The author clearly states why Washington was so needed. And the plotting against him.The author also gives a great list of books to try.Picked up for free - 2,694 locations so not long at all. Definitely grab if interested in history at all."
positive,"Great story: The only thing I didn't like about this book is that there are so many characters. I can't remember all my co-workers' names, so I had a hard time tracking everyone. But you've got to consider that the book covers almost an entire lifetime of one human being. We all know more people than we realize.Overall, it was a good read. The rollercoaster of sadness and happiness is a great illustration of what life is really like."
negative,"Don't believe the hype: I WISH I had read the previous review for this book before I bought it. I couldn't put it better myself. I bought this book because it was the only one advertising saturated fat counts. I already have two books that cover everything but saturated fat, and I'm going to keep it that way. I'm returning this book for a refund."
negative,"Ester: I love these converses, the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38, however I got a massive size 40 (7) and they don't fit. Also I now live in London and can't return them. sad times :("
positive,Amazing!: LJ smith is a fantastic author who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance. Daughters of Darkness has a special quality about it which induces feeling of love and adventure all at the same time. I would not be surprised if people respond well to this novel!
negative,"Ordered 2, both failed the first day: Found the product not to be durable. Both balls split in the first day of use so they seem too fragile for the intended use."
negative,"Just say no: These guys are a ska band, not a swing band. It shows. You listen to their horn arrangements, and they sound like bad rips offs of the 30s style. Listen to how they try to swing - it sounds mechanical, forced. How on earth can one listen to this and enjoy it? How can one dance to this? It just doesn't work.Maybe their ska is okay, but their swing is sickening"
positive,"This is the best album of the year: I recomend this album to anybody. Usually this type of hip-hop isn't my fav. but after hearing this album, I totally changed my mind. She is the best artist of the late 90's, and everyone should own AT LEAST one copy of this C.D. The lyrics flow through the songs, and they seem to be perfectly written. Please buy this album, you will thank yourself."
positive,a wonderful epic: This is one long story that really takes you into the depth of prehistoric times and rituals. It's wonderfully researched and finely detailed. I read with wonder all the recipes for medicine. What herb cured or maintained certain diseases. The movie does this book absolutely no justice. What was Darrel Hannah thinking when she signed up for that bomb? This book takes a look at human relations and the beginnings of communication. A great read.
positive,"Well done: I do enjoy Tolkien 's writing style. A very whimsical, almost grandfather's tone that manages to entice and entertain. Well done. :)"
negative,"A fair-to-good Christie novel...: ""Appointment with Death"" is full of shocks as Agatha Christie's books usually are, but is nowhere near as interesting as ""Death On The Nile"" or even ""Evil Under The Sun"". For ""Appointment with Death"", I would recommend renting the video (starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot, featuring Lauren Bacall & Sir John Gielgud, Director: Michael Winner 1988) which, strangely, has more shocks than the book! Not at all bad, but not to be read before the thrills of the Nile river and the Orient Express trip."
positive,"Innovative: Finally, an instrumental cd that allows dj's to mix withouthaving to buy the single to every popular hip hop song just toget the instrumental. Hopefully more will come."
positive,"A Smart and Sensitive Look at Power and Oppression: On the surface, this book offers startlingly beautiful language and heart-stopping imagery. But its offerings merely begin there. Levine, a master of metaphor and tone, uses these 18 surreal parables to critique power dynamics and to expose the oppressive mechanisms of family, relationships, body and gender. Often simultaneously funny and disturbing, these stories will resonate years after a first reading. Her expert use of the surreal is often called Kafka-esque, an overused and misused literary cliche that, for once, fits the bill. Her keen grasp and expression of humanity's politics precisely suits the Kafka legacy. Her expert use of language and imagery remind us that writing really is an art."
positive,"stupendously good!: I've had mine for almost a year now, still can't believe how great they sound. There are days when I will just sit and soak in the music through these things with a big goofy grin on my face...The non-noise-cancelling Sennheisers are slightly better but I bought these because I spend a lot of time on the elevated train here in Chicago and it gets pretty noisy sometimes. Sure beats the heck out of the Bose phones which cost an extra hundred bucks!"
negative,Quality is not there. You get what you pay off: It's not very soft......but got a great deal so I'm keeping it....sorry this is not much of a review... I can't rave about it..but at the same time I don't hate it. The frech blue color is very pretty...but the quality of the towels are that great for me to love!
positive,"Perfect Fit!!: This sunshade is a perfect fit for our Rav4, the price was good and we received it quickly. Highly recommended."
negative,"No Footnotes?!: I was very disappointed to find the footnotes missing from this edition. If there's a way to get to them, I couldn't find it & Pratchett's footnotes are a significant part of the humor. So buy the print version of the Discworld books - and do buy them. Prachett is always entertaining!"
positive,HAPPY: the discs all worked well and the case was in good shape. the retailer was very helpful in shipping it to me.
negative,"Waited too long for too little: I'd eagerly awaited this ""new"" book in the series, however, I could have saved my money, and re-read what I already have in my collection. I really expected more than a rehash of events, we don't need to spend an entire tome reliving the same old prejudices Ayla had gone through before. I had anticipated a final chapter, with Ayla meeting Durc and her Clan at some point, and living up to a dream she had about Durc and a new child she had meeting on perhaps dangerous ground. Or maybe I just dreamt this plot. At any rate, since MS Auel is writing another book, I sincerely hope she can get down to a continuation of the story and not simply a rehash of prior books with one new event!!"
negative,"Could it be more ponderous?: I expected to like this novel; Sontag has a wonderful reputation and the storyline had potential. Instead, it became the ONLY book I have ever found so simply awful that I couldn't finish it. The style had an obnoxious quality and the main character was annoying, self-absorbed and tedious. Astoundingly irritating!"
negative,"Pointless: Wow, how would you like to own a DVD of 4 Simpsons Xmas episodes? Even though half of said episodes are utterly NON-Xmas. Even the title of this DVD is wrong as the first was called Christmas with the Simpsons.Included on this DVD is Homer vs. Dignity, Skinner's Sense of Snow, Dude Where's My Ranch? and 'Tis the 15th Season. None of these are from the old seasons, so they are all new to DVD. But their not from the best years either. They're the cynical, classless episodes from recent seasons.Yes, they are funny. But the laughs are incredibly cheap and their targets too easy to hit. For the price, it's hard to argue NOT getting for a single watch on Xmas eve (despite the fact only 2 episodes are about Xmas), but for misers I'd wait for the full complete box sets of these later seasons. Crap as they may be.The DVD presents all shows in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with Dolby 2.0 surround. One brief extra, an animatic, is included."
positive,"Soul-mates: I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!"
negative,"IS OK...I GUESS: THIS MOVIE WAS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND, THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY IT, AND IN A WAY I DID, I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SEE IT NOT BUY IT.THE SCENERY WAS AMAZING, THE STORY WAS A BIT DOWN. SAW IT ONCE DONT CARE TO SEE IT AGAIN. MY OPINION OF COURSE."
positive,"A classic!: There has never been another Hollywood debut quite like Barbra Streisand's in FUNNY GIRL, and there probably never will be. Everyone knew she could sing beautifully, but this film proved that she was an actress, and a great one! Streisand proves that she is a true star, she is hilarious in the film's uproarious opening and she's absolutely heart-breaking in the dramitic end. She picked up a well-deserved Oscar for her work here.The rest of the cast is also good (Omar Sharif is especially suave in the role of Nicky Arnstein), the production values are high, the music is great, the direction is lively, and the story is touching.But above all else, it is Streisand's versatile and extremely likeable performance that holds the whole film together. Watch to laugh, watch to cry, watch to be entertained. A classic."
positive,Excellent Baby Float: Our extremely active son is 15 months and 22 pounds. He did very well in this float and seemed to enjoy himself. We put a couple of toys in front of him in the mesh part so he had something to play with. What I like about this float is that he sits deep in the water and not high up like some of the other inflatables.
positive,All Time Favorite Movie: This is a must see movie not just for anyone living in the New York area but anyone. It truly depicts life in the 60's living in The Bronx. Robert De Niro portrays his role well but his debut directing skills truly shine with this movie.
positive,"MAXIMUS! MAXIMUS! shout the crowd: ""Husband to a murdered wife, father to a murdered son and I will have my revenge"" So take that bad guy!This was the message delivered by Maximus to the Emperor during the 150 day Gladitorial Games. It is this bit of dialogue from the film that has been going over and over in my mind ever since. On the whole it's not an emotional film, which I found quite surprising, but if you like action and you're a lover of history (without casting too much of a critical eye on the accuracy of the history), then you'll love it! The special effects are brilliant and the storyline is good for what could potentially be a very boring film in the hands of the wrong director.The only complaint I had having seen the DVD, was that they left out a couple of really good scenes, which would have completed the film quite nicely."
negative,"Didnt work: Bought it to use with PS3 but it didnt work (you could hear no audio when plugged in). It only cost a few dollars so I didnt bother me that much, but it was part of a gift for someone else so I did feel bad that I bought it in the first place."
positive,"It's Early, But Very Happy With This Printer: I've had the printer only a short time and haven't pushed it too hard, but it sure beats the ink jets I've previously owned. Set up was easy, it's quiet, fast and the output looks good."
negative,Paper cutter?: My sister bought one for her kids. My first impression was that it was a tattoo gun. After arguing with my sister for a minute whether it could make a tattoo or not I tried it. I now have a permanent smiley face on my wrist. It is in fact a tattoo gun.
positive,"Product delivered on time.: Theres not much you can say about balaclavas, however it's labeled as ONE SIZE, if you're a larger man it will initially be tight on your face but will form over time. Again for the price and such a simple product I would say it's a very good product. The product was delivered on time and reasonably packaged."
negative,Warning: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME: Please do yourself a favor and exit this page right now. This game is the worst game on gameboy. There is no point to this game beyond the simple arcade bit. ...
negative,terrible: why are we forced to read this GARBAGE in high school? this book was terrible. i really felt like jumping in the book and slappin' that guy around a bit. how could he just act like that? UGH!
positive,"Great Photos: This printer will do everything that you would want from a low cost high output machine. The HP 1000 is the best in the photo series and I would recomend this printer to all my friends.Try it, you will like it, like all HP products."
negative,"OH, IT DESERVES MINUS 3 STARS!: ROBERT CLOUSE: THE SAME MAN WHO MADE THE GREATEST MARTIAL ARTS FILMS EVER MADE, ""ENTER THE DRAGON"" DIRECTS 1 OF THE WORST MARTIAL ARTS FILMS EVER MADE, ""GYMKATA"". KURT THOMAS. CAN'T ACT, CAN'T FIGHT, 'NUFF SAID."
negative,"The Worst!: A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book."
positive,"amazing: If I had to choose one book from the whole world of literature to call my dearest favorite, this would be it. There is no book more filled with the frank goodness of human nature and the possibilities of joy. This book has been a Christmas tradition in my family for years. Charles Dickens not only presents an entertaining story, but a philosophy of joy and goodwill."
positive,I'm feeling supersonic!: This is one of the best albums of the decade! Every song is ear shattering and every song will take hold of you!
positive,"Different than John Carter, but I still liked it.: After watching and enjoying the movie John Carter, I saw that it was based on A Princess of Mars.The book and the movie have a lot of character similarities, but the story is quite different.I must say that I enjoyed each and would recommend the book to anyone who is a reader and enjoyed the movie."
negative,"The ad didn't say what size this thing was: I ordered this wrench assuming it would fit my water heater drain plug. Since there was no choice of size, I assumed one size fits all. Well, unfortunately, one size does not fit all and this drain plug is too small for my drain plug."
negative,"From a Woman's Perspective: You wouldn't think so from the title and the expected action and fight scenes, but this is a beautiful epic. The love story behind it is lovely but bittersweet. Ridley Scott makes the characters come to life and he makes ancient Rome come to life. Now, I am a teenage girl. I went to see Gladiator with my friend for two reasons: 1) extra credit in Latin IV, 2) Russell Crowe. By the end of the movie, I had forgotten the extra credit, but I hadn't forgotten Russell Crowe. He is marvelous. I was wary of the fighting, I didn't want to see all the gore. Okay, there is some gore, but nothing I couldn't handle. The first battle scene is amazing. When the Barbarians are heard rallying in the woods, it sent chills down my spine, it still does when I watch it on DVD. So, for the boys: you'll love it for the fight scenes. For the ladies: Russell Crowe, he needs no further explanation."
negative,NOT WATERPROOF BROKE IN ONE USE: This is TERRIBLE. I have had this for 3 hours and it is already broken. It is absolutely NOT waterproof. Do NOT waste your money.
negative,"Too few examples: There are too few examples in this book. And the examples that are present are for the easiest problems only. Each section's problems are divied up into A (easiest), B (harder), and C (hardest). That's fine, but they give examples and explanations for A-level problems only."
positive,"Inexpensive Electronic Caliper is a good buy: The caliper is very good quality, measures inside and outside dimensions extremely accurately. I build and modify radio controlled aircraft and electronics and use this on every project. The price was also very good. Vendor and shipping were also great. I'm very happy."
positive,"Big, Fat, Stupid, FUN! (The cameo's alone are worth it.): First of all, if you are considering the widescreen version of this film...don't. Second, this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I can't stop watching it. When it came out in theatres, I thought ""A movie about Dodgeball? How stupid is that?"" I was very wrong.If you like Ben Stiller (which I do) I don't have to say anything. He is extremely funny and plays his role perfectly.To me; however, Vince Vaughn steals the show. I don't know exactly what it is, but I could swear that he ad-libs half of his lines. The character is almost ""too real"".The supporting cast (especially the lovely Christine Taylor) is absolutely perfect. I am not going to babble on about how great the movie is because a long review is boring. I will simply say that when I watch this movie, I feel like I am ""in it."" By the way...the cameo appearances are priceless. Ben Stiller seems to be able to talk anyone into doing anything."
negative,"keurig B70: Don't buy to expensive, first one only lasted about 13 months. Because we had a lot of K-cups bought another it lasted 2 weeks took it back to Kohl's department store and they replaced it. The new one was not even used because the water tank did'not fit properly (the plastic hook would not hold the tank in place) returned it for another an hopefully it will last longer than the others. We only make no more than 3 cups a day."
positive,Ageless: This and Lord of the Rings have long been in my favorites of all time. Now to drop it on the Kindle gives me a chance to re-read portions almost any time I want.
positive,"Good date movie.: Silly and fun, but sweet...this is one of our favorite date night flicks. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are great together...the location is awesome...and the animals adorable. Not to mention Rob Schneider is his usual ridiculous self which offers some good laughs;)"
negative,"terrible: The only good song is Grillz, Nelly strait up bombed on the sweitsuit cds plain and simple. Nelly sells to female fans period. He needs to get some country grammar action again. Paul Wall, ALi and Gipp saved that song Grillz."
negative,"A Pastiche of Other's Work: Save your money on this one. From an average introduction, things went steadily downhill. If there was any original research in this book, it could not be found. Pictures were dated and can be found elsewhere in several other sources. All were all full body shots with little or no detail. Perhaps strangest was the Glossary of Church Terms, few if any were used in the body of the text. What that had to do with the main topic is still a mystery. About the only redeeming feature is it is an example of ""pastiche."""
negative,Don't like the songs. They do not compliment Clay's voice.: Sorry. This CD was a great disappointment. The songs are terrible. These songs are not meant for Clay's voice. He needs to sing better songs than whats on this Cd. Where's the power of Clay's voice. He needs to pick his songs carefully in the future. Very disappointed with this one.
positive,its a great pmp: it is one of the the best pmp's around . a great LCD and really good looks wit a 30GB capacity . well the price is a bit on the expensive side ........when compared to the archos AV420 which is at 306$ wit the capability of video recording facility . . . . .well i bought a creative and i dont regret it at all . . . . . excpt they could have put in the recording facility .it will be the best one around .
positive,WORKS VERY WELL: This gel collar holds heat much longer than other collars. It fits well and I can even sleep with it.
negative,"Less than Impressed: We purchased the acclaimed, top end NS-ZCC-10 Neuro fuzzy rice cooker. We expected perfect rice because after all it incorporates the latest software and heating technology. We are very disappointed. Rice is overcooked and clumpy. We've tried to troubleshoot (more water, less water etc), but you know, the bottom line is that this cooker does not deliver excellent rice. We got better results with our no-tech, aluminum $50 plug in rice cooker.Very disappointed. I do not recommend you spend your money on this product."
negative,"UNDELIVERY: I've already complained twice because I've bought this product on august 9th, 2010 and I've never received it. As I've never got a answer, I'm writting this comment. WhAT shoud I do? I'm waiting for so many months and no answer and no product"
negative,"One star is more than enough: The book April Morning was required reading for my eighth grade reading class. As I read this book I liked it less and less. I found the it to be boring and pointless. It uses language and content meant for a more adult audience, yet is written in a style a fourth grader should be able to read. Furthermore I did not think the author did a good job in writng it. He has no substantial plot or interesting dialouges. Because of the lack of creativity and talent Fast uses gore and foul language to attract his audience. A book read in school should be one that relate to the reader and is creativly styled and worded, rather than nothing more than a trashy novel."
negative,"Pale imitation of good tropical music.: Some good songs, except the worthless last track, excellent musicians and the great Jose Feliciano as guest vocalist/guitar player but the annoying voice? of the alleged best latin female singer make this cd unlistenable. If you want to hear the best female latin singer get a Lucecita Benitez cd."
negative,The Butcher's Wife: I brought this DVD from Amazon and could never watch it because it says it's incompatable with my DVD player....DVD was made in Mexico.
positive,"Who Doesn't?: This is a very adult book. Glad I read it late in life, I might have missed its beauty. Should be required reading."
positive,as expected but...: This is a good product as it helps me keep a better grip on the PDA. It would have been a lot better though if it fit a little more tightly.
positive,"A well-crafted story: The Hobbit is one of those stories that most people have read at one time or another in their lives. I am glad that I, too, have read this story - it is well-crafted and takes you to away to a place of fantasy and wonder. I cannot wait until my daughter is old enough for me to read it to her."
positive,"Great Book, Both Times: I had read this book when I was in Junior High, and always wanted to read it again as I had enjoyed it so much, and was curious to find out what I had missed due to my age at the time. I took advantage of the opportunity to download the book to my iPad and to read it while I was flying on vacation. I found it to be as riviting and exciting as it was when I was MUCH younger, and found that while there were some nuances I had missed the first time around, I had managed to commit to memory the most important parts of the book. I highly recommend this book to fans of Robert Heinlein, or anyone that likes suspense or mysteries set in the future!"
negative,"Bad Design, Limits Walking...: We bought this for our 1 year old. He loves the music but there are 2 design flaws that prevent it from being used more. First, when closed for a ride-one toy, his feet drag. There are little returns spouts for the balls, but the are not big enough to put his feet in for rolling. They also limit his ability to walk/pedal it. Second, when the seat is open, the wheels are not open far enough apart. Therefore each step forward is kicked directly into the wheels. This is cute, but if your kid has legs, you should keep shopping."
positive,"Very Good Effort: I like the work of Luc Besson very much. This is a very typical Besson movie. The background and costumes are very accurate, they make one feel as if the crew was there filming real events. Mila Jovovich is wonderful as the title charachter, she obviously got into playing the charachter. On the whole, it is a very entertaining movie."
positive,"Good for quick visual reference!: I love to use this book as a quick visual reference while working on shows. When helping a customer, or explaining something to an assistant at our shop, this book is the easiest way to do so. It is so great to have a book where I can flip to a certain date, and have pages full of pictures grouped together to show someone what exactly I am thinking of. We have to work at a fast pace, and this book saves me lots of valuable time."
positive,Unbelievably awesome: I like that the dwarves respect Bilbo now that he has helped them when they were in trouble. I also like how they get caught a lot.
negative,"Found it Irritating: Though the book had some good plot points, I found the overall tone offensive. Mr. Hogan is apparently an atheist or agnostic, and believes in evolution. In his book he consistently bashes religion, making anyone who is religious appear to be either a fanatic or inclined towards greed and other base emotions. None of the protagonists ever mentions God or His place in the universe.I also found his arguments for Chironian society riddled with flaws. The most glaring - that Chironians place no value on stable family relationships, have no sense of commitment to a spouse, and there is never any jealousy or contention among family members or society in general. Just because the original Chironians came from computer programs and were raised by robots does not eliminate human's genetic leaning toward violence and confrontation.I read another of Mr. Hogan's books recently and found the same anti-God bias. I will not be wasting my money on any more of his books."
positive,Great story to listen to while driving across country: I have always liked reading Eragon. I made a road trip a couple of weeks ago and listening to Eragon made the mile fly by its a great adventure book.
positive,conversation tools: I liked the book and definitely picked up on tools for working thru violated expectations. Everyone could take away and use something from this book. Well worth the $s spent.
positive,Great Review on the Performance of Blackness: I was assigned to read the introduction for class but was so captivated that I had to buy the book in its entirety. Moten is a scholar and a poet. This book will be a staple in my research repertoire.
negative,"Not Bat Chain Puller: The original Bat Chain Puller is due to be released by Zappa records on 13th Feb., remastered with 3 bonus tracks from the same line up. THIS IS NOT IT. Dust Sucker is a poor quality, badly mastered version, with 6 bonus tracks from different line ups. It appears that Dust Sucker is being re released on the same date as The Original Bat chain Puller is coming out, in the hope of getting some sales of the back of it in the confusion. Don't buy Dust Sucker, buy Original Bat Chain Puller on Zappa records. Not Currently available on Amazon but available on pre order at [...]"
positive,"Kits are fun and easy: actually, growing mushrooms is pretty dang easy.If you plan to leave on vacation, refrigerate the kit. The ""special conditions"" consist of keeping the kit in a warm place and misting it with water daily.Personally, I've gone from agar cultures to spawn to mushrooms on my first try- that's impressive. A kit is a guarantee of mushrooms- Fungi Perfecti offers returns if it doesn't work out for you."
positive,"The Best Review Ever Seen: Alejandro and Martin.After reading `Romeo and Juliet', we noticed the difficult vocabulary that Shakespeare used. It makes it difficult to follow the story because Shakespeare plays with words and even invented some expressions.We like a few characters like Mercutio, because of his sexual jokes and language. Another character that we enjoyed was The Nurse, because of her fun-loving personality. The dirty sexual humor was very unexpected and, very funny.We found strange that the prohibited love of Romeo and Juliet was not because one family was in a poor social position, but because the two families fight for their own power. We also liked its end, when Romeo and Juliet died. It's surprising because we all expect a happy end with Romeo and Juliet's marriage.In conclusion, we found the story very interesting and surprising."
negative,"MORE LIKE UNPRACTICAL MAGIC: I finished this book in about 3 days realizing that the only thing that was noteworthy was the fact I had lost 3 days in my life to which I could have been reading something that was worthy of my time rather than wasting my time on this book. I read the book and saw the movie at the same time. If Hoffman had written a book with the same heart as the movie, maybe then I would not be so harsh. Plus, did she even do any kind of research for this book? Being a Wiccian,I am very disappointed.This girl needs to learn a few things about magic and the occult before she writes a book on it!!!!"
positive,"An overlooked masterpiece!: This is an excellent album that finds k.d. Lang at her very best! k.d.'s dynamic voice is definitely the main attraction of this album, as she maximizes it to convey the intensity of songs that are introspective without sounding trite or syrupy. A bevy of musical instruments including the accordion, violin, vibraphone, steel guitar and mandolin compliment k.d. and enhance the quality of the songs without detracting from her beautiful voice. The standout single is ""Constant Craving"" but songs like ""The Mind of Love"", ""Miss Chatelaine"", ""Wash Me Clean"" and ""So It Shall Be"" add great depth and dimension to the album and are essential to its atmosphere. This is easily her best album that becomes more compelling with each subsequent listening. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
positive,"Durable. Somewhat comfortable.: Blue collar jobs require some comfort level. I have an average build and this pant fits me well in all sorts of positions. Whether squatting to pick up a heavy object or climbing across blocked off areas to get merchandise, this pant gives me ample room. If you have thicker thighs, that might be a problem. After 10+ washes, it's still rough. I don't mind though. I normally wear a 30 L and it should be fine but this one seems to ride up on the back of the shoe. It didn't shrink or anything after the washes but it just needs a tug to get it back down after going up stairs. Maybe I'll get the 31 L next time. The waist was fine. Big plus is that my sweat doesn't show through under the waist line for some reason. That's good because w/ my old pants, once the sweat dried, it would leave a white residue on my backside."
negative,"Horrible Horrible Movie: I can honesty say that this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. Maybe because i didn't really understand it, but i thought it was boring, didn't like the concept, the acting, directing, or anything else about this movie. I am not a hard person to please when it comes to movies, especially classics wise (like One Flew Over the Cookoos Nest), but this movie just didn't do it for me. I heard good things about this movie from friends, so i rented it and was VERY VERY disappointed, and i don't think i could even watch it again without pulling my hair out consistently until the finish."
negative,"A good movie - if you are a 12 year old with ADD.: I saw this movie with a group of friends - we rented it. We only watched about 3/4 of it too because it was so terrible: the acting is very poor, the special effects are over-used, the plot is full of holes and is not very credible, all in all - it's just a waste of time.I'm sure there are plenty of pre-teen guy out there who think this movie is [great] but anyone with the smallest amount of good taste would give this movie a thumbs down.Save your money, don't buy or rent this ..."
negative,all of you are fools...: This album would be great if Thursday was not the name of the band.... But it isOnly at this velocity delivers what made them great in full collapse!They have went from screamo to emo to lamoAlso the drums sound like they have no mics on them where is the tight production we saw in the last two albums???Are the penny pinching or just getting lazy?
positive,Happy mom: My 8 year old boy just loves his sword ( the black color and the design). The toy is plastic and very light and SAFE. My son has it for 3 weeks and it's still in good condition so far. Very pleased about the purchase.
negative,"Terrible, Terrible Movie!: I loved the previous and original 'Mummy' movies, but 'The Mummy Returns' is a complete insult to the audience. The overwhelming, annoying amount of special effects? (Do you remember the cheesy images of the Scorpion King at the end? What was he doing winking at the camera?) The plot that completely forgets that of the previous 'Mummy' movie? There are many actors in this movie with some great potential that spend the whole movie ""acting"" to the special effects? The only thing we are telling the Hollywood studios, by making this movie one of the highest-grossing of the year, is that we want computer special effects to take the place of real acting and story. If we quit wasting our money on terrible movies like this, Hollywood will realize that we are tired of stupid movies like this and start making real films again!I want two hours of my life back!"
positive,"BABYFACE - A Witness: BABYFACE by Jeanne McDermott is a witness to the healing power of love. It is a true story of how people of all ages grow to meet unexpected challenges. Although in this case the challenges arise from the birth of a child with a rare cranialfacial disorder, anyone with the experience of having children and creating a new family constellation will identify with many of the issues that face Jeanne McDermott and her family.There is nothing superficial about BABYFACE and it reveals no easy answers. Instead, the reader shares a truly three-dimensional experience where the word ""miracle"" regains its stark significance and a ""mystical vision"" expands our world.BABYFACE is a book for anyone with a family, at either end of the generational see-saw, and it will not leave you untouched."
negative,"Price of < $10 is good but the shirts are thin..: Though good workmanship, I was expecting a heavier material for this brand name."
negative,They just keep milking the old stuff: With 100s of unreleased tapes in the archives all Universal can do is re-hash old stuff again and againThe CDs are classic Allmans but why a box set ???
positive,Voices From Beyond the Grave!: Ever wonder how your life is going? Former residents of Spoon River are allowed the last word as they speak about their failures and triumphs from their final resting places. More than a few secrets are revealed as well.
negative,"Horrible formatting for the Kindle edition: The book itself is fine. However, the font style and formatting used by the Oxford press is really unattractive, and there is no way to change the font style. You can change the size of the font but not the actual font style itself. It is a very old style and looks like something from the 1800s. I'm sure this was fine for printed books in the 1800s, but it looks horrible on a Kindle 2 screen in the 2000s. Come on Oxford, when you convert your books to an e-reader format, you need to put some thought into how the work will be displayed on e-readers. When given a choice, I always use the Oxford edition of classics, but for this book I switched over to the Penguin edition just because of the way the work is displayed on the Kindle 2 screen. Horrible job Oxford!"
positive,"Indispensible Product for every shop.: This is a must have for anyone doing mechanical work where the water/air tight mating of metal surfaces is critical. It cures but does not harden, without having to be exposed to air [Anaerobic]. I use this on my Sea Doo propulsion system and to provide a flexible seal to other metal mating surfaces. Where you have a damaged gasket, this product will fill in the missing or damaged sections of the gasket and allow for a quick solution. Read the cautions carefully. All of these products have some element of health hazard if used improperly. Highly recommended."
positive,"Great, but not as good as TGN2: The mix is good, and I liked almost all the tracks, but there was just something misssing in the cd that only TGN2 had. There was more hard trance/goa in TGN2, and TGN3 is more regular trance, which is still really good. My favorite track on this cd is ""Madagascar"" by Art of Trance, it just has an awesome background beat. I'm a stern follower of the TGN series, and I think it's one of the better trance mix series out there. TGN3 is a great cd, and I recommend it to anyone who is a trance lover, or hasn't experienced trance yet. Better yet, get this and TGN2, and you'll really be trancin' it up! =)"
negative,"I, Boring: I've seen this movie three times, and still can't force myself to like it. Frankly, it's boring. Will Smith looks bored, so does Bridget Moynahan (Sylvia Calvin) and Chi McBride. The ""funny"" one-liners are boring, too. The only person smiling in this production seems to be the robot, Sonny. And he's mostly animated! The movie is saved to some extent by the dramatic finale, when the robots come alive and try to take over the world (what else?). But not by much. Even during the finale, Smith and Moynahan look bored and boring! ""I, Robot"" ends with a cliff-hanger, implying that another revolution is in the air, this time led by the nice guy Sonny. But since there's no sequel, we're ultimately left with nothing at all...Two stars."
negative,Sucralose!: This popcorn is sweetened with sucralose. Do a search to read about sucralose. I'm not eating this or feeding it to my family.
positive,"Magical Mystery- THE BEATLES: What can I say? It's the Beatles for goodness sake. Every song is worth the listen, even the introduction song. ""Fool on the Hill"" is malicious but has a nice rhythm. ""Flying"" is an unexpected instrumental. ""Your Mother Should Know"" encourages you to listen to old hits. ""I Am The Walrus"" is interesting. ""Hello Goodbye"" is catchy. ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" is great as well as ""Penny Lane"" and ""All You Need Is Love."" This album came out in 1967. It also has a film that went along with it. Half the songs have lead vocals by McCartney while another half was performed by Lennon. For 2 months this album was #1 on the US charts."
negative,"How does this thing worth: While our flashlight seems to work, I can't help but notice that it has a lithium button battery, which might explain its function. The ""Magnet"" is actually a piece of lead. So how does it really work? Shaking it definatly increases the brightness, but it seems it is assisting the magnet."
positive,great Jeans: I have been purchasing and wearing the Lee stretch jeans for over 20 years and any other jean just doesn't fit right or feel good.
negative,Rod - Please Retire: Rod -Stop...Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please...
negative,"While this is a wonderful tale and a memorable cartoon, this particular version of the product is horrible.: My review is more about the actual product, ""Movies on Parade, the Hobbit""This product looks like a bad VHS copy of a copy of a copy of a copy transferred to DVD... the colors are extremely muted, and barely anything can be seen in the darker scenes, such as Bilbo and Gollum and Mirkwood.If you can find another version I urge you to do so."
negative,"couldn't even finish it...: I was anxious to read this book, but a friend of mine (who is a die-hard Stephen King fan) said she didn't like it at all. I found it at a book sale for $1 so I figured I didn't have much to lose. I should have taken her word for it! I got up to about page 150 and I just had to put it away. The story just didn't seem to gel together and at the point I put it down a truly out-there thing had just happened in the story which I just couldn't buy into.I recently re-read Bag of Bones for the third time, also by Stephen King, and it was just light-years better than this book...don't waste your time with Dreamcatcher, read Bag of Bones instead!"
positive,"WOW!!!: Ok, I reviewed this back on Dec. 20th when I was 1/4 of the way through. Now that I'm done I'd like to say that this is the greatest story that I have ever or probably ever will read.I won't reveal much, but I will tell you that it is about an Egyptian physcian who is exiled and he writes his life story in which he describes his dealings with the Pharaohs and foreign kings, and there is lots of murder, adventure, sex, pondering, religion, politics, drama, humor. This book really is just about life in general, it makes you think. Give it a try!!"
negative,Huh?: This was the first book of the series that I've tried and this book did not catch my interest. Maybe I would have enjoyed it if I'd read some of the earlier ones but this book was very dull and had little action. I'll stick with Horatio Hornblower.
negative,"bottom of the barrel action movies: even bronson looks tired in this sad action movie! why they made this waste of time and money is beyond me. not even so bad it's good,just bad."
negative,"Insane and senseless: If you are a woman and wants to learn about self esteem, I suggest you start doing yoga, learn about yourself, your strenghts and weaknesses, your dreams and what makes you fulfilled besides a man. In no way, I mean IN NO WAY, read this book if you are looking for love, that is, real relationships with real people in the real world."
negative,"A Big Waste: This book is a big waste of money. Besides being very expensive, most of the book covers other subjects other than XML, with little relevance to XML. Although there is some useful information on using XML with Java, there is way too much information on the Microsoft implementation of XML, (when the book actually gets around to mentioning XML) and the standardized W3 version of XML seems to be included as an afterthought. The reviewers who gave this book such a high rating probably didn't read the book very well, or are hired by the publisher. A much better book is the Liz Castro Quickstart guide to XML (for a fourth of the price of the Deitel!), although it is centered around the W3's standard for XML, and doesn't mention Microsoft's implementation. Castro text, however, is more suited to learning from the ground up. The Deitel text is a disaster and I wish that I had just kept my money."
positive,teachers tool: As techers we should learn more by reading now a days and this is a good book that helps you and gives you ideas about how to elaborate your rubrics.

negative,"creepy, dark, blasphemous book: If you want to feel creepy, weird, dark and half-way insane, please read this book - it's perfect for that. I also thought it was blasphemous."
positive,Best toy EVER: 20Q is the best game EVER INVENTED! All my family members are amazed on how it gets it right 9/10 times!! EVERYONE WILL LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! :)
negative,"That's a-stupid: If you are fond of adults acting like children with little to no intelligence and even less self-awareness, or if you think the ham-fisted histrionics of Nicolas Cage qualify as acting, this movie is for you."
positive,"No issues: I've purchased about three of these HDMI cables and haven't had any issues at all. I use one for my Xbox360, DVR, extra, etc."
negative,"Don't Buy This Book! It will Scare the Wits Out of You!!!!!!: There are plenty of other great books on parenting twins & other multiples out there -- do yourself a favor & don't buy this one! First of all, it is very technical & difficult/unpleasant to read. Second, it has pictures of women after childbirth with like several feet of hanging extra skin -- not something I needed to see when I was emotional and pregnant with two. It also had the most negative, scary tone. It seemed to tell you all of the things that could go WRONG and very little of what could go right. Let me tell you, from a woman who has been there -- it can go beautifully & without incident -- & not everyone ends up with miles of extra skin on their stomachs. If you buy this book while pregnant, it will only serve to scare the wits out of you. Save yourself the stress and look elsewhere for good information!"
positive,"great story, well directed, fine acting: This movie is quite a gem. Not the usual American fare, very refreshing and well told story. I gave it five stars because I couldn't give it six!"
positive,"Timeless: This is truly a timeless book. Great for young or old. The illustrations are beautiful and at this price you won't be disappointed. My wife and I shared this book with our granddaughter and she would ask us over and over ""let's read Ratty and Mole"". We are so happy to be able to find this edition again and share it with our great-grandchildren."
positive,A Must-Have DVD!: Strong medicine is one of the best shows Lifetime has ever produced. It is the ultimate show being that it showcases womens talents in the medical field. It deals with issues ranging from rape to murder to abortion. This is one buy you won't regret!
negative,"Lacks imagination and very uninspiring: I'll try to be even handed about this album. On one hand I accept it is very pleasing to the ear and has sold millions of copies. But does that make it a good album?To many people I'm sure it does, but to me it doesn't. For, in essence, all Moby has done is taken samples of old blues tracks and placed a drumloop and some piano melodies underneath, there's nothing good about that. In fact it's very, very lazy.Now I do accept he has done it very well but that doesn't change my opinion. I'm not totally against sampling, but he does it on nearly every track with no use of innovation, then what's the point? At least DJ Shadow knows how to 'use' a sample.The way Moby has shamelessly sold the rights of every track on this album, bar one, to advertisers means also you have probably heard every track already, therefore you may not need to purchase this 'recycled' album.Well of course it's upto you, but I prefer the originals!"
negative,"rushed to watch, turned off twice: the film ""last days"" for me was a one watch wonder. i am unsure if it will ever make it off the shelf and back into the player..."
positive,"The Best Of The City Watch Books: In my opinion Men at Arms is the best of the Watch novels. It was a great sequel to Guards,Guards and I really looked forward to reading it at the time. I enjoyed the introduction of the new members in the Watch since it gave the book a bit more variety. The plot between Carrot and Angua was also intriguing at the time. Im a big fan of Terry in general but the Watch( Commander Vimes in particular ) hold a special place in my heart. Keep up the good work Terry, your doing a great job."
positive,"Clay: Clay strikes a bigger hype than any of the American Idols and debuts his first album which is just amazing! Clay is a talented, sweet young man with many ambitions for the future.His voice is so strong and will carry you track to track. My favorite song on this album is ""I survived you""My only complaint to this CD, is that many of the songs sound the same. However, clay did a good job vocally on the songs, and many people will enjoy this CD!"
positive,"shubham basu: The thoughts captured in this narration are eternal, they are not bound by space and time. The mind, when captured by the simple description of Camus, without delving into psychology and philosophy, gives a reader an adequate opportunity to build an opinion for himself. In short, this book is a spoon full of potion, which carries one to that corner of human mind, which perhaps one would never be able to experience even in imaginations, in his lifetime."
positive,"A frightening tale of an enslaved, socialist future: 1984 is frightening. 1984 is thought-provoking. 1984 is a literary masterpiece, warning society of a possible future that would more or less end meaning in life. There's little more I can say. Just read the book for yourself; it's what I call required reading."
negative,"My least favorite Enya: Not much new here. Enya's voice is as beautiful as ever but the songs sound pretty much the same as the ones on all of her earlier recordings. The title piece, ""Amarantine,"" I find to be annoying. If I listen to this track the refrain just plays over and over in my head afterwords and drives me nuts - because its just the one word Amarantine. Over and over and over and over..... AAAAAAAAARRRGGGGG! Now when I play this CD, in the interest of my sanity, I just skip over this track."
positive,"I was so much older then: This album is recognized as a folk rock classic. I don't know that I can add much to what has already been said about it. One thing I have not seen anybody mention before is that there is an additional unlisted bonus track at the very end of the album. It is an instrumental version of ""It Happens Each Day""."
negative,"help me!: ok...i have been looking everywhere to find the soundtrak to the movie ""fear"" with mark wahlberg and reese witherspoon, it is my favorite movie in the world!!! i cant find the soundtrack ANYWHERE!!! will someone please email me at PrinSas16@hotmail.com if they have any info. thanks so much buhbye"
negative,"Worst buy for sure: Very poor quality. Wires seems easily breakable and there are pointy edges on the earphones, which almost cut me when I tried them. Definitely would not trust this brand/manufacturer at all."
negative,You get what you pay for.: These may have been fine except that there was a large chip in the skew chisel. And besides nothing beats quality made tools these are not. they are for those whom lack the time or the know how to sharpen their chisels. Do it right the first time so that you dont have to do it a second.
negative,"Trading one bad habit for another: Crystal Phillips gained sooo much self-esteem she had a long term affair with my spouse, which led to years of tension in my family(didn't know why at the time)...WOW Crystal...I can think of a few titles for your next book. I even remember our chance meeting....it's a small world after all!"
negative,"Yawn!!!: I figured that the reason I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch this movie was just because I was tired. Tried to watch it again and the same thing happened.Special affects were good. The rest of the movie just stunk. Plot holes to drive a truck through. poor acting and some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard were enough to move this into my list of all time worst movies.Of course the inane premise should have been enough to warn me off. Let me sum it up. Egyptian High Priest is screwing around with the Pharoah's mistress. He does this out in the open where Pharoah can walk in. Pharoah comes in and with his bodygaurds right behind him. The kill him.What do they do to punish this high priest? They put a curse on him where if he is ever released, he will be the most powerful creature to ever walk the planet and end all life as we know it. Ummmm... Why not just torture him for a while and then kill him...."
negative,"All That I Am reminds me of one of those ""NOW"" compilation cds.: I was reading most of the five star reviews--each reviewer sounding like they barely discovered Santana three albums ago. Supernatural was good, but trust me, folks, you ain't heard nothing yet if you haven't heard the rest of his catalog. I grew up on Santana's music, all of it, not just his greatest hits, but everything: Santana, Abraxas, Santana III, Caravanserai, Welcome, Borboletta, Lotus, Marathon, Zebop, Blues For Salvador, Milagro, this, yes, all of this is what defines the Santana sound for me. Sorry to say, but All That I Am lacks the heart and the focus of the great albums I just mentioned. I miss that Santana. Forget record sales and cool colaborations, give me music."
negative,"Should have Stayed in Wraps: I was LOL throughout most of this flick and had no remorse about hitting the rewind a full 10 minutes before the finale. With predictable transparent characters and recycled story lines, this movie plays more like a spoof than an actual sci-fi thriller. Some good special effects seem woefully out of place when draped on a sophomoric story line, like icing on stale cake. The best thing about the video is 1)i didn't waste my money at the box office and 2) it's fair warning about the sequel."
positive,Beautiful story: I have watched this movie when i was a little girl. it is really sweet and magical. Hey im 23 now and i still watch it! It is really worth watching. the music is really pretty too!
positive,"Deserves A Second Read...Deep: I have often heard that in a translation, part of the story is lost. I could not help feeling this as I was reading this book. Although I feel as though I have missed a few things in Camus' message, the novel offers interesting (and sometimes bizarre) insights on certain subjects such as death, love, and religion. The grotesqueries in the book are often behind great thought, and because I read this in a day, a deeper analysis of the book might help in understanding some of Camus' intents. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick (but long lasting in thought) reading."
negative,"Becoming Jane is becomingly o.k.: I thought Becoming Jane was well acted,and the photography was very interesting.This is supposed to be the story of JaneAustin becoming a writer based on made upmaterial. I gave it 2 stars."
negative,"i got it cheap and it is Cheap !!!: I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . This is not a quality product , avoid at higher prices"
positive,"Explosively rich on contempory adolescent culture!: I think that this film is rich in the sense that the directors tell the audience straight up to where some aspects of where our society and culture is heading and that we shouldn't leave our children be in such a sensitive and under developed stage where they become ferral and raise themselves to accomodate for their own everyday lives. The last thing that fitzpatrick says that when your kid there is not much to do and when you find something that you like you shoot for it, which it was that he did which leaves him with such a bleak existence. This film is spectacular in that it is a message to us and that I think that however weird and odd it seems it is very clear."
positive,"No Kitschy Kitties Here: Even if you don't especially love cats, you will love this book. If you do love cats, you'll be crazy for it. Silvester's photographs are so beautifully composed, it's amazing -- angles, colors, lighting -- all are wonderful. In focusing on sleeping or yawning kitties, he captures the relaxed atmosphere of the Greek islands to perfection. The cats you will see here look like and behave like cats -- they aren't posed in that cute way you typically find in cat books and calendars. On the other hand, the photographs are not ""arty"" in a cold, inaccessible way either (thank goodness). I can't imagine that anyone would regret purchasing this book. It would also make a nice gift for a cat lover."
positive,Nice compilation: No pictures.Well put together.This book is the best compilation I've been able to find in the free section. All of the others contained rhymes I've never heard of. It also contains longer stories than your traditional compilations.
negative,"Riddled with errors - DO NOT BUY FROM GENERAL BOOKS: This book is completed destroyed by errors in printing. The text is unreadable at points; various spelling errors litter the book. The chapters are not separated, and even worse, are sometimes still in the same line as the sentence before it! Do not buy the black and tan cover, printed by General Books. I wish I had looked through the books closer before the return window expired."
positive,"finally! A book that's different.: I don't understand why everyone else who wrote a review didn't like this book. It's one of the weirdest yet greatest books I've read. It's up there in the pile with Jane Eyre! From my point of view, the majority of people who wrote a review where FORCED to read the book in school, and people don't like to be ordered around. I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness. Usually a book has a fierce female fighting the mean, crude, bad man. But this book was different, being a weak girl and innocent man, and being different is just like thinking differently, and that's good."
negative,"I thought this book had too much irony in it.: The Mayor of Casterbridge was a very interesting novel. In my opinion Hardy uses too much irony, and this kills the fun of the whole topic. It is true that every day is filled with irony, but it shouldn't be in somthing someone is reading. the novel also shouldn't be too predictable, I guess that's why Hardy likes irony. If you are a reader who likes suspense and tragedy then this book is for you."
positive,Civil Procedure: Great book for law student studying civil procedure. It provides great examples of real world civil procedure (rules of the court) issues with actual cases and notes! GREAT text for law students!
positive,Essential peice of equipment if you....: have kids or big dogs with wagging tails! Need I say more?I thought there might be some awkwardness when typing but this things fits better than a condom!Highly recommend!
negative,"A Turgid, Pretentious Anti-War Allegory: No wonder there is so little said about this award-winning Faulkner work. It is a chore to read. Only in a few passages does the reader have the sense that the writer can tell a good story. Worse than that, the characters are like Rorschak blots with the Christian mythology mixed in. Stick with Faulkner's southern writings for characters who remain in your memory and images that are profound."
positive,A BOOK EVERY JEW SHOULD READ: IN THIS BOOK THE LEADER OF WORLD JEWRY SETS DOWN THE GUIDELINES OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A JEW IN TODAYS WORLD. AS ALWAYS RABBI KAHANE WRITES NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH IN THIS BOOK. THE RABBIS WRITINGS ARE SIMILAR TO THE WRITINGS OF THE PROPHETS IN THE BIBLE. THIS BOOK WILL SURELY MAKE THE KAPOS IN THE US JEWISH AND ISRAELI ESTABLISHMENT CRINGE WITH EMBARRASSMENT. AFTER READING THIS BOOK THE READER WILL BE LEFT WITH A FEELING OF AWE FOR THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS A FEELING OF ANGER TOWARDS THOSE IN THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT AND THE MOSSAD THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR KAHANES MURDER. AM YISROEL CHAI!
negative,"Foundation [is not good]: ...It is awful, truly one of the worst books that I've ever read...Good writing does not not to be defended like this, and the need to defend a book in this way prety much proves that it is a substandard work."
positive,"Get's the reader moving!: Look- this book is about ideas, not formulas. I just made an appointment with a Fidelity advisor and I'm motivated.Fidelity is going to be my ""mother ship"" in 10 years and I'm driving 2 hours to meet with a field office. The author gave me the idea after his comical discussion on retirement. Also, he brings the humanity into the equation. Thank God somebody has the huevos to bring up the fine points of where we really want to be after slaving for an employer . Living in a planned community is fine for some, but would be purgatory for me and he ""gets it"". Thanks Lee- I'm going to pass this book on to one of my buddies."
negative,Watchtower is total crap!!: Avoid this toy at all cost. It falls apart when touched. The elevator stopped working almost immediately. Total rip off.
negative,"Ew: Cassie is so bad, she has to resort to stripping down to her panties in her video clip to get music sales. You all know that she has definately got no talent at all, and you only like her for her looks. She is just a ashanti, but with even less talent. hahaha. Her voice sounds like she was raised from the dead, because her voice sounds lazy and her song is quite boring. She has got no vocal talent."
negative,miss understood: I sent this as a gift and did not realize that the disc was blueray and the recipient could not play it o her machine. Had re-sell it and wil have to get another one. I have seen the movie many times and have always enjoyed it.
negative,"More than Thomas, Not Geared Toward Children As Much: I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten, which is a typical Thomas DVD. However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections."
positive,"Loved the characters and the setting: I read a lot of romantic suspense books, and this is one of the best I've read in a long time. The author describes the people and places so vividly that I felt like I was there. The descriptions of Ireland really set the book apart. The characters were so fully developed and the plot so tightly written that the outcome was exciting and completely believable.If you like books like ""Rebecca"" and Isabelle Holland's adult romantic suspense, you'll love this novel. It puts real emotion back into romance."
positive,"Another example of sheer brilliance, I must say.: Moby truly is a musical genius. I can't deny that he's terribly influencial to the rest of the techno/dance/electronica world. After listening to Honey and Run On, I wouldn't be surprised if we hear more music like this from other artists. Play is another fine album with music similar to that of his album Everything is Wrong, one of his absolute finest. And his social comments found in the insert are always a treat to read since I couldn't agree with them more. Props to you, Moby."
positive,True Prediction: On of the best and prophetic novels ever written about the descent into dehumanizing socialism.
negative,"Don't believe the hype: Aerials Forest and posibly Toxicity and Chop Suey Those are the good songs on the album. Prison Song is ok the first time you hear it but eventually it gets annoying and lets not even get into the atrotcity that are ""Jet Pilot"" ""Phsyco"" ""X"" and ""bounce"" To sum it up in one word Over hyped"
negative,No good if you have Windows 2000: This works fine with Windows ME(with a patch)and Win98 but I mostly use Win2K. Intel offers a beta driver for Win2K but it doesn't work very well. I would recommend buying a different camera if you use Windows 2000. I will have to buy another camera now that I use mostly Windows 2000.
positive,"A monologue on shortfalls of general-ship and the war of 1914-18: JFC Fuller has always been erudite and his reaction to the general-ship in World War I makes an excellent read.I however do wish that the digitisation had been better since each page needs a change of font size in this Kindle edition, when read on an I pad."
negative,"What a JOKE!: This book was given to me by a friend, and as I read it I became more and more curious why someone would even write a book with titles like: Marilyn: Money Mixed with SEX?This book is an unhappy compilation of people who are focused on money and the happiness it should be bringing them. They seem clueless that the lack of Jesus in their lives is the reason why they cannot get over their addictions to money.This is a very Catholic book about trying to make oneself feel better about having a large sum of money. The book examines such queer questions such as(page 218), ""What is the deepest calling you can hear about the sacred potential about money in your life"".This author needs to get a life."
positive,Anger Management Workbook: I use this to help myself of course but also teach others with. One the best I have ever used. It is really done well.
positive,"Charming surprise...: This is such a feel-good film. Diane lane does a wonderful job playing the woman who leaves behind everything and starts over new. The people she meets, the scenery, the neuroses are all charming in their own way. Where Eat, Pray, Love failed, this film succeeded. A woman sets out to find herself after a personal disappointment, but rather than the whiny arrogant character of Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love, Diane Lane's character has a relatable warmth and energy despite her situation. i highly recommend this film for a rainy day."
negative,"Mostly Siamese If You Please: If you have a Siamese cat, this might be interesting, but only one chapter applies to the title claim of ""how to talk to your cat,"" and I suspect Siamese must speak a different language than other cats. This was written in 1978 and sounds old-fashioned in the style of writing."
negative,Didn't work well for DTV signals: Wanted to split my DTV Antenna signal to go to another DTV in the house. Barely made any difference at all only allowing reception of a few of the stronger DTV channel signals on the second DTV and no difference on the orignally connected DTV.
negative,"Where was the editor?: Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy.Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues)."
positive,"rings true: The first time I saw Office Space, a few years ago, I thought it was not bad, but nothing all that special either. I must have watched it at least 10 times since then though, and each time I like it more. Now I'd describe it as a comic masterpiece. I love what they've done with the music, and many of the less visible characters, such as Lawrence the neighbor, are hilarious. I absolutely love all the characters in this movie, with the exception of the stapler guy, whose meek and mumbly humor I still haven't managed to appreciate yet. I think what makes this movie really extaordinary though is that it does such a great job of parodying the ridiculous aspects of the office environment. As outrageous as much of the material is, it really hits home with the millions who have suffered through similarly stupid situations at their own work. Not good for young kids due to some language, I'd recommend it to anyone else who is looking for a good laugh."
positive,"Fear is a wonderful and intense phsyco thriller!: Reese Witherspoon and Mark Wahlberg are great in this movie, very convincing. At first, you fall in love with David as he charms his way into Nicole's heart. Then, realizing that he's a lunatic (but a hot one), you wish that Nicole would just see through him and end it! Some of the scenes were a bit graphic, but overall, Fear is a wonderful movie."
positive,"very clever...: I totally enjoyed this Sedaris book than Me Talk Pretty One Day. I felt that as a writer he became more mature and addressed his humor and sarcasm at the right moment, drawing laugh out loud conclusions and hilarious observations. It is so clever to be able to acknowledge your mistakes and way of life and make fun of yourself and Sedaris does amazingly well!The book is a collection of stories from his childhood and his life as a writer. Each story has its own glow and message, reading along you wonder if his family is the reason behind this comedian or that he sees life from a different prospect!"
positive,"WOW! A spectacular book that you've GOTTA read..: This has got to be one of my fave books, as it has everything in it... I WANNA READ THE SEQUEL, ELDEST!!!!! That was supposed to come out this past summer, but now, I guess it's unknown. I'm sorry I won't be more helpful in the book, but even the smallest detail will give away a huge part, as each detail plays a role in the story.G2G. Make sure you read this book."
negative,"A joke that isn't funny anymore: The Shaggs' first album ""Philosophy Of The World"" is an oddity to be sure, and a bizarre, yet bizarrely fascinating piece of rock history. But anything beyond that, and that means this release belabors the point far beyond what is even remotely necessary. Skip it."
negative,"I didn't receive it yet.: I don't know the reason that I didn't receive it yet.Even I paid already.And there is no response at all.I ask the reason and what happened again.If you sent it, could you track my package?Thanks."
positive,A classic favorite.: Paul Galdone captures the story just right with his wording and illustrations. This is a must-have for my grandchildren. You can't go wrong with a Paul Galdone illustrated folktale.
positive,"Great non stick surface: I've had this pan for several months now, and I'm still happy with the non-stick surface for cooking as well as for easy cleaning."
negative,"Why is this a DVD?: Once again, the poor review does not reflect my feelings for the movie. ""Mortal Kombat"" is simply the best...scratch that...the ONLY good movie based on a video game. There's enough in it for fans and newcomers alike to enjoy. It's a big, silly ninja movie that doesn't take itself seriously, which is great.However, what's with the ... DVD? Trailors is what they offer us, nothing more? No commentaries, deleted scenes, or even ""making of""s?Well, forget it. Sod off, Mr. DVD Man. Buy the VHS copy, everyone, you'll get everything out of it you need. Refuse to support lazy DVDs!"
positive,"A thriller from begining to end: This was the first Clancy book I ever read. From the first time I picked it up to when I finished it, I could not put it down! It is a MUST read for ALL MILITARY FANS! Though the book is a little old and some of it might confuse people today (i.e. F-19, it is actually today's F-117) It is a magnificently written book."
positive,"glider: the glider got here much sooner than I thought, it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there. I put it together by myself even if the kept saying 2 people. It was not hard and directions were simple.. It's really nice"
negative,"a few good ideas spun out way too long: There are a few decent things here, for example the author's idea of your stock portfolio as inventory in your personal business, but there is too much pretense at telling the reader Wall Street ""secrets"", and not enough hard analysis. And even the inventory metaphor falls down: Good stock picks should increase in VALUE, not just in price. And if they do increase in value, and the price does not get too far ahead of the value, they should not be too quickly sold."
positive,"A great book: This reasonably short book summarizes the basics of personal finance in an easy to read witty style. It's aimed at the intelligent but beginning investor looking for practical advice and guidance on investing and money management. Although it does discuss buying options, day-trading, etc. readers looking for detailed comprehensive information and advice on these and similar topics probably should look elsewhere (or perhaps they should look here first-- after reading this book they might think twice about investing in more complicated schemes). For those looking for sound unbiased advice and information on basic investing and money management however this book will be very helpful. And as an added bonus, its actually fun and enjoyable to read."
negative,"rated 1 star because that's as low as I could go.: This book is a collection of absolutely subjective platitudes that serves nothing more then to lead impressionable (to put it lightly)...dare I say...hungry seekers of an explanation and reconciliation of their own mortality and the ever after.And for the obvious ""fan"" base. It's just a little more brick 'n mortar to fortify their own (________)...insert your own."
positive,"just like the picture: good product, just as it was shown on the internet. It was just what I was looking for and could not find in any local store."
negative,"Cute but not sturdy at all: This book shelf did not last long at my home, I had to replace it after about one year. It started rocking from side to side after a few months and the books started leaning forward and falling out. Would not recommend it for homes with children under 5 years old."
positive,"Good story: Good story. I admire the way the ending was handled. It could have ruined the entire film for me, but instead it was beautifully portrayed. I was awed by Crowe's character's fighting skills. I especially liked that last fight. I'm a big fan of action and horror flicks but I found the violence in this film to be especially graphic. Some may find that realism to be a plus. Parents might not want their younger kids to see this film. I must say that the costumes and the scenery in this film were a definite plus. They did a very good job of recreating the Colliseum. It all looked so real."
positive,A great classic!: This a wonderful classic that is worth watching during the holidays! A child and her grandfather develope a wonderful loving bond. A refreshing family movie!
negative,"Slightly dated: Two friends of mine ranted and raved how this movie was fantastic. Now, admittedly they weren't comparing it to the likes of ""Avengers"" or even ""Taken"", but they said I simply HAD to see it.I didn't see the hype. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of all three of the actors in it. I guess I just couldn't get behind the story. And cinematography wise it's got the feel of a made-for-TV movie, not an actual cinematic outing.Is it a MUST SEE flick...not really. Catch it if you've got some free time & don't have anything better to watch. But it's a long way from Liam's best work."
negative,"Kurt deserved more than nothing: One of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Actually I turned it off after about an hour...I don't know why I waited that long. Kurt was such an interesting and enigmatic person, a movie should have been made to pay respect to him or give something of a behind-the-scenes look at him. This movie basically shows Kurt as a wasted heroin addict with nothing more to offer or say or do; lazy film making, terrible camera work. Seriously if you rent this movie after reading this review you have no one to blame but yourself. Literally one of the worst movies ever wasted on film."
positive,"Great product: I purchased this for my truck - first class product, easy installation, great looks. It works to keep stuff off front of hood and deflects the occasional bug and rock."
negative,"Needle & Thread Not Included: I bought the Mega Playland for my seventeen-month old son this past Christmas. I bought it on sale for $40 after reading mixed reviews. Sure enough - upon opening I found that every piece had a couple of four-five inch spans of seam that weren't sewn. After spending an hour with my needle and thread (on Christmas morning) it was ready to go. My son likes it. Our 100 pound dog likes it too, and it seems to be holding up fine so far."
positive,"What else can I say? The definitive telling of the Manson murders.: ""Helter Skelter"" is the first and only book I have ever read regarding Charles Manson and his followers, and after having finished it, I can't imagine ever needing to read another. Bugliosi goes over the Tate/LaBianca crimes in minute detail, and even covers earlier murders committed by Manson and the family that most people might not know about. Even though the basic details of the story and the outcome of the trials are already known, Bugliosi's telling is enthralling and at times I had difficulty in putting the book down. Highly recommended."
negative,Total Waste of Money: Not one of the ear gels worked. Feel like I got ripped off. The ear gels are headed to the trash can where they belong.
positive,"good value, works like a charm!: This card installed without a hitch on my Dell Dimension with Windows XP Pro (Service Pack 2). It wasn't even necessary to install any drivers; Windows simply detected the new FireWire and USB devices and installed them without prompting.The device works great. I noticed a huge increase in transfer speeds coming off my USB 2.0 capable digital camera (my Dell came stocked with USB 1.1 only).I would definitely recommend this PCI card!"
negative,Close But No Cigar: This movie is actualy ok compared to the animated Lord Of The Rings but it would have helped if they would have followed the story a little more
negative,"Mindless and Senseless: I do not understand how anyone could have enjoyed this film. The acting was terrible, as was the story. It barely held my attention, and I also felt that it was demeaning to women, in that it portrayed women as stereotypical psycho's who will do anything to get married, and to get their hands on a man's money! Renee Zelwegger & Chris O'Donnell were both a waste this film. I wouldn't watch it again, and wished I'd have listened to others who told me not to see it ..."
positive,"upgrading my vhs to dvd.: got this as a joke gift on vhs almost ten years ago. it became a staple at parties with friends instantly. everyone loves it. wore the tape out, had to come here to get the dvd. five stars, easy. highly recommended."
negative,"Sticky yucky mess: Deodorant control works by gluing you pits shut. Seriously, this stuff was sticky and nasty."
negative,"paternalism w/o character development: The music was good. The people seemed real but skin-deep: booze, drugs, guns, stupidity, self-destructive violence and instant sex. There's no depth to any of the characters. The question remains how can you make a movie with Chess treating his artists like children financially (read"" PATERNALLY), but the movie doesn't make clear if he is scamming them or not. Muddy Waters doesn't seem to have a clue what money is his and how much and why. Chess buys him a car as if he's an empty-headed girlfriend, and as such gets paid with whatever Chess decides to give him. Etta James decides he ""loved her"" because he left her the deed (doesnt say mortgage is paid off) of a house that cost in 1970 (year Chess died) about $35,000. Chess sold his company for over $6,000,000, and that doesnt count the millions he made on the way up. In short, they had an opportunity to make a complex character, and instead make a superficial and (almost boring) one."
negative,"StarBrite Teak Oil drools and greates brown spots....: My husband applied two coats on our boats teak rails..looked nice until exposed to heavy dew. The water combines with the oil and drips on anything below it. This creates nasty brown spots. Now, only a month later, thank god, most of the oil has disappeared,and the rail is turning gray again. We will have to use polish and elbow grease to remove the brown residue."
negative,"Dated: I borrowed this video from the local library. The video could be used to teach beginners to classic cross-country ski provided there was an experienced instructor doing narration, otherwise you may put the class to sleep. The footage consists of long and repeated shots of a single skier traditional skiing, to soft almost hypnotic music in the background. The video is somewhat dated in its technique, equipment and filmmaking, and would be hard pressed to compete with modern videos the likes of Warren Miller (Alpine), Christian Begin (Mtn Biking) or xczone (cross-country skiing)."
negative,BioTutor is lame: BioTutor is the worst educational software I have ever purchased. I trusted the reviews that were posted and was a total fool for doing so. It is simply pretest questions with written explanations if you need them. I can't believe they consider this interactive. I could get this from doing the pretests in the back of my book. I will be sending this software back!
negative,"Would not recommend...Frequent Leaks!: I purchased Pampers Baby Dry size 4 thinking it was a good price for the Brand Name. However, only a couple hours after placing the diaper on my baby, it began to leak through the front panel. The diaper was hardly full, but my baby's clothes were damp. These diapers definitely don't make it through the night either. All the diapers in this box have been this way. Maybe my Pampers box was a just a lemon. Good luck."
positive,"Get this book: Get this book! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero, Hari Seldon, sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work, forces of humanity and all that, but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals. If you know this ahead of time, you will appreciate each story even more."
negative,"A low budget Movie: This was a low budget movie and it showed,The actors could have been a little more real when playing the parts. It looked as if some of the actors that this was there first time acting. The main leading lady office looked as if it was in a lunch and she was the one who owned her company?? didnt enjoy it at all a wast of money..."
negative,"What Are You Thinking?: What are all you people thinking? Anyone who rates this highly and/or takes an interest in this is basically a qwack. Save your cash, or if you're considering this put your head in the toilet for a better ""read"" about water."
positive,"It's a winner - my son hasn't put it down...: My son started reading this last night and made it about halfway through the book - he loved it so much, he just couldn't put it down! He was only into the book a couple of pages when I told him that we could watch a movie he'd been wanting to see (I didn't realize he had started the book). He opted for the book! He's already checked out the school book fair to see if they have the next one."
positive,"A short story....: A wonderful story but somewhat short. Take out the illustrations and the total story would be two or three pages long. But I love some of the old tales and I love cats, so this was a must for my library. The Puss In Boots reminds me of the tricksters of Native American tales. Enjoy!"
positive,Great earrings for the price: You can't beat these earrings for the price. They are also very light and delicate and look great with everything.
positive,"Great product: I am so happy with this product. My drawers stay neat, clean and most umpotantly organized - I can find everything quickly."
positive,"classic Golden Age mystery: Written in the style of the classic 1930s country house mysteries, this book is laugh-out-loud funny. It's full of intrigue, murder, blackmail, and robbery as almost every guest at the house party plot and counter-plot against each other. Inspector Wilkins, the local policeman who is not sanguine about his chances of catching the murderer, nevertheless untangles the intricate plot and takes his place alongside Hercule Poirot and Lord Peter Wimsey as a Golden Age detective."
negative,Not like I remember it: I bought this book 'cause I loved the movie when I was a kid. The book is really dry and a little hard to relate to. It's very English with lots of Moor descriptions.Couldn't finish it. Want it?
negative,"weak and not so good: I rented this on Unbox as the reviews were good and the trailer looked funny. Well, for me, I couldn't have been more disappointed. I like quirky and sacastic and dark humor. I like british humor. This was a movie I found flat. SPOILER!! The whole gay relationship with a midget and subsequent kidnapping thereof was cheap and crude. And not in a funny way either. Rent/buy at your own risk. I am surprised this movie has as many good reviews as it does. I guess I'm just getting too old?"
positive,"WOW Great movie!!: I could just say ""WOW"" and leave it at that! If you like scary movies, movies with lots of action, and movies that you finish watching and want to watch again just because IT WAS THAT GOOD......well, then buy this movie!! It has become one of my favorite movies of all time, and I've watched a lot of horror movies!!"
negative,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS FILM,SEE THE HOUSTON 1956 ONE!: Between lousy directing, and pointless wide camera angles, and a total disreagard to the book, (Unlike previous film and TV episodics) this was so bad, that I forced myself to sit through the entire video, just to see if it ever got better, or resembled the book in any way. I don't think anyone read the book on this production, or even bothered to read the cliff notes. A real waste of the actor's time, and ours."
negative,"You'd expect more humor from the creators of South Park: I was looking forward to seeing this film, when I did it was a disapointment. South Park is funny. You'd think these guys would be AS funny. No. This film was like Airplane or Naked Gun, but not funny. I wouldn't buy it or rent it."
positive,"a ""gotta have"" for every fan!: I got hooked on this series when it first aired, and renewed my interest when (a year ago or so) I saw one of the two movies on television (movies sold seperately). It also got me interested in puppeteering!"
negative,"Good Stuff!: This is really good cookware. It is heavy enough, heats evenly and is simply beautiful to look at. If you're considering an affordable set that really works, you won't be disappointed with Farberware."
positive,"Great show! Fun to watch!: I love love love this show! The characters are so well written play out great. Nothing clean about this humor though folks, so if you are looking for a show to watch with the family, try something else."
negative,"Barely warm: As usual Amazon service and delivery was superb. The product however, the Mr. Coffee cup warmer is barely that...that is it's barely warm. These are supposed to keep your coffee, tea, or other hot drink hot. Not scalding, but hot enough to enjoy as a hot drink. I'm sorry I made the purchase."
positive,Happy Reader: Hard to get into due to unfamiliar words. Adjusted as I read more. I did enjoy it very much. A book worth reading.
negative,"Conspiracy lunacy at its worst: Still's book reads like a litany of modern urban legends. The Illuminai, Atlantis, even pre-Columbian Native American Freemasons! If you want to read something worthwhile on prophecy and conspiracy, look at Gregory Camp's ""Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-times Paranoia"", or Richard Abanes' End-Time Visions. William Still shows a chilling willingness to us facist sources to ""prove"" his conspiracy theories. Authors like Nesta Webster (British facist in the 1920's), Abbe Barrel, and John Robison are used as credible sources. Truly scary right-wing ideology, just this side of Tim McVeigh."
positive,Clay is awesome!: I will keep this short....Buy this cd then go out and buy the single with Clays version of Solitaire. Both this cd and the single are unbelievable!Happy listening.
positive,"Solid pan; works as I would expect: This medium-sized pan is solid, and non-stick, as advertised.I have cooked bacon, eggs, shrimp in butter, and ground turkey. All cook fine and do not stick. I used no butter while cooking the eggs.Tips for surface longevity: Be sure to wash by hand, and don't use a metal spatula on these types of pans. Don't wash in the dishwasher. The Teflon will work longer. Washing by hand is quite easy."
negative,"One of the grossest movies I've ever seen.: I didn't find this movie scary, but it is gross. Cannibalism has to be the grossest thing going. The only movie I ever got physically sick during was Night of the Living Dead when the zombies are eating brains. I didn't get sick during this one but it is just as gross (probably even grosser). This is a vile, disgusting movie and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has even a little bit of class. Do not by any means spend the [money] or whatever they're asking for the DVD. If you get a chance to see it for free, look at it and judge for yourself. Completely awful and disgusting. Do you like people cutting themselves with razor blades? If you do, you'll probably like this disgusting piece of [film making]!"
negative,i agree with all the other one and two star reviewers: amazon has this great feature where you can select all the one star reviews. i did and was gratified by all the creative nd the original ways people said what amounts to the same thing.unlike the author of eragon the readers are creative and interesting. yeah the book has a greeat cover but that has nothing whatsoever to do with whats inside. you have to be really young or have lived in a cave to miss the fact that paolini copied and copied . plus he just doesn't have what it takes yet to write a good book. the hype is kinda difficult to believe on this one. a waste of money and a waste of time pretty much sums it up.
positive,"Lord of the youth classics!!: This is actually the only book I read that we were suppose to read when we were in high school. I just picked it back up over 10 years later to reread it and compare it to the other classics. I truly enjoyed this one. This could actually happen. I could picture myself in these kids shoes trying to survive, struggling for leadership and trying to stay cool when faced with totally anarchy. A great book for high school age boys if you are trying to get them hooked into reading. Very fast paced with little down time. Could be a one sitting read. What a great story."
positive,Janes All the worlds aircraft 1996-7: Great to deal with. Very quick delivery. Very highly recommended. Thank you.
positive,"More than entertainment. This could save a life.: Witness the inner workings of a sociopath's mind. Witness the impact of that mind on those around him.This DVD is terrifying and suspenseful, and more realistic than some would suspect. I highly recommend that parents watch this film with their children. Not only does Fear have tremendous entertainment value, it could open the lines of communication and prevent a young woman from becoming involved with disturbed people such as this.Recommended very highly."
positive,Amazing and a Classic: I loved this book and would read it many more times. I love the adventure in it and the plot. It definitely earned 5 stars! Buy it now and enjoy!
positive,FARBERWARE SAUCEPAN: I needed a three quart sauce pan and most of them came in sets or are very expensive. I've had good luck with other Farberware products for years so ordered the pan. It took about six days to arrive. It was well packed. The pan is as pictured. It heats well and cleans up very easily. I'm more than satisfied with this purchase.
negative,"Poor Quality of Keurigs: Keurigs-just plain suck! I am now on my 4th Machine in 18 months. I have had to return three machines back to Costco because they each stopped working after 3-7 months of ownership. I called Keurig after the last one failed and they wanted me to wait 10 days for a new unit; I told them to stuff it! After I finish using all the previously purchased pods with my new unit, I am finished with Keurigs. It is not worth the aggravation of my wife waking me up to tell me the machine is not working. I even purchased the filters and descale the machine monthly to no avail. Keurig-you just have a horrible product, period. May your company rest in peace."
positive,"No need for a review: This timeless story requres nothing else from me, other than to say that the images it invokes in the reader's mind cannot be portrayed on the silver screen, regardless of the talents of Hollywood's finest. I actually do not plan to see the movie because it could only disappoint."
negative,"Magical Mystery Tour: Similar to other Beatle releases of the 65-67 period, MMT has a few good songs, but more forgettable ones. The three notable songs on this release (Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields, and All You Need is Love) can be obtained on numerous greatest hits compilations."
positive,"A must read for every manager: I read this book when I first started working, and now ask all of my managers to read it when they first get promoted. Nothing complex in the message but it is all very true and helpful for new managers and old alike."
positive,"Easy install: Recieved it quickly, used it once and it works exactly as advertised. Very simple installation! Speedy delirvery, good installation instructions"
negative,"-: This product gave me no trouble in Windows XP SP1 or SP2. I also got it up and running on Windows 98. However, whenever I try to use it on a Windows 98V1, it will work with everyting except the internet. This is very annoying, and this is the computer we bought it for. The Netgear help desk hasn't helped either."
positive,"This book had me literally laughing out loud!: I took this book with me to work to read between customers and it had me laughing so hard people passing by were giving me odd looks. This is a great book. I would NOT say it characterizes ""normal American life"" -- but what is normal, anyway? (Who knows?)Sedaris is brilliant. I can't wait to read the other books he's written."
negative,"Disappointing: I was expecting a lot more humor. Actually, the last 5 minutes is the funniest and only made me grin."
negative,"Not worth the money: I purchased the Pampers Baby Dry by mistake and I hated them. They leak and they are hard. Pampers Swaddlers are excellent they NEVER leak, they are soft and comfortable for my baby boy. Stick with the Swaddlers or you'll not only be changing the babies diaper more often but you'll be changing the babies clothes and bedding too."
negative,"Too Chaotic: Although the modern Transformer series has incredible special effects, a movie needs more than that. The Transformers we new when we were younger were different, openly honest and strictly adhering to moral standards; but with the newer version,even the Good ones seem to be a bit more sinister and we're not always certain that they are on our side. The transformation sequence is extremely confusing and hard to follow, unlike the simpler older style. I do not like many movies these days because Hollywood seems bent on reinventing the legend of whatever character or franchise they take on, for their own purposes. There is some of that here. With some unnecessary bathroom humor as well. Strictly for special effects fans only."
negative,Why Subtitles?: I need to send this dvd back to you. It has subtitles in French. It does not say anything about this on the packaging nor did I order it this way. I was not satisfied with this dvd. I will ship it back and exchange it for a dvd in English with no subtitles. Sandra Birchfield
negative,"Is being a Witch really this hard????: This was one of the first books I picked up when I first started studying the Craft, right along with Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practioner. I found it as alot of jibberish, granted there was some decent parts, most of it seemed like it was written for her and only her and those she teaches. I found most of it difficult to understand, and her version of the Craft seemed so organized; for instance, your altar MUST look like this. Needless to say, Cunninghams book I finished, Ms Cabot's, I did not."
positive,Great workbook: This book is a great study guide to prepare for the certification exam. The book is easy to read and it leaves out all the fluff that is in the other study books. After reading and doing the practice exams I found what my weaknesses were and was able to go back to my schoolbooks to strengthen those areas. I took the certification exam this month (March) and think I did fine; there are a lot of math questions in the exam and wish I spent more time in that area.If I were to do this all over I would recommend buying Calculations: The pharmacy technician series.
negative,"This version is horrible!!!!: I cannot believe so many people actually like this version!!! The music is more suited to a funeral, then to soothing a baby!!!! The motor is so loud, I can hear it in my bedroom!!! Even my 19 year old son said, that it was terrible compared to the first aquarium!!! My 18 month old son doesn't find it nearly as interesting as the old one. Sometimes it pays to NOT improve a product!!!!!"
negative,"Sick, dull, and insulting: Talk about a waste of paper! Shoot, I've read books that left me wanting my money back, but this one left me wishing thay used the paper and ink to print coloring books!Set in the wood, a bunch of guys who once saved a handicapped person from eating a turd are menaced by aliens. Some fungus grows, and a evil/crazy army general runs around playing Rolling Stones tunes, and by the end you no longer care what the point was.I've seen the quality of Kings books as a downward slide after Salems' Lot, so guess this is sort of the literary version of ""Freddy Got Fingered"" In other words, it's so bad, sovile, and so poorly written that people are going to line up to throw more money into King's pockets."
positive,"Clay Measures Up!: This CD is composed of 12 wonderful pop ballads, that exploit the breadth and depth of Clay Aiken's amazing vocal talent. From the opening song, ""Invisible"", to the pop-country tune, ""The Way"", the Beatle-esque ""Shine"", ""This is The Night"", and the final song, ""Touch"" (suprisingly, a Justin Timberlake-style song which Clay makes his own), this CD is pure ear candy. Kudos to the producer and those behind the scenes who pulled together this entire set of songs for Clay's debut CD. It is fresh and pure enjoyment."
negative,"On the Road Again.: Ok. Let's talk like ordinary people. If you are someone who has to buy a new TV unless you have one, only because the TV is more modern this is your book. If you've read ""ON THE ROAD"", maybe you'll want read something diferent. This is the same book, the same drama, the same wasted money. Can this book change your life?? Yes, but also a stone at high speed could do it also and in less time. Ally McBeal or a Backstreet boys song have more message than this book."
negative,"Very disappointing and very shallow: Ms. Powell's book, which I eagerly anticipated, bombed as far as I'm concerned. A complete disappointment. Flippant, ignorant about food and cooking techniques, Ms. Powell is hardly the person to be taken as an expert on food, even if she did cook a lot of Julia Child's recipes (and yet Bon Appetit and other publications, including The Washington Post, are falling all over themselves offering Ms. Powell writing assignments--it goes to show how much such publications really do seek new, fresh voices in food writing--take note, all you food writers out there!). Superficial and not worth the time."
negative,"Don't Buy Me *They did help: I purchased this item last year and have used it about 5 times. While steaming some tamales last night, not only did the pot turn my oven covers completely black (currently soaking in baking soda and vinegar) but upon further review the bottom lip of the pot is completely separated from the remainder of the pot. What the heck? I am going to throw this in the dumpster now. Unless you guys will refund me. * After posting this I got a positive email from the company. Thank you guys"
positive,"Vintage Vital Phil Keaggy: Released in 1987, but now out-of-print, this a magnificent album that presents Phil Keaggy at his compositional and guitar-playing best. ""Paradise Dream"", ""The Wind & The Wheat, and ""The Reunion"" are prime examples. Hopefully, it will be reissued, perhaps even as an all-acoustic guitar album."
negative,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being Boring: This is well acted, beautifully filmed...and pretentious exitentialist tripe. There's a difference between TRYING to be deep and serious, and being deep and serious. This movie doesn't know the difference. Long and slow."
negative,"lizards?: I aggree with the Kirkus review above. ""Intriguing and panoramic but circuitous and uncompelling, and lacking even a token ending.... a meandering journey of unspecified duration.""UNCOMPELLING being the key word here. The aliens being Lizards just didn't do for me either. Ruined it. It was a great idea but the lizards blew it.The story: During World War II we are invaded by lizard aliens."
positive,"Nice Movie: This movie is about a group of singers (inspired by the Supremes) that start out playing in junkie competitions and how they made it to the big time. The band goes through numerous fractures and toes are stepped on. I will let you discover the plot on your own but I have a feeling this is a very realistic story of the supposed glitz and glamor of show business.I liked this movie but I felt that it got too long. It was about two hours long, not a horrible length, but some parts just seemed to drag on despite the actors' great talents (including amazing singing). If you feel like you are somewhat interested in this movie, I recommend that you rent it when you're not too tired but ready to sit down for a long time, get some pop and junk food, and relax on the couch with a friend.I am not a huge fan of musicals, but this was a pretty good movie. Nothing fantastic, but good."
positive,"Simply heavenly: We play this CD for our daughter quite often to soothe her ... and especially when nothing else will calm her down. The music is lovely, Olivia's voice is breathtaking, and we haven't yet gotten sick of it! I highly recommend it!"
positive,"By far Clancy's best work to date!: If you love Tom Clancy's books or your just looking for a great read, this is the book for you. Clancy manages to interweave geo-politics, military action, dahm good chracters and a non stop thrill ride of a plot into a book you won't be able to put down. This book has everything or as Ronald Raegan would say it is the perfect yarn."
negative,"WHY?: I bought the OW Aquarium thinking it would be another great product like the PP Aquarium. I was wrong. My son has been falling asleep to the Peaceful Planet Aquarium for two years. Sometimes the PP Aquarium would get stuck, so I bought the Ocean Wonders Aquarium to replace it. I had to return it because my son does not like it one bit. The motor is too loud and the music is strange. I also think the aquarium is too large. My son and I hope Fisher Price comes out with a new aquarium that is similar to the first one."
positive,"What it says it is: It arrived on time, was as described. I gave this as a gift, and I'm not a singer, but the person I gave it to, says it's wonderful."
negative,Buyer Beware: This was a VERY used paperback of Tess sold as new with library stickers on the binding as well as the front cover. Amazon is definitely not trustworthy anymore.
positive,"Great Nailer to Own: This is my second (I dropped the first one from 30 feet) N62. I loved my first one. It performed well for the 4 months I owned it. I purchased the Bostich to replace a Senco that I had many problems with. I especially appreciate the light weight and durability....yes, durability!! The magnesium case and plastic magazine performed without a flaw (although I was a bit skeptical at first).The nails sold here on Amazon have worked quite well. I have used 1.5"", 2.0"" & 2.5"" and they are less expensive that the lumber yard and the home stores.I would recommend this unit to anyone interested in a 15 GA nailer."
positive,"Great Christmas read.: The description inside talks about pictures. There was only text, no pictures in the Kindle version. Drawings would have been nice."
positive,"Raises important issues and offers viable solutions: I read Robert Frank's book, Luxury Fever, right after finishing Barbara Kingsolver's new book, The Poisonwood Bible. I recommend both and I recommend reading them in this order. Kingsolver points out the callous and self-serving nature of middle and upper-class America in a very emotional way. Frank points out the same in a much more dispassionate way and then offers viable solutions. I found this book to be well-written, even-handed, thorough, and absorbing. I highly recommend it."
positive,"The Perfect Book: This book was excellent. The concepts were well-defined and clearly explained. Upon completion, I am more enlightened and aware of the field of statistical analysis."
negative,"Save your money: I told a friend recently that I had read this book. She asked if I were going to see the movie and I immediately answered NO. I don't want to give that woman (author Julie/Julia Powell) any more of my money. Things to admire about Powell; her imagination and persistance. Many more things not to admire including her gloating at the ""end"" of the book about how she is now lounging in her pajamas with her cats etc. thanks to the money fools like myself laid out for her writing efforts. Fool me once..."
negative,"Too much Julie, not enough Julia: Two stars is generous...unfortunately (and I tried so very hard) I could not finish this book and left it in a rental house in Florida over the holidays for someone else to read.Desperately in need of editing...perhaps there is a real generation gap in that I found the author to be very naive. This shouldn't be shelved in the cookbook section of bookstores--a memoir is more like it. If you're interested, take it out of the library."
positive,"Perfect replacement;): These earrings are gorgeous! The shipping was fast and I am very pleased. A great replacement for my precious moldavite earrings I had lost the week before, but now I am not as sad because these are prettier than the old ones;)This company is great and have had no problems with them. Plan to order more in the future!"
negative,Depressing: I was looking forward to it because the previews make it look so good. I waited over a year to get this movie. Very dissappointing and depressing... too uch time spent on Robert DeNiro's time getting to the kids.... very depressing story.
positive,"it does it's job: I read the reviews before buying this product and one review said it made loud nose as dial turns.. and s/he is completly right. The noise it makes is pretty loud.. I would NOT recommend this for the bedroom if you are going to use it as some type of sleep timer b/c the noise will bother you. However, I have this installed on my storage room in the kitchen, so the noise is not an issue."
positive,"Its a book Ill never forget: Bilbo Baggins, a ordinary hobbit stumbles upon a grand adventure for a treasure with a few dwarves. Will he earn this treasure with the dwarves? Or will dangers of his journey defeat him?This book was unforgettable, I bet alot of others readers agree. Also it has a lesson ,to never give up. The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien deserves even more then 5 stars."
negative,"Sudden Death of a Ball: The Amazon return period expired on Feb. 7Almost to the day two months later the ball i was comfortably sitting on at worked popped and deflated and landed me on the floor during a business meeting.Embarrassed? A little. Especially because I have been telling everybody int the office hwo great this ball is and how well it works for me.I will return it to Amazon and will send e message to the manufacturer. Fortunately nobody was hurt.I hope the company will replace the ball without any problems, especially since there were no sharp objects involved and I think I am not too heavy at 195 lb.I'll continue writing when I receive a reply from the manufacturer or Amazon."
positive,"Special voice: Enya has an amazing voice and each of her songs allows you to listen to how special her voice truely is. I had never bought any of Enya's music until about a year ago, and I was blown away when I listened to a little clip on Amazon.com the site suggested that due to my interests I might want it, and it was right. I have since asked for (and gotten) the large 4 CD set of her from my husband for my birthday back in Jan, and bring it in the car, to work and back home again."
positive,"Palaver with Palance: Perfect casting, careful pacing, and precise characterizations are the specialties of this suspenseful film noir. Of particular interest is the plot's patient development of the relationship between Crawford and Palance, an intricate bond that continues to intrigue as the harmony of their home begins to ring hollow. Palance's powerful sex appeal is like a lightning rod that draws both Crawford and Grahame, and, though nothing in the storyline comes as a shock, the details are utterly jolting!"
negative,"Reads Like Keel's dropped his notes and never rearranged them: Excellent and suspenseful information. All over the place as far as the material. We travel back and forth from West Virgina to London to Ohio... and back again. Would have enjoyed it if the first part of the book was supporting information as to the phenomena itself and how it has indeed appeared elsewhere in history, how the phenomena ties to UFO sightings etc. but Keel's hypothesis that all paranormal activity comes from a parallel universe it difficult to believe, even for paranormal studies. I'm sure that is a first.Although the book was suspenseful and written well, it was just organized poorly. Revise, John. You can do it."
positive,Funny: This movie is very funny and entertaining but using the Mario Brothers name maybe they shouldn't have.
positive,Best deal ever: A 4 pack of the blades is 16 dollars at Walmart which is usually the cheapest place for blades . You can't go wrong with this price for a 12 pack .
negative,"Nothing like the original!: While I agree this pan is good looking, it's not good cooking! Takes a long time to heat up and bottom does not heat evenly. If I'd known Farberware had changed their ""classic"" pan, I wouldn't have bought it. My advice--look for another brand."
positive,"Great movie! Played just fine: Finally added this gem of a movie to our collection, don't know why we didn't do it sooner. the end"
positive,Good book about bugs.: This book is great for identifying insects and other 'bugs'. The pictures are large and close up. My grandson loves it.
negative,"Way too many ads: In the February 2013 mag there are 40 full page adds for some kind of dietary suplaments and 18 other full page ads of a total of 120 pages. There are also a few 1/3 & 1/2 page ads. So all togather about half of the mag is advertisements. The mag is alsofull of graphics and full page pics. There are only a few articles and they are generally not presenting original, thought provoking material.I canceled my subscription after three issues. Maybe this mag is geared more toward body builders that can't read."
negative,"This is not Pearl Jam's finest moments!: This is not one of Pearl Jam's better albums. The typewritter at the end was more satisfying to my ears than the music itself! What happened to their old melodies? The last couple of albums, I have not enjoyed. The only thing fascinating about this album is the head phone trick for 2 of the songs. (Surround sound). Other than that, I should have saved my money."
negative,Never Get the Chance to Let Me down Again: Not able to tell from the packaging I regretfullypurchased this pricey deluxe edition only to findthe last four songs have been removed from the CD.Not ending with Pleasure Little Treasure makes thewhole nostalgic vaunt all vapid and hollow.Disc 2 contains the catchier more enjoyable tracksfrom the singles along with what I call the missingtracks although some would argue. Alas they can onlybe played on a DVD player not a car stereo. Kind of aworthless novelty albeit deliberate.
positive,"A classic - and a fun read: I've read and been a fan of the fantasy genre for a relatively long time - about twenty years at this point. It is only now that I am getting around to reading Tolkien's stuff. The Hobbit is a great read, it's fun, simple, and has a good story. I'm more familiar with the LoTR stuff than this book due to the movies, and so it was nice to read the ""prequel"" so-to-speak. I liked JRRT's writing style - and his world-building, while rudimentary here, I think, was great. I can appreciate it for the huge breakthrough it was at the time. I greatly look forward to reading the followup, Lord of The Rings, very soon."
positive,"Super book for even a younger audience: We bought this book 2 years ago for our then 6 year old son, who was an early reader. He took this book to bed with him every night, reading himself to sleep. The pictures are colorful and the text is inviting for young children, even though the age range stated on Amazon is 9 - 12 years. I think the marketing people might want to reconsider the age range toward a younger audience. Teachers and friends would often ask how he knew a particular fact, and he'd answer honestly, from ""The Book of Knowledge."" The book is now falling apart from use and he's asked for a new one. It still captures his imagination."
positive,Maurice: I saw this movie during its theatrical release years ago. I wanted to see how it measured up against today's standards. It is still an interesting and compelling picture.
positive,"I can't believe it's not butter!: It's hard to believe that, in its prime, this was considered maybe the greatest picture ever made. It wasn't and it isn't. And yet, Barbieri's score and Storaro's cinematography are still a delight to both ear and eye (although you can see the camera's reflection on a window pane at the last scene!).Regarding sex, there's not much to be said. In fact, there was a lot said and little to be seen. Brando gives ""the performance of a lifetime"", which in his case, after seeing ""Superman"", is probably true. Maria Schneider is so, so; Jean Pierre Laúd is execrable and Mássimo Girotti all but steals the show as Brando's funny-you-should-ask rival. All in all, much ado about... butter!"
negative,"Neat pictures, not much info: The title would lead one to believe that this book would help explain the foundation and workings of the Mormon faith. This is not the case. The limited text supplies the reader with just a basic explanation of what is being depicted in the photo. This is a good book for someone just interested in getting a superficial intro to this belief system, but nothing more."
negative,"Waste of paper: I recently had to read this book as part of my English GCSE and I can honestly say that much paper has been wasted and our trees are being destroyed to churn out a book, which is quite frankly absolutly awfull. I also am very glad that I was not around to ever meet Thomas Hardy as from this book it sounds to me that he may well of been a manic depresent, also in most, if not all, of his other books they all end in a very sad a depressing way. Hardy describes Henchard as 'dogged' and i feel if you want to read this you too will have to be dogged and determind to start and finish this book."
negative,"Waste of Time: I was asked to read this book, and I thought the title was interesting. Well, I was wrong. The only good part was the last chapter!!! Here is a basic synopsis of the book: A bunch of boys are stranded on an Island. They know how they got there, an airplane. None of them know each other (unless they went to school with others), yet they were all on the same plane. The pilot did not survive. Some of the boys become obssessed with killing while others are obssessed with being rescued. Kids die and a few turn cannibalistic. I won' t tell you the end, but there is absolutely no point in reading this book unless you like being bored out of your mind when reading. By the way, the title has relatively nothing to do with the book."
negative,"Stupid book, geared towards morons.: This book is a joke! It covers different stories told supposedly by women in Exotic positions, such as strippers, prostitutes and porn stars. The stories are very well made up, at least the author has a creative mind. All it really talks about is the hundreds of lovers these women take on, nothing else."
negative,"The Last Juror is a sure miss!: It's been awhile since I read a John Grisham novel because I'm not a big fan of contemporary writing. However, after reading the dust cover of The Last Juror, I was hooked. I braced myself for a thriller reminscent of A Time to Kill (after all both books were set in the same small Mississippi town). I was sorely disappointed. Grisham tosses in almost everything but the kitchen sink in this novel as he waxes poetic on small town life in Mississippi, the evils of Wal-Mart, and the wonders of Southern cooking. This is a great sentimental novel but as a thriller it lacks punch."
negative,"Two thumbs down - way down!: This book was in one word - boring. It talks about the first academy awards...blah, blah, blah...and then the latest. The book is filled with usless babble that isn't even worth knowing! Listen people - DO NOT waste your money buying this book and/or your time reading this book! What a wasteful piece of crap..."
positive,"Wow: David S. Ware (b. 1949) is an incredibly talented tenor saxophonist who reminds me of a young Archie Shepp. This music is open and edgy, demanding listeners to let it inside. Ware represents a corner of the jazz world that continues to create, evolve and inspire modern listeners and critics with a sound uniquely his own. He is one of a handful pushing ahead on the cutting edge of freeform jazz music.""Surrendered"", recorded in October of 1999, is a superb endeavor with Ware accompanied by the following musicians: Matthew Shipp (piano), William Parker (bass) and Guillermo E. Brown (drums). Ware's musings are careful yet unreserved, at once appearing as violent as they do tame. Occasionally Shipp pops up from the background with a stellar piano solo for audiences, with Parker and Brown forming the makes of a solid rhythm section. This album is well worth the price."
negative,"Very interesting.: I think the arthur was really desperate when he set out to write a book about the people that is not his race and at the time of his travel, the people he wrote about were normads and now today, they are reading his book. It is interesting."
positive,"Good Historical Fiction Western: OK, I am only in 8th grade, and I just finished it. Is it me, or is America getting more stupid by the second? This book requires a lot of your brain power. It implies a lot of things. But seriously people, how easy can understanding this be? To any intellegent people out there, this book will suit you fine. If you especially like historical fiction, and westerns also, you'll love this. I don't even like historical fiction, and I liked it! I hope you enjoy it!"
positive,"wonderful easy read: Patterson's writing style is easy to follow and enjoy. In this latest novel, which is a bit of a departure from most of his other work, we have the story of Jennifer whose grandmother Sam has fallen into a coma and later dies, leaving behind the revelation of a secret passion for a mysterious ""Doc"" who taught her how to laugh and love when she was stuck in a hard and boring marriage. In the process, Jennifer re-meets an old friend, Brendan, and a passion of her own is awakened for him. But he's in the fight of his life against cancer. How will that end? This is a memorable story that will stay with you for quite some time, especially if you're a romantic at heart.David rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
positive,"Herbalife Formula 1 Nutrional Shake Mix Review: I'm on my second canister, I find the ""vanilla"" flavor a bit too much, so I throw in some frozen rasberries and it really makes a huge difference, cuts down on the ""rich"" sweetness. Sometimes I want a meal replacement but do not necessarily want it to taste like dessert, so tweaking this a bit and adding your favorite frozen fruit or nut butter, etc. is a great way to go. I also like this product because it really does keep me full, like a ""regular"" meal would. I use this product for weight loss, replacing one meal with shake, instead of the recommended ""two"" because im already on a raw food type diet, so im not taking in a whole lot of calories anyway. So far in 9 weeks, I've lost 15 lbs. Im very satisfied with these shakes and glad I found out about them."
positive,"Oh my goodness....: To reread these classics and then see how current and relevant it is for today is amazing. Parlor and screens, Internet and Facebook. Value of justice and human life each placed below entertainment all to be wiped clean and reset. We are all poorer at the loss of the author."
negative,"Started out good..: I read this book before it became an Oprah pick- and was almost appalled that she had chosen it as something she deemed worthy for others to spend their precious time reading! It started out good to me, I didn't mind the magic realism. I actually thought it was quite charming. But after awhile it seemed that the story just went on, and on, and on... with no real end in sight. Most of the book just seemed kind of like page fillers to me,with no real significance to the story. I was ready to put the book down before I got even half way through, but forced myself to trudge through it to the bitter end. As far as recommendations go, I would recommend passing on this book- or at least borrowing it from a devoted Oprah book club reader. Don't spend your money on it."
negative,"Decent Content, terrible format.: I had to purchase this book for a philosophy class I'm taking, and it's been painful to read. At first I thought it was because I'm used to my kindle, but when compared to other paper books, the printing is awful. It feels like I'm staring at a wall of text, and the lines tend to merge together. There needs to be more space in between the lines, and it would go a long way if the pages were not so bright. I think this is the first book I've ever seen with this problem, and I hope it's the last.As far as the content of the book is concerned, it's about what I'd expect from a basic philosophy book, so that's not really an issue."
positive,"the best of anastacia: this would be a good time for america to wake up and embrace this tremendously talented singer. how this woman is not as successful in the usa as she is in europe is beyond me. so many great songs here. from the dance/pop/r+b of her first two albums, to the rock influenced hits from her third album. this is a great way to catch up if you've missed out on anastacia.also includes ""everything burns"" with ben moody from evanesence and her gorgeous duet with italian superstar eros romazotti, ""i belong to you"""
negative,"Not tea tree oil: The number one ingredient in this product is soy bean oil. That's not what I wanted. Also, I saw it at Walmart and it was only 2 dollars."
negative,"A Good Translation but still disappointed: This version of the Canterbury Tales in modern English is brilliant. Nonetheless I was deeply disappointed in finding that the Parson's Tale was omitted completely, the reason being that ""it does not interest the general public"". I disagree with such a sweeping statement."
positive,quality journal...slow order processing: I was disappointed that it took months to process my subscription. I don't know if the delay was amazon.com or Nursing2006. I placed my order in November and did not receive it until late February. I am very pleased with the content of the journal though.
negative,"Inproper Advertising: I needed to replace a lost CD set of the library CD book: Cruel and Unusual by Patricia Cornwell. The one I ordered from Amazon was listed as a CD set (not as a cassette set) so I ordered it. I received a Cassette set of the book and NOT a CD set of the book. I wrote (through Amazon) to the seller and their reply was that I received a CD set.The Librarians can vouch for what I received as I showed them the envelope and the contents within it. Even though it was my responsibility to replace the CD book (so I wouldn't have to pay the Library charge), I now had to give that job to the library. Need I say more?This time, and it's the first time, Amazon has a very disgruntled customer.Thanks for asking for the review. Maybe Amazon could check into this and prevent others from experiencing what I experienced.Sincerely,Sherry BohmP.S. Yes, my husband and I are still Amazon shoppers. We're just going to have to be more careful now."
negative,"Awful: I was excited to try this vibrator at first because of the addition of the beads. I was really disappointed in this product however. It's awkward to handle, using it and trying to use the buttons at the same time takes away from the focus on the sensations. The beads are far from pleasure enhancing, they felt awkward and sometimes pinch a bit if you change the direction during use. They are also bulky and and uncomfortable. The plastic is smooth on the outside which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I personally prefer some texture, it's also really thin where the beads are, which I suppose is to allow sensation but considering I didn't like the way the beads felt... I would've preferred thicker plastic."
negative,"Defective product that should be garbaged, not sold.: I have a very large house, So I need four doorbells to be able to hear in all of the areas. I thought that the cheap price of these doorbells was a bargain, but you get what you pay for. When I first opened the boxes I was impressed with the nice wood covers. unfortunately the plastic stems that connect the grommets to the chime bar were broken off. I thought this might just be one bad apple of the bunch. But after opening the rest of the doorbells I found out that all four of them were defective and broken in the same spots. This was very frustrating since it wasted my time and money. I will not ever buy another product with the Broan name on it and I advise you not to either."
positive,"I LOVED the movie, then i learned the hard part....: i thought this movie was really good. i especially like all the good music and dancing. i used to watch this movie over and over and over, and then i learned the horrible truth. that, in real life, jennifer gray and patrick swayze hate each other. this ruined the whole movie for me. i hope i didn't ruin the movie for you if you didn't already know this."
negative,"It was awful!!!: I'm sorry to say, and sorry to use this language, but it sucked. Pretty much what other reivewers said is true. What a terrible disappointement. I read the first one over 20 years ago, and wanted and waited for this one. What a let down. What a ripoff!"
negative,Gave a rash: The baby dry diapers left a rash on my baby. Not a diaper rash another kind of rash. I will never use these again.
positive,"For those with a creative wire: Like the wooden Maquettes that are found in Art Stores, Blue Benders are fun to manipulate in many different poses. I think Art Students of all ages will find them *LOTS* of fun to create scenarios with two or more Blue Benders. I would warn against buying a Blue Bender for childen under the age 9 because the wire body is delicate and they may break and the broken wire may hurt the child. As a Student of Art myself, I have fun creating different scenes with all the Blue Bender family members."
positive,"Oldie but still a goodie: For those of you who enjoy dance movies, here is one for you! This has been around since the mid-1980's and is still an all time favorite of mine. The music and dance moves are very addictive. Great soundtrack. The actors in this movie are all wonderful, many who have gone on to thier own successful shows. Definately worth checking out at least once, or twice, or in my case...just buy the movie!"
negative,"Piece of junk!: This would be a nifty little contraption if it wasn't for the fact that you can't change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.I have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus. I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder. Oh, and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort."
negative,Disappointed: Jan Karon's writings are among the best I've read - that's why this last book I found disappointing - very slow and I couldn't identify/relate to Agnes or with Father Tim's relationship with her. Maybe the author was trying to replace or reinvent Miss Sadie.
positive,"Huffington is at her usual best: Anyone that works in a corporate environment needs to be interested in the role multinational conrporations have on the global economy. The Corporation is a very inteersting entity, largely unchecked and left to its own conscience in many respects. Huffington explores this road."
positive,"Warriors: Warriors is a wonderfull book. It is well written, and although it has a wide vocabulary, you can understand the words the Erin Hunter uses. Warriors definately deserves 5 stars. The series has a fast paced story line, and relates the adventures of cats with human stuggles. Although in some books, the depression that the cats go through is almost un-bearable, most of the times the books are light and cheerfull. I would recomend these books to any young reader who enjoys books like Inkheart, Harry Potter, and Time Stops for No Mouse."
positive,"Invisible invaders/ Journey to the seventh planet: The Invisible Invaders is an early zombie type of story with the aliens invading dead bodies. It's a cold war movie, so of course they want to take over the world. It was engaging and creepy enough to watch more than once.Where ever did someone find Journey to the Seventh Planet? By the odd way some words are pronounced it wasn't made in America. It was imaginative, however, some of the plot was copped later by the writers of the origial Star Trek. Lonely alien on Uranus seeks playmates to help it get to Earth. It creates places for astronauts to interact with women from their past. See: Star Trek. Don't miss the song played during the credits. I can't remember the words, but it reminded me of the theme song from the Love Boat."
positive,"Quintessential Xmas Spirit: Amazing, wonderful book that should need no introduction, but for those who aren't yet familiar with it, reading this novel will definitely sate your appetite for a good story, put you in touch with your humanity and bring out your Christmas cheer. Written in simple, lucid language, it can be reread as many times as you like, whether you be old or young. I strongly recommend a Christmas Carol."
negative,"Get to the point, King!!!: I was very excited to read the new King book, especially since this was supposed to be his big comeback to horror. However, with the exception of ONE scene in the book, NOTHING at all was terrifying. Not scary, not even a little creepy. King had 879 pages to work with and did nothing with them. Sure, the writing itself is good -- no one denies that. But he needed to get to the point a lot sooner. Master horror authors such as Bentley Little and Richard Laymon could have wrote this book much more effectively in less than half the space! He rambles on and on and on. Maybe the reason this book is so mediocre is that King's real-life car accident did permanent damage to his brain."
negative,"a stinker: This book is a stinker. Here's the deal...think of some catchy metaphor (e.g., life is a climb, life is a portrait, life is a ladder...something like that). Come up with a ""theory"" around the metaphor (e.g., you can climb or camp when you have a problem, you can copy a picture or create your own, etc.) Do a chapter on each idea (Chapter #1: Climbing, Chapter #2; Camping, etc.). Get friends and family members to ""review"" the book (favorably of course). If you have success, consider spinoffs like climbing at work, climbing at home, etc. Voila! You're an author and an expert! Now, hit the trail as a motivational speaker.This pretty much explains this one! Save your money and come up with your own book.Heh, maybe YOU can be an author and a motivational speaker!"
negative,"NOT SAFE!!: Althought the aspect of being able to splash in the water is what drew me to this float, my 10 month old equally enjoyed the ease of climbing out of the float. I bought this for our vacation and because it was so dangerous I ended up holding her the entire time we were in the water! Buyer beware!!"
positive,"This is a great tool to help you winterize your RV: I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer. Simply screw it on to your water hook-up, and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you're in business.The tip is flexible, but secure. That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex. This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again."
positive,"Keith Jarrett may be eccentric, but he is good.: The first time I heard ""Solara March,"" I played it 14 straight times. Even today, 4/26/08, I played it three times. It is that good. Say what you like about Keith Jarrett. Dude can flat play the piano. This is the kind of CD you listen on a long drive, or alone at home with no intrusions."
positive,"Great characters, hard to put the book down...: This was a good book in many ways, the characters were extremely well developed, I felt like I got to know them personnally.. and the setting was great. I think the book should continue. I was only a bit disappointed by the overall ""story"" with so many great characters it seemed like we were being set up for something great... but i think the story itself could have been further developed. There has to be another novel... we were all left hanging a bit. I hope she does write more... I would say that she is one of the better sci fi writers i have read in a while, (reminds me a bit of Dan Simmons books, a bit like Dune books). I recommend the book!"
negative,"The Longest Movie: I watched on June 6th 2004 ""The Longest Day"" to learn about D-Day June 6th in 1944. In general it was a painfully boring movie. I accomplished my goal of learning about D-Day, but it was at a cost of wasting about three hours of my life. It is my belief that this story could have been told in one and a half hours instead of three."
negative,"Extremely Disappointed with this video: I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know."
positive,"Let's hear it for the ECM!: I've known Jim for a while now. And I suppose that might colour my impression of this, his first published full-length novel. Fortunately, it doesn't need to.This is a wonderful book. The characters are believable. The story is fluid and while there are number of things that aren't explained (no Trek physics! Yay!), it isn't necessary for you to understand how FTL works or YouthBoost...noteven the folks in the story understand it.Festina Ramos, our heroine, is a real person. Not in the sense that she exists in our reality...I don't know if she does or not, nor, in the long run, do I need to. But in this story, she's alive and real and very full of that vitality that makes you care about someone.Read this book. Really. If you like SF. If you like strong, believable characters. If you want to kill a day reading.Just go read it. It's worth it, for whatever you're looking for."
positive,My teen boys laughed out loud.: I love Danny Kaye movies that I saw in my youth. I get so happy when I share something from my younger days with my teenage sons and it is a hit.This movie was. I love their innocence. And laughing at a movie like this makes me feel youthful. I only hope that my teen boys are not unique in their appreciation of the oldies. A great movie for a family with young children. Danny Kaye is so childlike in his actions that this movie can't miss with your young ones.
negative,"Please do not watch, this is 2hrs you will never get back: This movie was horrible. If you enjoy crossword puzzles you make like this movie if your intoxicated. But if you just want straight entertainment select something else. I have no problem with a movie challenging me as a viewer, but it repeated the same scenes several times and still did not provide a solution to the main character's problem. For a suspense/horror this movie was a straight H.A.M. (Hot A$$ Mess)."
positive,"Daughter wanted this movie: This is the actual movie she wanted for Christmas. She has watched it numerous times although it is in French. She loves period films, b/w films and wanted this in French. SHe is very happy with this movie."
negative,"Starts with a bang ends with a whimper.: The beginning the book was superb. Hayden was smitten to say the least...Lottie was also intrigued and curious about this dashing, murderering marquess. The characters were instantly likeable that I was sure that the rest of the book would be equally so. That is until he marries her and takes her home and things turn really bad. His kid made me nuts, his emotional scars was so convoluted it was ridiculous. I was so sick of this guy and his problems by the end of the story I was hoping she would high-tail it out of there. Grrr...this could have been a great book ...man was I disappointed."
negative,Incomplete kit: I received this product from Amazon without applicator pad and with one bottle broken (Quik detailer). The bottle was broken in pack process because the box don't show external damage.
negative,"Nirvana Sliver Best Of The Box: As a long time Kurt Cobain fan ,Kurt was the reason I learned guitar years ago ,I was always a singer and songwriter since I was young but when Nirvana came out in 1991 I learned guitar as well cause the man inspired me too not just sing but write my own riffs.on this release save the money and buy the whole box set it is worth it, except for Courtney being the Yoko Ono money whore that she is and saving these extra demo tracks for this cd instead of putting every last outake demo live etc on last years boxed set.so you have to buy this cd just for the 3 new tracks.I know Courtney has enough money so I would'nt buy this cd.Kurt should not be remembered this way with his widow milking every dollar she could get.I will make sure if I become famous that only my children would be in control of my music who would treat it with respect."
negative,"Easy installation but unreliable Firewire slots, slow warranty repair: I've had this card installed since Nov. 2006 and just now found out that the 2 Firewire ports only work intermittently. I thought my new camcorder was messed up when I tried to use the Firewire port on the Iogear card. But when I plugged into another non-Iogear available Firewire slot, the camcorder worked. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to get warranty work for the Iogear card. The USB ports on the card have worked okay.Update: Over 3 weeks and I'm still awaiting my warranty work repair/replacement from Iogear.3-23-07 Update: Finally got the warranty replacement. Everything seems to be working now. I would now rate this about 3 stars."
positive,"fantastic! I love this ring. This is the 2nd one I've owned (I had to go up a size recently, due to some unfortunatweight gain): i've bought this ring from Sabrina Silver twice now, and BOTH times I have been MORE than satisfied with both the speed of receipt as well as the high quality of her products. I highly recommend the product and the seller!"
positive,Training film: All large corporations should use this as a training film.Having worked for a large company this is how they work.The forms are more important than the work.
positive,"Owned these for years, they're great!: I love the look of these, and they've been a great value--about seven years ago I bought four of all 4 sizes, and only two are gone (my grandchildren love the oversized ones)! In 40 years, I never found glasses that went with everything, and survived, so I'm stocking up with this large set of my favorite sizes. Thank you, Amazon.com!"
negative,"dont waste your time: I've been a huge GFK fan for years now and this is by far the biggest piece of crap i have ever wasted my money on. I would enjoy watching this CD smashed to pieces more than I would enjoy EVER listening to it again. Don't get me wrong, Supreme Clientele is one of my favs, but if Tical 0 doesn't just blow me away, I am giving up on the Wu for good."
negative,"a trick: you find it almost impossible to determine the translator of this book, either from the amazon description or even from an examination of the physical book itself. only by an in-depth reading of almost the entire introduction is it made clear that the translation is quite old, and considered one of the worst. surprised eco put his name to this."
negative,Uninteresting people doing uninteresting things while saying really really uninteresting things: I thought I would really enjoy this book as it takes places in a neighborhood of London in which I lived many years ago. But the characters are perhaps the most uninteresting I have ever encountered in a novel and their precious dialogue is beyond boring. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because there is a lot of good writing in this book - but to no purpose. Highly unrecommended.
positive,The Hound of Baskerville: The book is what I would call an intriguing tease. Doyle creates a mood throughout the whole book that keeps the reader sitting on the edge of their seat. I would definitely recommend this book for those readers who like a good mystery.
positive,"thrilling thriller: This mini-series is a taut thriller that I recommend to anyone. It's no surprise that an American version is in the works. It is well written, the charcters are real, the choice of actors is perfect, and none of the dialogue is gratuitous. Very compelling TV."
negative,"TIRED, FORMULAIC DRIVEL: I am not a fan of Mel Gibson, nor am I a fan of Helen Hunt. Their pairing here is not endearing. The jokes are tired. The story stale. The idea of a chauvinistic, womanising man getting electrocuted and then magically living through the ordeal only to be able to read the minds of all women he encounters... in his dreams. A man this callous and shallow would not use this power to become a gentler, more sensitive man. He would use it to get exactly what he wanted. Sure, his character does exploit his new gift to an extent, but of course, the end is just picture-perfect because he has become so sensitive and soft-hearted that he can practically read the mind of leading lady Helen Hunt even without his improbable skill. I am not impressed."
positive,"Never bought the first one, this isn't bad.: Considering how much bad music is out there these days, this was nice to come across. Covers a wide range of topics and moods, musicianship is pretty good. I'd recommend it to just about anyone. My tastes are usually heavier and more progressive - Rush, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Queensryche. But I like this disc too."
positive,"the best video out there: its a great video, thats not a bootleg, and has the marilyn manson seal of quality *grin*"
negative,"Poor customer support: The printer worked fine for about a year (no borderless prints though). After 15 months it started jamming every single time that I tried to print. I expected a ... repair bill (replace the roller) since the printer is out of warranty. According to HP, no 1215 printer can be repaired. Their only option is an exchange. They will send you a new HP 1215 for [price] (retail is [price]) and you return your old one. Apart from a ... coupon this is the ONLY option. Buyer beware."
negative,"BEWARE of ZR45MC Tape loading mechanism!!!!: I bought the ZR45MC camcorder in Sept '02. I have been using it quite regularly. then all of a sudden I cannot load new or old mini DV cassettes. The moment I load a cassette, a message flashes on the screen 'REMOVE TAPE' and beeping sound is generated together with a flashing 'EJECT' message. Next step, I ship this to the Canon Factory service in NJ. They replied with an estimate of $160(on top of the $654 I pad for this!!).Also most importantly when I shipped from the Fedex office in Boston, the Fedex person made a remark that she has been seeing quite a number of the Canon camcorders going to NJ for repairs.To sum, I think this is a racket Canon has devised to rip off customers.So beware when you buy a Canon camcorder, ask the retailer about the tape loading mechanism, and if they have any maintenance plans that will repair it."
positive,"Be the man God designed for you to be: Bill Perkins does it again! This is a very practical book about being a man at war with our culture. His six battles are Fight for your identity, Fight for personal holiness, Fight for your family, Fight through pain, Fight for your friends and Fight for a strong faith. Bill's personal examples and insights will help you fight these battles. Become a mighty man today!<a href=""http://www.millionmightymen.com/"">http://www.millionmightymen.com</a>"
positive,"A Book Everyone Should Read: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was honestly one of the best books I have ever read. I was actually a little shocked at how deeply I loved it and how much I didn't want to put it down. A lot of times books written many years ago have a style to them that makes them a little less enjoyable to read. This didn't have that at all and I actually thought it was a new book just written about the early 1900s time period. The story really flowed nicely.One of the things I think that makes a book great is it's ability to change your perspective. This book really did that for me. In the way I think about money and education. I have a passion now to really succeed through college and get the career I have always wanted and I attribute a lot of that new drive to reading this book.In short, this book is an excellent choice when looking for a good read. It is now one of my favorite books of all time."
negative,"The book shows a bleak vision of the future of the world: The book although very confusing , as the author uses too much detail , was intruiging . One of the things that didn't make sense was the reason for the character of clarisse mclellan's dissapearance. The ending of the book is too sudden , as if he rushed to complete the book ."
negative,"SUCKS.: The only reason I purchased this movie was because I heard Jenifer Jason Leigh was nude in it. I read some of the reviews for this before buying it and it sounded half way decent. But after watching it I came to realize that whoever wrote most of those reviews had to be huge Rutger Hauer fans because this movie sucks. The acting sucks, the direction sucks, the writing sucks. The only good content is Jenifer Jason Leigh's nude scenes, and there are quite a few. This is a great movie to watch on mute."
negative,"Rocket Man Where Are You........?: Elton John had peaked as a songwriter in the mid 70's and was even able to tweak out a decent hit every now and then throughout the 80's and early 90's. Today, Elton John's music has become about as exciting to listen to as a trip to the shopping mall. His songwriting has become so formulistic and predictable that you can see him doing the Lion King Part X in about 20 years in a full blown Vegas style show. Elton is a legend whose status is much owed to the music he created more than 20 years ago. Today, it seems comical that this legend has become a comical parody of the ""I think I can still write a hit"" composer who seems to have an endless supply of the same 'adult(now Diseny)-contemporary' melodies with variations on a theme of schmaltz."
negative,Leaks!: Big mistake buying these diapers. Baby dry technology does not work apparently - got several leaks. Will get Dry Max next time.
negative,"disappointed: i have not read other sontag works and was really looking forward to this novel by way of introduction. however, other than the highly creative and stunning ""chapter zero"" there was little to this book. the storyline seemed boring if not trite, and i did not find the writing style particularly interesting either. maryna had my attention off and on, but she and many of the other characters seemed flat to me, alternating between not-quite-alive to over-alive. short of RAVE reviews for some other piece of writing by her, i won't be sampling her other works any time soon."
negative,"Poor craftsmanship: I only had this TV for 8 months, when the picture went on me. I had spent the extra $300 to have in home service, but it was too broke to be repaired in home. It took the repair shop THREE weeks to fix it. Besides the fact that I only had the TV for 7 months, according to the nameplate data it was only 9 months old."
negative,Ever see 3 minutes of the real thing?: It would make you forget this 2007 reinterpretation so fast your head would spin. Movie does NOT catch the flavor of the 60s at all. Or ANY of the charisma of the original. Totally different. You now know less than when you started.
positive,"great acting: Very good film with a great cast. Reese and Wahlberg are wonderful in their roles and play them to perfection, Walhberg especially. Very much worth watching/owning."
positive,"WOW ! !: I actually got to enjoy listening to Rebecca in person last month. She is a joy to hear. For being so young she certainly has a presence about her. Even my husband - who isn't necessarily ""into"" Celtic type music truly enjoyed the concert. I purchased her CD at the concert which she graciously signed for me. It is wonderful! ! Something that I will be listening to for a long time to come. I will also be looking forward to her next CD to see how she has grown with her music. I hope that people will give her Cd a try. She truly shines as an artist."
negative,"Very Penetrating: Rumor has it that Cinnamon Moonpie (better known as C-Murder) had wanted to title his CD ""Trapped in a Man's Ass"", but his handlers warned that it might dampen sales. They also forced him to change some of the more explicitly homoerotic lyrics into more standard gangsta bling-bling tropes. Personally, I think the original concept would have been a refreshing change of pace. I've been waiting for a long time for a rapper with the guts to admit he's not afraid to love another man in the most intimately physical way. We've known for years about CM's tastes and proclivities, but the hypocrisy of the music biz forces gay rappers to hide their true nature beneath transparent macho posturing, lest they alienate their more dimwitted, less progressive fans. But if you read between the lines, it's pretty clear what they're really on about.Say it loud, say it proud, my beautiful gay black brothers!"
negative,"Worst Toy Ever = Batman Animated Batcave: Do not buy this toy. If you are given this toy as a gift, return it for store credit. This is a flimsly and poorly designed stack of platic and paper. The secret door doesn't work, the elevator doesn't slide and toys get stuck in there. The suggested 10"" batman doesn't work with the zip line, bungee or even the elevator. The add says ""Using new adhesive technology, you can set up the Batcave on just about any wall"" so they want us to glue this thing on to a wall.Please don't buy this toy."
positive,suspensful page-turner: Be prepared to keep reading until it's over! Du Maurier is the best at this genre.
negative,Not impressed: I bought this for my son who is obsessed with flash lights and we are constantly going through batteries. I got this thinking it would be an easy battery free way to keep him happy. Boy was I wrong! I have to shake it with all my strength for about 10 minutes to get 2-3 minutes of light out of it. Thank goodness it was cheap cause even so it was a waste of money!
positive,For Dilbert fans and Government Workers: Anyone who has ever lived in a cubicle needs to see this movie... just not when the boss is around! It is funny and painfully close to cubicle truths. Like a live action Dibert cartoon... bureaucracy victims will be rolling on the floor in laughter.
positive,"Suffer no more: Arthur Michele was the kind of doctor who could and did save people's lives, including mine. Twenty years ago, when I first saw him, I had been out of work for six months and was in constant excruciating pain. (Childbirth years later, was by comparison a piece of cake.) His examination was a revelation, and so were his treatments--an intensive therapy program that restored my health and for 20 years has prevented a recurrence.Back pain produced by the muscular-skeletal imbalances that Dr. Michele addresses here are threatening only to quality of life. But as sufferers know too well, what is the value of life if one can barely walk, sit or stand? It is surprising that very few doctors, even today, are familiar with Dr. Michele's revolutionary thinking. Fortunately, those in pain can still benefit from his wisdom --- by finding and buying this book. It works. Take if from one who has been there.--- Alyssa A. Lappen"
positive,"Desmond's creative period: Paul Desmond is well known and broadly admired for his bell-like sound (tone), but this set of recordings well demonstrates the inventive quality of his earlier sesions. His interaction with Mulligan in this piano-free quartet environment brings out the chromatics that might be missed in the Brubeck era recordings. Among his really best."
positive,"Enjoyable: Gerald and Hyacinth appeared to have a perfect marriage, blessed with two beautiful children. However, when cracks appeared (or were the cracks there all along?), there was no stopping the swift breakdown of the marriage and the bitterness that came with it. Gerald had the upper hand in the divorce as he successfully blackmailed Hyacinth into letting him have the custody of both children. Pressured by Gerald, but unable to divulge the secret behind his blackmail to anyone, only when the mystery surrounding the fateful night was solved would Hyacinth be able to get on with her life.The plot was gripping. However, the impressive part was the way the emotional aspects in the book was handled. The sweetness of being in love, the tension between mother and daughter, the bitterness of a marriage breakdown, the pressure and burden of keeping a terrible secret, and the pain of losing loved ones were well-explored. Subtle, but intense at the same time."
positive,"Julie and Julia: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Julie's voice is clear and her message of her life opening up by taking on a daunting, but exhilarating task - and thereby, gaining joie de vivre - is delightful!"
negative,"jjo3's review of dark side of the moog 7: we were at a local cd/bookstore. i purchased omicron's 'generation and motion of a pulse' and my friend got 'dark side of the moog 7' . earlier that day, we were at a garage sale looking at a jacket. i expressed how much it suc_s when you buy some clothing and know a few days later that you probably arent gonna wear again. she exclaimed it suc_s harder when you buy a cd you dont like. this is what happened when we bought dsotm7. it was very depressing. we felt like we had to give it a cance, but i had to turn off the car stereo and express to her how bad i felt. she felt the same, as did our friend in the back seat. it was a complete drag. especially for teh $ paid."
positive,"Nearly Sanders Best: It took a while to get into this cd. Though I often admire Bill Laswell, sessions that he produces are often terribly uneven (except Sharrock's Ask the Ages where he basically lets the music do the talking). The title track starts with an ""ambient"" percussion section that makes you want to say ""laswell is a genius."" This is followed by an ""afro-pop"" song/rap that makes you want to say ""why does Laswell have to mess with everything."" The problem today is, everybody thinks you have to fill up a whole CD with music. Try programing this disc without the ""smooth jazz"" Midnight in berkely and the title track and I believe you will find this could have been Pharoah's best album and it still clocks in at about 50 minutes."
positive,"Reporting World War II, Part Two: My wife is the reader and she dearly loved this book. So down to earth and factual."
negative,"No so good battery life....dear!!!!!!: Hey,This product has excellent voice quality, but battery life....simply sucksssssssssssss.......so be carefull while buying,...I goona buy new one too./.."
negative,"Plastic pulley, not metal.: The pulley is plastic, not metal as pictured. I've added a photo to show the actual item that I received. The tensioner was made in Canada, according to the label on the box. The plastic pulley might be reliable, but I purchased this item based on the image showing a metal pulley."
positive,"Right before Xmas!! :): Item arrived quickly. Well packaged, and even if it showed as an ""used item"", the DVD it is actually fingerprintless! and looks brand new! 5 star transaction!"
positive,"Love It!: I love my boppy pillow! After reading how many moms loved it, it bought one before my son, Landon, was born. It works wonders for breastfeeding and it is so comfortable to use. I would encourage all moms to get one!"
negative,"Rusted very quickly: Didn't keep in my tank for long, as the bottom started to rust. Wasn't going to chance leaving any part of this plant in a tank with my beloved Betta."
negative,"Worst racing game ever?: This game is incredibly bad. I really can't stress that enough. It has aspirations of being fantastic and some of the obvious ideas expressed in it are great, but to say that they fail in meeting their goal would be a vast understatement. The game is virutally unplayable out of the box and requires you to download at least three (thus far) giant patches that still don't fix everything. I have a high-end computer that more than doubles the recommended requirements of this game and it still runs terribly. At the price, it's still a horrible investment."
negative,"Second rate Faulker: This novel doesn't rank with Faulkner's classic work and there are dozens of reviews here that tell why--but the most basic problem is the difficulty of writing a mystery, a plot-driven story, in prose that is often gibberish."
positive,"Review of The Phoenix Effect: With years of experience, Pate and Platt help the senior manager navigate the rough waters of restructuring, renegotiations and mergers. With case studies from some of the most recognizable names in industry, your company cannot afford to do without these vital strategies on corporate renewal and revitalization."
negative,"leaks bad, missing seals! Twice!: Was so excited to get these..ordered a pair, fit great, but RIGHT foot leaked, because it was missing the seal, returned to get another with the other shoe leaking this time...also, cheap plastic, pain in the but to fill, and it barely holds one shot.....cool -but bad design"
positive,Helper springs for pick up: The springs were delivered on time and fit perfectly. We were very happy to find them. Not and easy thing to find for an old pick-up.
negative,"SweetNSassy: I bought this books strictly for research. Just another tired old how ""hump 'em and dump 'em"" book. The author seems to have a deep rooted hatred and fear of women, tho he claims to love them. He imagines that we have all sort of elaborate games complete with point systems that we use with men, but his whole book is all playing games with women & about knocking hot women down a peg or two. For every ""sucess"" story he tells (a tale of how he got some ""hot"" women to take her panties off for him in 5 miniutes) there are probobly 50 stories of women telling him to take a hike and laughing in his face at his foolish, cheezy, pick up games."
negative,Incredible book. Kindle edition has LOTS of typos: I have read many of Lewis' books and this one outdoes the power of Perelandra. other reviews will give you some of that flavor. The content is five stars; the Kindle edition is so sloppily done that it goes past a mere annoyance to sometimes interfering with what CSL was communicating. Needs a proofreader and a re-release available free to previous purchasers (like me).
negative,dirty dancing: i was disappointed ... i wanted widescreen presentation... i got full screen... very very angry of you.... the box said widescreen movie.. the best way to see any movie... i love this movie ..
negative,"ok, but so far off: the movie was good but it was so far from the book it wasnt funny. anne and gilbert get married just before gilbert goes off to WWI. when he goes missing anne joins the red cross to find him. in the book it is anne's sons that go to war not them. the movie also portrayed anne's best friend, diana, marriage to be on the rocks. in the books diana and fred's marriage was perfectly happy. i also thought that the actors were too old for the ages they were supposed to be. this movie should have been filmed right after the last movie. it would have been better, esp. if they would have stuck to the book."
negative,"Billy is good, Tracy NOT: This tape is 2 workouts by 2 different people. First is Billy, who mostly does upper body work with handweights. He keeps mentioning to keep the stomach muscles tight throughout the workout, which I liked. His workout was easy to follow and do on a rug. The 2nd workout with Tracy is awful. I gave up trying to follow it. Forget about doing this on a rug because she includes slides & crossovers so you have to pivot your feet. The camera focuses on her upper torso so you miss the change in movements. I'll definitely buy another Billy tape, but will avoid anything with Tracy."
positive,Unavoidable: Can any-one like Mahler and not fall under the magic of Abado. The stunning combination of a great conductor and an iconic orchestra the Berliner Philharmoniker.
negative,"1*2*3* Rent, Don't Buy This Canker-Blossom: 1 Star for the DVD, 2 for the director, 3 for the cast: I originally saw this for a Shakespeare in film class at U.C. Berkeley 20 years ago, and it's a ashamed that copy wasn't borrowed for this transfer. But even a clean copy wouldn't help this poorly edited ""art"" film. Hall was definitely trying to aspire to arty French and Italian films of the time, but it doesn't work. As for the acting, the women are great - the men cardboard. Helen Mirren's first major film role as Hermia is fun to watch as is Diana Rigg's Helena. It's also pretty fun to see a 35-year-old Judi Dench as the bare-breasted Titania. Ian Holm is way over the top as Puck and a future playing villians is apparent when you see David Warner's attempt as the fair hero and lover. Mirren's second romp in the forest as Titania in the 1981 BBC production is far superior. Buy that one, then rent this to compare the two for fun."
positive,"The best programming book I've ever read: I've struggled with a lot of mumbling-jumbling programming books and wondered why programming book can be so boring and difficult. Only after reading this book, I understand a lot of authors either don't know what they are talking about or don't really make an effort to make their books useful. Mr. Linden knows exactly what he talks about and make it as simple as possible to understand. Einstein used to say that everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler. Mr. Linden has achieved that. If there were an award for writing good programming book, he certainly deserves one. Thank you Mr. Linden for writing such an excellent book."
negative,Frida's more attractive soundtrack sister: Utterly amazing and unique sound. Her voice is so powerful.
negative,"Avoid if you want ANY extra features.: First, I really enjoyed the movie. Like the other two films, this was a lot of fun to watch because you can disengage and simply enjoy the action.The bad news is that if you care anything about extra features, this is not the release for you. A blu-ray like this is completely unacceptable and is truly a money grab. Wait for the next release which is suppose to come out later this year. From now on I'll pay more attention to the release notes. I haven't bought anything like this in quite some time."
positive,"Piece of cake: It was very easy to replace my old 20Gb HDD with a new 120Gb drive.For those of you who are not wireheads, let me suggest a couple of things before you buy anything:1) Make sure you know what kind of hard drive you need to buy to replace the existing drive (e.g., SATA vs. EIDE, physical dimensions). It wouldn't hurt to look up the specs of the existing hard drive on the manufacturer's website so as to buy a compatible HDD.2) Make sure you have your laptop manufacturer's instructions for replacing the hard drive in hand.Good luck."
positive,Early learning toy: My ten month old got this as a gift and loves it! Many pop up toys are difficult for very young children to use. The buttons on this toy are easy to push and knobs easy to turn. He was frustrated by his other pop up toy that he could rarely get to work with his tiny hands. This allows his cognitive abilities to develop even before his fine motor skills would be ready to use other toys.
negative,"Patrick Stewart and the 7 Dwarfs: Boy, what a lousy Moby Dick! Patrick Stewart is terrific. That is it, period. The effects with the whale are fine, but when the cabin boy is drowning, the water is only up to his chest. When will the REAL Moby Dick be on DVD? Now that the Coen Brothers have paid tribute with the ending of ""Oh Brother"", one can get one's hopes up again. Save your money for that."
positive,"Great concert recordings..: I went to see this tour when Pete came to Birmingham in 1993 and I was blown away. This record is good stuff - the recordings sound great, ""Sledgehammer"" has got more life here than ever and ""In your eyes"" is AWESOME and much longer than its original. It's a shame there's no ""Biko"" or ""Shock the monkey"" (which Peter actually played when I saw him), but the best thing about this album is the tracks off ""Us"" sounds tons better!! ""Secret world"" being the best, ""Come talk to me"" sounding great also (cool drumming from Manu Katche). I give this album 4.5 stars - better song selection would have been 5."
positive,"A Fantastic Read: Erin Hunter is one of the most promising animal writers I've come across in a long time. Warriors #1, Into the Wild, follows the story of a house-cat, Rusty, who is drawn into the forest and the tradition-bound cat clans who live within. Starting out as an apprentice and gaining both friends and enemies, Rusty - remaned `Firepaw' by his clan - sets out to prove that cats of `kittypet' origin can survive just as well in the wild as forest-born cats. Very engaging to read, the sort of story that packs as much action as it can between the pages. Erin has done a fantastic job creating the world of her cats, with a partial language, traditions, histories, and definite way of life for them. A gripping tale and an excellent introduction into the feline world for older and younger readers."
positive,"Arginine, the truth: I initially bought it to add some wow factor to an no2 supplement i was taking, but when i used them both i was overwhelmed and jittery. I thought maybe the arginine made the no2 supplement work better, but not at all. The arginine was doing most of the work and giving me a mega pump. The no2 supplement was that cost a bout 4 times as much....Tsk tsk tsk."
positive,"The scarlet Letter: The book was wonderful and in good condition. I purchased it for my daughter, who is in highschool. The book arrived around the time it stated it would. Above all of that the price was great."
positive,"Quality diaper!: We've tried close to every brand of diaper available - even store brands. We've had a lot of success with Pampers diapers. Our daughter is tall for her age and has a longer torso. With some diapers it is difficult to find one that fits high enough, preventing leaks. These seem to fit her well, no leaks! Also, for as thin as they are, they seem to be very aborbent.We had been using Costco's Kirkland brand diapers because they were a good value diaper, and were not unhappy with them. However, after I enrolled in the 'Amazon Mom' program, I am able to get these diapers shipped to my door on the schedule I choose, free shipping, for less than I was able to buy the same quantity of Costco's brand. Impressive! We're able to get a quality, brand-name diaper at a big-box-store price.Since enrolling in the program, we have switched back to Pampers and are very pleased!"
negative,"uhhh yuk!: I love techno and have listened to it since it's onset in 1989 or 1990. This CD, however, has not aged well. In 1992 when this was released I tolerated it because there weren't many techno artists or CDs out there. Now I see that this CD is simply tiresome, crass garbage. Samples of Annie Lennox and Kate Bush are overused and abused and the only reason this drivel was played on the radio or in any club. I think this CD has been stuck under the backseat of my Volvo 244 since 1993. And it probably has gunk on it."
positive,"Where Did Clay Go ?: Well I bought the record. I have been for Clay all the time but the record is not for playing a second time, and not because of Clays voice, but the material used. Where did the belting of the songs go, and the class of his defining of the song?I wish I could do an album and direct the music.He has a voice to be heard by all the world,as an ageless voice sings.He appeals to the hip and the hop and drop(oldsters), but please give us an album with his beautiful voice, and also ,I miss that smile at the end of his songs I wonder when he sang these songs if he had the smileat the end of the song.I am 67 and have wrote a review before but I am young at heart but the old songs and melodies of Elton, Sinatra, Johnny Mathis and Neil Diamond give us something to rememberlets try some of these on Clay ok,love you Clay ty for listening to me."
negative,"From Jean Auel?: I think not. It's not a book, it only looks like one.What a disappointment.Truly hope Ms. Auel reads some of the reader reviews here.(I did read all her previous works and really looked forward for this one - duhhh)"
negative,"lackluster and lazy: This season of he L word is probably the worst written season thus far. The story arc is disjointed, the individual character storylines appear to not have anything to do with the previous season's story arc and the camera work is pedantic. The music which was a standout element in season one and two is equally lackluster.If you are a fan of the show save your money, and if you are a new to the show invest in season one or two."
positive,"Classic Detective: I remember reading Rex Stout in High School and not really getting the humour. I'm so glad I read this again. This is really a classic detective story, a good plot and no obvious murderer. 12 years on and the odd bits of humour, Archie's obvious confusion on what Nero Wolfe is planning and the great mysterious Nero Wolfe is very enjoyable."
negative,"A triumph of marketing over film making.: This film is very, very silly. Fair enough if the viewer wishes to see a film that has not even a tenuous link to reality. Poorly made, poor attention to detail (real life representation) and sloppy continuity that is inexcusable in a movie of this budget.My advice to those that go gooey at the mention of Swayze and Reaves..... Do your self a favour and buy a poster, and watch that for a couple of hours instead."
positive,"Perfect Christmas Present - Keurig B70: Purchased as a Christmas gift for my husband who has a tendency to drink 3-day old coffee re-heated in the microwave. He (and the rest of us tea and cocoa drinkers) absolutely love it. It's quick, easy, always fresh and easy to operate. Coffee choices are excellent. Cocoa isn't as easy to find now that winter is nearly over. If you're a 1-2 cup a day coffee drinker, this is an excellent choice."
positive,"Not Your Average Punk Band: Mest may just seem like another one of the power punk groups that have come about in the last couple years, but they really have their own style that they bring which helps set them apart from other bands of this nature. The catchy pop-punk 4-some has released a new album ""Destination Unknown"". This is the southside Chicago punkers 3rd album. The variations of melodic punk songs makes the albums so significant. With their first single ""Cadillac"", rawked the air ways in philly and all over the u.s. The album includes singles such as ""Cadillac"" and ""Mother's Prayer"". Out of 5 Stars, The album is a over all 4 out of 5."
positive,"Great Movie: I teach Corporate Finance, and it is a better lesson than Wall Street - a lot funnier too!"
negative,"Andy should stick to his great columns!: I love Andy Borowitz' humor in ""The Borowitz Report"", and always read it. This slim book just doesn't have much substance, however. It should have just been used for a couple of ""Reports""."
positive,"Perfect gift for my 9 year old niece: After struggling to find a gift she would enjoy that would also provide a little educational content, I'm happy that I wound up choosing the Global Puzzle. It was a good challenge for her, but not so difficult that she got frustrated or bored and gave up. I would gladly recommend this product to others with children in this age range."
positive,Fantastic: this sharpener is smooth and reliable. does not bind up or break the tips of the pincils. i have one on my desk at work and one at home. this is a fantastic shapener.
positive,awesome movie: This is a great addition to any DVD collection. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who likes this TV series.
negative,"Good special effects, lame otherwise: The special effects are the only thing that saved this movie. The characters are shallow, the plot is either non-existant or predictable, and the ending is unbelievable. If you're interested in this movie, I would recommend the 1963 version instead. It doesn't rely so heavily on special effects and in turn has great characterization and plot (not to mention a more believable setting). The DVD takes longer than usual to cue up or didn't work at all in both my players. (I tried two different discs, same problem.)"
positive,"You will not be able to get these songs out of your head!: It's a hit. This is definitely Unwritten Laws best album yet. Every song tells a story that you can relate to on some level and that's what makes it cool to listen to. Yes it's catchy and accessible, and at the same time it's the heaviest album they've created so far (the drums and bass are very metal), and that's exactly why it's so rad. Pick up this record you will be stoked."
positive,"Handy and eloquent: I am really pleased with this Bible. The translation is great for personal study and the size is great to be carried in your pocket everywhere so you can read it as you walk or look up anything as it iterests during the day. The binding is holding well and shows no signs of wear. The leather cover is great as it has already saved it from some moisture, and it has a great smooth feel. The type is a bit small than other translations I have seen, but that isn't a problem. The ribbon page marker is designed well as it already has the crease in the top so it easily marks the page without haveing to work to get it so there is no crease in it in the middle to cause extra strain on the binding (a highlight I think). As all ESV Bibles, this has an eloquent touch on the font of the book titles and its presentation."
negative,Wrong cables: They didn't send me 3.5mm Stereo Male To 2 RCA Male Cable 5 ft. I got 3.5mm Stereo Plug to 3.5mm Stereo Plug 12ft.
negative,"Hold on a minute: Add these ingredients:Flashy music, beautiful ladies, sexy dance moves, scanty clothes (no nudity), beautiful landscapes, and even some seaside hobbies... and what do you get?Wait a minute...Now add a film editor who thinks his amateurish effects are more important than the above ingredients. All the above scenes of the hobbies, the ladies, the landscapes were all spliced and edited into each other for a ""strobe"" effect of split second images so that you can't focus on any of it.Now what do you have?Probably a yard sale item in the 10 for a dollar bin. I may buy some of the earlier volumes to see if they're the same... wish me luck."
negative,"Shallow and inacurate misrepresentations and interpretations: I'm sorry but referencing Rumi? I don't think you ever even read it. Judging from the interpretation that this silly Aesop fable has anything at all to do with of - The Mouse and The Frog, Rumi's Mathnawi , the author completely misses the point and takes a very lazy view of the meaning of this great poetic work. The Mouse and The Frog is a powerful LOVE STORY not a tale of ~revenge presented by this author. READ THE ORIGINALS YOURSELVES, PEOPLE!"
positive,"Great fit: These inserts fit well, and once you obtain the necessary software, are easy to design. The manufacturers website has the design software available as a free download, however even with a cable connection, I was unable to download. They sent me a cd of the software for free, however I was disappointed to have to wait the extra time for the software to arrive.Overall, I am pleased with the product."
positive,"They don't make movies like this anymore: This movie is basically the opposite of the polished epics Scorsese is making today. I actually like this better than his latter gangster epic Casino, but not as much as I like Goodfellas. Some truly amazing sequences with unforgettable characters are set to the wonderful pop/rock soundtrack. Check it out; Scorsese and DeNiro don't make films like this anymore and may never again (though The Departed was a nice return to form for Scorsese).Ivan Rorick"
negative,"(...): (...)DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.It's a lousy piece of hardware. I gave it away and bought a Linksys router that actually worked as advertised.The Belkin tech support guy actually told me to ""call Microsoft because their having a lot of problems with their browser"". True story."
negative,"of mice and men: The story is about two gays that are looking for any job. All that time while they are looking for a place also to stay, they pass trough lots of bad and good things. They always help and got each other,""I got you, you got me""said George, one of the principal characters, and this shows de people who read this book, that when you have a friend that is passing a bad moment, you have to support him , and that is a good example for children. Also, the main theme of the story is loneliness, this also help people to trie to get lots of friends, for not being alon ein the future. Story statement by Jhon Steinbeck, is a very interesting book for all ages, who wants two know about two gays that pass unforgetable moments and that one of the two lives will end in the ranch, where they finally lived and work."
negative,"There's much better available: I was very disappointed in this book -- it's one of the few I've bought from Amazon based on reviews alone. Compared to herbal/nutrition books like The Green Pharmacy, Scientific Validation of Medicinal Herbs, and energy work/body work books like Touch for Health, I found this a mish-mash of information.I did not like the way in which the references (where there were any) to research were handled, the indexing is poor and information is hard to find, and the illustrations are extraordinarily ugly and amateurish.I'm very interested in muscle testing, so I'll look further."
negative,"an out of towner's attempt to depict NY: A poor disjointed sketch of New York.This book came to me with great recommendation.Terrible disappointment.Characters not developed fully but left up in midair.Lots of cliches.Describes Bronx like an out of towner from Utah or somewhere,typical white reaction to black abodes.If police story is what you want, read Joseph Wambaugh.Honest stories, not grandiose cocktails of Bond Millionaires and Attornies.For cynicism and society parties, watch Woody Allen.No one person ,not even Tom Wolf can sketch a true picture of New York.He has seen the tail of the elephant,the other blind men have seen the rest.New york is too big for writers to do justice."
positive,Very well done and packaged.: Very well done. Packageing and shipment was beyond expectation. Watch it with my grandkids and they really enjoyed it as myself and my wife.
positive,"Wow: In The Heart of The Sea won the National Book Award for a reason. Philbrick's attention to detail, his research, and his style all make this incredibly tragic story come alive in a very fresh way. There were moments when I felt driven to tears, moments when I was completely disgusted, and moments when I couldn't help but laugh. This book is good for anyone interested in whaling, the ocean, survival stories, or just an amazing read."
negative,"pinches fingers: My son got this last year for his fourth birthday. He only played it a few times when it slammed down and somehow pinched his fingers hard enough to make him cry. He never wanted to play the game again, I ended up getting rid of it. There are too many other fun and safe games out there to bother with this one."
negative,Cheap Cheap CHEAP: This thing was NOTHING like what I expected. The foam padding on the inside makes the PLASTIC helmet sit so high on your head that it really protects nothing. I sent mine back.
positive,"One of the best Disney movies!!: Classic story, great humor, great feelingIt was one of my favorite growing up and nothing has changed as I got older."
positive,Tomorrow Will Be Better: A True Story of Love and One Family's Triumph over the Horrors of World War II: Excellent and well-written book. Recommended reading for young adults and older. We must all remember what atrocities were committed in Europe and other countries. It is a testament to the human spirit and the capacity to survive terrible circumstances. This book will become a permanent part of our family's library.
negative,Antenna not as ordered: I read the reviews and everyone had received the 1000 instead of theordered 1500 and I thought surely that problem had been fixed by now.Bad guess----I received my 1000 instead of the ordered 1500 today 17 Jan.So it seems that Amazon is making no effort to correct the problem. Itdidn't even matter that the shipping order indicated a 1500 and the ordera 1000 was shipped. Don't know yet what to do with it as others havereceived the wrong item more than once. This is unlike Amazon.
negative,"These diapers don't do their job.: These diapers have a design flaw. When my baby has a BM, a small amount seeps through the diaper so I put two of these on so her clothes do not get messy."
negative,"bad translation: Please let shoppers know who the translator is. It makes a difference. If you want the classic Stranger, don't buy this edition. This is translated into ""American."""
negative,"Too Stupid: I bought this for my grandson who loves ""cheesy"" movies but even he said this movie was too stupid. The first Killer Tomatoes movie at least had some funny parts. This movie doesn't. Don't waste your money."
negative,"Too Reliant on Coincidence and Contrivance: Originally published in 1961, this rather weak mystery shows its age poorly. The inspector of the title is interesting in how dated he now appears; consistently polite and apologetic in his work, and lord of the manor at home. He is embroiled in what seems like a fairly straightforward murder which turns out to be devilishly confusing--but, alas not that interesting for the reader. Matsumoto switches back and forth between the investigation and a group of young, new intellectuals who are darlings of Tokyo's media. Obviously the twain shall meet, but it's not very satisfying when they do. Matsumoto relies altogether too much on coincidences and unlikely convenient relationships to bring things to a solution. Not a book that will make me seek out others by the author."
negative,"In short, it's special effects trash, nothing more.: I was unlucky enough to have seen this movie in the theaters. I should've waited for it to come out on video. NO! I should've waited for it to premiere on network TV had I known it was going to be this bad. ""The Mummy"" is basically an exercise in special effects, and nothing more. At least they could've included something of a plot, but it was nowhere to be found. People said I should see it merely for the effects, although after seeing it, I didn't think they were any better than ""The Matrix"". I don't care for the acting, either. It's an example of what poor casting can do to a film. Now for my attack on the MPAA, I felt that the level of violence in this film was too much for a PG-13 rating. If you disagree with me, then take a close look at the R rated film ""The Matrix"" and decide for yourself which is worse."
positive,"great pants: i am a nurse and i wear these to work. they are heavy duty without being too warm. the cargo pockets are fantastic for all my ""things"" i need to carry with me. since finding these i have to gone back to silly scrub pants."
positive,"Reagan Service at the National Cathedral: I have not heard the CD, yet. (sorry)But have spent some time this afternoon tracking down info on the piece that was played as Pres Reagan was carried from the National Cathedral.It took a bit of searching to come up with a loose title to the piece and some names. But I am not certain that I have the correct score.Can someone verify that the processional piece at the end of the service was a rendition from this CD? Which track?It almost sounded like two items, one with the words ""the mansions of the Lord"" and a second, more eloquent anthem, that they continued to play in cycle.Thank you"
negative,"Horrible!: I really wanted to like this book. I am a chef who loves cooking memoirs and Julia Child so how could I go wrong? Well I went very wrong, very very very very wrong.The book has nothing to do with cooking, from a woman who seemingly hates food and only started cooking(by her on account) to snag her husband. Why I wonder did the woman choose to do all of the recipes in MTAOFC in 365 instead of truly trying to do the recipes as written and to perfection? I do think as a past reviewer has said that this was Ms. Powell attempt( which she did successfully) to get rich off of the late and great Julia Child.I am not a fan of reading about a very spoiled woman who seems to have no real talent of her own. Complaining about living conditions, family, friends, job, etc. but never seeking to improve them. If you like to read this sort of thing, this is the book for you."
positive,"Measure of a Man: Clay Goes Beyond!Beyond anything you heard on AI, Clay shows his real talent. 'The Way' gave me goosebumps in the same way that his rendition of 'This is the Night' did when I first heard him sing it. Hopefully, he is hear to stay. I love his voice. If you stumble a bit on the first song, keep listening. It is the only one that is tentative in my opinion."
negative,Julia Child Turns Over in Grave!: The premise is good...but the book was terrible. Plus this woman has the mouth of a truckdriver. I'm sure that Julia Child is turning over in her grave.
positive,"I find that Jeff Gold music is exceedingly uplifting!!: I own two CD's by Jeff Gold: ""Escapes"", and ""The Soul of the Mountain"". I find that his music is exceedingly uplifting, and after listening to his music colors seem to brighten and the belief in goodness is restored. (I especially enjoyed his compositions, ""Del Playa"" and ""The Soul of the Mountain"".) J.Gold is a gifted composer by any standard and he is unparalleled when it comes to writing music that has a healing effect on the psyche. I highly recommend Jeff Gold Music to Everyone!"
positive,A Classic Read: Those who enjoyed Lord of the the Rings will like this. It's a classic Tolkien novel that gets better with every reading.
negative,"Looks nice! Except...: I think it should cost around $15, but it was the cheapest tape I could find on the web that was like this. However, DO NOT USE this if this is not a PERMANENT installation. After getting a new projector and expanding my existing screen size, this tape ripped my drywall to shreds. Pulled paint off, made the wall flex... when sanding off the wall, I had to sand down to the bare drywall to get rid of all of the residue. I had to use chemical remover for a couple of days and then patch and sand the wall. I'll never use this product again. If it's permanent or you're putting it on a sheet, then the product is very nice looking, and the adhesive is insanely good."
positive,"Find this book!: My dad introduced me to the work of Thomas Tryon. A few months ago he found a handful of books up in the garage that he'd read when he was in high school, and some of Tryon's novels were among them. I cooked through Harvest Home and was very impressed with with his masterful descriptions and breathtaking plot twists/revelations. Then I read The Other... I was completely blown away. You can't miss this book. It's a masterpiece. It's not frightening in a slasher, better-look-over-your-shoulder-type way, but the concept will chill you, without a doubt. It's such a good story, and it's executed so well... It's the best book I've read in a very long time. I would recommend it to anyone who is the mood for a good, haunting, thought-provoking piece of literature. My hat is off to Thomas Tryon... I can't wait to get my hands on another one of his works."
negative,"First Michael Myers, then Jason, then Freddy now Santa?: I hated this movie! Most of it is from the first one as the brother of the original Santa Claus killer talks about his past(including a memorable cameo by scream queen Linnea Quigley as she's topless throughout her scene as she gets stabbed by some antlers of a deer head on top of a fireplace, which is one of the only good scene's). Then he talks about his deadly obsessive lifestyle. After that he decides to wear the santa suit and goes on a killing spree. Where do the people get the cash to make trashy movies like this?? Trying to borrow seasonal traditions of such slasher films as ""Halloween"",""Friday the 13th"", ""My Bloody Valentine"", and even ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", this movie is the pits and deserves to get burned. Cast features Elizabeth (Cayton) Kaitan, who was more famous for her roles in ""Assault of the Killer Bimbos"" and ""Friday the 13th Part VII: New Blood."""
positive,Her favorite: This is not my favorite book. I don't like the pictures and the flaps are flimsy. But this book has something my daughter loves. She picks it every time. She loves finding Stretch in every picture and is thoroughly entertained by the story. If only I didn't have to suffer through it! We bought it when she was one and she's now two and still wants it read to her.
negative,"Hopeless: Trust me, this film is not worth your time.In the first Robocop the violence was extreme and had a wickedly dark twist to it. Even in the second film there was at least some excellent action sequences. The third film, however, is just Hollywood cashing in on a successful series!The plot is both simple and see through and the characters lack any real depth. Where before RoboCop was a lone ranger style character, who we feel sorry for due to his situation, he is now merely just another comic book hero.A lesson in how to ruin a good action/adventure film concept."
negative,"Not the exceptional quality I expect from Sybex: This book's TOC looks as if it should cover a decent chunk of the objectives, however, once you get into the book, you find that the amount of explanation for individual--and important--subjects is lacking.Also, the questions are poorly written, do not compare in any way with what I'm used to seeing on exams, and sometimes ask about subjects not even covered in the WHOLE BOOK!Lastly, this book is riddled with errors (Author refers to RAID 0+1 as RAID 5+0 by accident in several places, etc). Did anyone edit this thing before press?I'll not buy another one of Govanus' books...."
positive,"Excellent,: When I first started watching this movie I was not impressed. In the beginning it seemed sort of slow, just another typical romantic comedy. However, it got much better and I had to watch again. I'm usually not a fan of Ashley Judd, but this would have to be one of her best movies."
positive,"I love this video!: I have done an exhaustive search trying to find this Baby Goes video again. I used to show it to my kids and my home day care kids 6 years ago and loved it. I've started up day care again and couldn't find it anywhere until a very nice librarian helped me track down the title of it. The videos are cute--about a child's real world, and the songs are very catchy and memorable."
negative,"bad isn't fitting: can not believe I watched the whole movie, I kept hoping it could get better. Never did get any better, only worse"
negative,"horrid DVD: Love the show, which for me has held up well: it's obviously dated but still makes me laugh.What didn't make me laugh, though, was the quality of this DVD. The quality of the transfer, it's as though you're still watching it on VHS! It doesn't support surround-sound, even by just repeating the two channels.There are no subtitles in any language, and no special features of any kind!Worse, mine had scratches right out of the plastic! The scene where Jack comes up to the breakfast table in his speedos is all pixelated. Was that true for anybody else?"
positive,"John Bryan Bulb book: This is an excellent reference book, listing all types of bulbs, from the common garden variety to the more obscure varieties. Listings also include all the hybrids and new cultivars. The book is well set out with many colour photos of the different species. A must for any home library and avid gardeners anywhere."
positive,"Mean dudes carrying on...: A friend loaned me this film, and I thought it would be a bust. It's silly, borderline-stupid, and then...hey, what's going on? I knew the fun would start when Fox mention's her plutonium-laced tampon, not to mention a serum that makes guys horny at all costs. (That tampon saves the day...)A cross between Mission: Impossible, James Bond and Jackie Chan, once I knew it was a parody, I can't remember having more fun.When the big, black, behemoths get friendly with each other, it just becomes a laff riot till the end.Sure, it's no great film, but I just may buy this as a fun guilty pleasure. Parody films are usually more fun than the originals.."
positive,"Great 1st Card Game: My daughter, who will be 4 in 2 weeks, loves this game! Only took a couple of times before she really got it. She loves the wild cards. I take the box in my purse when we go to doctor appts. or the airport to keep her from being bored. We love playing it as a family too."
negative,Great book: worst narrator!: This is indeed one of the best science fiction works produced however I must give it a miserable review on account of the almost criminal selection of narrators! There are a great many text to speech programs available which offer a more enjoyable listening experience! I am no stranger to audiobooks but this one is almost unbearable to listen to on account of the deplorable narration!
positive,"Becoming Jane: Beautiful performances by a highly talented cast. Anne Hathaway renders a loving, intelligent and vibrant portrayal of Jane Austen as a young woman. The story invokes scenes from Austen's novels but avoids the trap of drawing the whole story from them. Jane's parents and sister Cassandra are admirably drawn characters, as is her somber suitor, Mr. Wisley (sp?), who appreciates Jane's true worth and settles for her friendship when he can not gain her heart and hand. Tom LeFroy is not an appealing enough character as written to account for Jane's infatuation - but such is often the case in real life, and James McAvoy gets the most out of the part.The pacing seems a bit off at times, and some of the characterizations are a bit flat, but overall, it is well worth adding to any collection of Jane Austen novels and movies."
positive,"hi-tec mens altitude IV: great boots even works great while walking up wet boards!!! buy this product you will not be sorry, well made and true to size."
positive,"Speedway: Again, I'm writing this review for my husband. He loves all things Elvis. He enjoyed the movie very much."
positive,My Life: Kathleen Cross have you been walking around with a pen & paper writing down my life. I am Nina. My whole life is like that a constant battle. I really love this book. Thank you for a great read. You did an excellent job with the characters and plots. I cannot thank you enough for providing a wonderful read.
positive,Decent for the price: yes the item does come kinda smelly. if you put in the washer/dryer you'll get lint everywhere. tag says dry clean only. i got two blankets. These are good for just sitting on the couch to stay warm.
negative,"Balls are mislabeled - this is actually a 65cm, that's marked as 75: These balls are excellent. I use one at work as a chair and was buying another for exercise at home. Very good product, but my low rating is due to the fact that Amazon apparently received a batch of balls that are mislabeled. I have 65cm Go Fit balls at home and this 75cm is exactly the same size. My 75cm Go Fit that I have at work is noticeably larger.I've returned this ball once and Amazon (as they always do) gave me excellent customer service and sent out a replacement. Regrettably, the replacement is also a 65cm marked as 75cm."
negative,"Print is too small: I have good eyesight, but the print in this book is far too small to be comfortably legible. I should've imagined this would be the case given the price. I plan to buy a different edition because I'd rather have a book I can comfortably read that costs more than a cheaper one I would never read."
positive,"brief overview: This is not a book, its a pamphlet that gives a very terse overview of the PL/I language. Its not a beginners book but a primer for experienced programmers. The only current book on PL/I is ""The New PL/I"" by Eberhard Sturm which is already out of print after being out less than 2 years"
negative,Does not work with TiVo!!: Do not buy this thinking it is a cheaper alternative to the TiVo branded adapter. I have a dual tuner Series 2 with software version 9.3.It would not recognize this unit. Word to the wise.....
positive,...: ... trust me shoppers this is a good game exept the boss at the end is a little too hard but hey what game doesn't have a hard ending boss exept that castlevania game for playstation but it is a good game for kids who like the movies. by the way the graphics are good....
negative,"Piece of Junk: First I am disappointed that Amazon makes you give at least one star. My advise on this sorry excuse for a printer is to save your money...save yourself from more gray hairs...save your kids from having to hear you yell obscenities...and don't buy this piece of junk! Unless you enjoy having to load each sheet of paper one at a time every time you print, all the time in hopes that it will take the paper and not jam. If that sounds like fun - then my friend...this is the printer for you! Me on the other hand, I will never own another HP."
negative,"Teaching Pronunciation: I expected this bookTeaching Pronunciation: A Reference for Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languagesto be more helpful for my needs as a current EFL teacher. However, the text is written more for a college level linquistic class of future ESL/EFL teachers."
positive,"What a Fantastic Film!: I just finished watching this film on cable... Countless tissues later, eyes red, I came right over to Amazon to find it on DVD. It's apparently only on VHS, but I do hope they release it on DVD. This film was beautiful! So well done, a true classic. I'm not one to rant and rave about the usual movie fare, but this film grabs you and keeps you ""right there"" with the characters.... Lady for a Day is a keeper, the perfect movie for a rainy afternoon."
negative,"Not sure for this product: I live in north NJ. I overseeded my front yard with Canada Green Seed in the middle of September. Watered twice a day every day, about a week, it started germinating and within a month, my front yard looked good. HOWEVER, now that spring comes, my front yard is dead again..... This past winter was very mild. I have to do overseeding again. But this time, I use different brand and see what happens. I wasted my money on Canada Green."
positive,Good Value: It's hard for me to find one of these that is'nt made from too heavy of a material and thus too hot when I use it on my bike in the winter. This one was a good weight material. My only complaint was it was a little tight but I think it will strech in time.
positive,"nothing compares to seeing him live baby!: moby takes us by the hand through his incredible journies of exploration in every single aspect of music known. he is a very nice person and he cares about you feeling the music with him. i found this album to do more for me than i expected. ""GO"" for it! ;)"
positive,"This movie makes me iffy about having a boyfriend!: This movie kept me in suspense most of the time. It makes me have second thoughts about having a boyfriend. It is a great movie and if you like sitting on the edge of your seat the whole time, this is the movie for you."
negative,"movie doesn't play: The packaging was terrific. The movie appeared in good shape, new looking. When I put the movie into the DVD player, an error appeared in my top left corner of my television screen. The movie does NOT work at all. This truely saddens me due to the fact that I have wanted to watch this movie since I watched it when it first came out!!!"
negative,"The message is good but...: The message of this book is that you always need books, no matter if you have internet, TV or whatever, you always will need a book, this message is written in a book of almost 200 pages, so if someone that doesn't like to read reads this book that person will never read again no matter the message, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget that story, maybe the only book who needs to be burnt is this one."
positive,This rich story kept me involved from cover to cover!: This is certainly a world classic! Wonderful descriptions of the times and exotic locales! The movies and mini-series do not do this novel justice!
positive,Heart is awesome!!: I absolutely adore Heart and hadn't heard this album in years! I actually purchased it for my mom and it hasn't left her CD player since.
positive,Gets the job done right!: I have two long haired cats and these are by far my favorite lint rollers--super sticky and gets the job done in record time.
positive,"Love Oriah: The Call parallels Oriah's other works in quality, depth and meaning. It will be a book I read, underline and keep on the bookshelf for future reference. I believe that the content has meaning which becomes more useful at different points in ones life."
negative,"One of the worst things ever... and not just on DVD: This movie was truly painful to watch. There is not enough space in this review to list all of the things wrong with this movie. But I will try.First of all... Some actors have British accents, others French, and the lead has an American accent. Yet others have migratory accents that wander between these three. Much of the dialogue has obviously been dubbed in after, and it sounds like it. Also, exposition is painfully squeezed into every stilted, dubbed-over line. The characters are so cartoonish and unbelievable that you will be cheering for D'Artagnan's death by the end. .....The only reason I bothered to see this movie was for the choreographed fight scenes that looked cool in the commercial. Unfortunately, they are short, poorly filmed, and badly edited. ...."
positive,"digital caliper: For years I have been using a mechanicl caliper, but the numbers were starting to wear and getting hard to read. With this digital calipeer there is no problem with trying to reead the numbers. Should have bought it years ago."
positive,"This book is like a gently flowing stream: I think each part of the story doesn't effect me a lot, but after reading the whole story, they combined all together to make me feel something strong inside of my mind. I think it is a very sensitive story."
negative,"More Hash, Less Rehash: This album is lifeless and trite and all the more so when compared to the rest of the albums in his catalog. The hype surrounding this album smacks of the same fawning attempts to honor Dylan now that he has entered his washed-up phase. Like so many other reviewers have stated, buy the old stuff instead, its grittier, more powerful and more substantial-everything that Prairie Wind is not."
positive,"NOIR AT IT'S DARKEST: Come on, it doesn't get cooler than 'Detour'! No budget, no stars, and a wacked-out story of hellish bad luck. Tom Neal is what passes for our hero, a pianist en route to the coast to meet up with his girl when 'fate sticks out a foot to trip him'. It's really amazing to see how great this thing turned out considering how little it had going for it. Watch it at like 3 a.m., when everything is a little foggy, and you'll appreciate it even more. Then, watch 'D.O.A.', and 'He Walked By Night'."
positive,"A Modern Day Fairy Tale Classic: One of my absolute favorites, this gem of a film is a comedy, a drama, a romance and a fantasy film all rolled into one. Combined with the twisted & irreverent filmmaking style of Terry Gilliam (""12 Monkeys"" and ""Time Bandits"") this film is not for everyone, but for those who like something different and maybe even a little magical, you can't go wrong with this one. Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges are two men from two different worlds, but both lost and in pain. Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer are the women in their lives. When circumstanes bring them together, they are able to save one another. A sadly overlooked film filled with wonderment and, in the end, joy."
positive,"Every woman should buy this book!: Ever since my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer I have read almost anything I can get my hands on regarding this dreadful disease. This book is by far the most outstanding I have read. I wish I had looked here first. Joseph Keon's 7-step plan is remarkable and so very easy to read. I've read it from cover to cover 3 or 4 times and have tried almost all of the recipes he suggests. They are just fantastic. I've watched my weight and exercised regularly most of my life....now I feel that, with his help, I'm on the right track with nutrition, too. If only we all would follow his advice, maybe there would be less people having to deal with breast cancer. I highly recommend reading this book."
negative,"Great title. Poor book.: It's intriguing: The scriptures that have come down to us really aren't accurate and maybe we should rethink what being a Christian really means. However, this book uses little substantiation for its assertions, preferring, evidently, to be controversial rather than thoughtful. If you really have questions about the ""holy"" bible, please read Bart D. Ehrman's MISQUOTING JESUS. The author's creditials are REAL, his proofs are relatively clear, and his message is more useable: The bible is a human document that has application in our lives. My advice: Continue to be a seeker of Truth...but don't bother buying this book."
negative,Famous Rat Pack Movies: Judd and Little Moon was an incredibly bad movies with the poorest acting I have seen.The Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis movie was marginally better
negative,"Useless that text to speech is not enabled!: Hi!I guess I didn't look too carefully and missed that text to speech was not enabled.Is there a way to get the publisher to change their mind?Thanks,per"
negative,"Do you want some whine with your meal?: At first when I saw some negative reviews for this book I thought it was just sour grapss. Wouldn't every blogger want their brilliant ramblings transformed into a book?I love food memoirs, and this one has such an intriguing premise. But I found the writing flat, and there seems to be so much griping and whining about her husband, parents, friends, and the loft where she lives (which is constantly and annoyingly put into quotations, as ""the loft.""The narrative rambles, gasps, and coughs. After about 120 page this just went nowhere for me and it was too painful and boring to pick the book up again after setting it down. I give up."
positive,"Damn: I really enjoyed them from the time I turned them on and figured out how to use them. Then I made use of the headset outlet and pluged in my Altec Lansing Computer speakers, Damn unbeleivable. I plan to spend alot of time hitting on them and would like to find out if Yamaha has got any accessories for it. I Travel alot and spend anywhere from a week to 2 months in Lancaster California. That can be a long time away from beating on something. Thanks Yamaha, I now have another piece of Luggage to pack for my trips."
negative,"Uh, well...: Really mediocre romantic comedy featuring a brown-haired Helen Hunt before Mad About You and As Good As It Gets, Kelly Preston before her career surge, and Andrew McCarthy on the downside of his Brat Pack run. Shows up occasionally on cable, and best left there."
positive,"Absolutely Fascinating: This book sat unread on my shelves for a while, and now I can't believe it didn't actually leap off the shelf into my hands to MAKE me read it; it's so utterly fascinating and engrossing that I haven't been able to put it down. I was expecting some dry history and feminism; this is a fascinating first-person portrait (or rather, five first-person portraits) of political struggle, social norms, everyday life, and revolution from the writings of five very literate, engaging writer/revolutionaries.I hardly know how to review a book like this (since I can't talk about plot or about structure of arguments, as it's first-person memoirs), but it's been among the most worthwhile 250 pages of my reading life."
negative,"Horrible: Fifa has always been horrible and this game is no different. The only reason I can see someone wanting to play this game is because it has the official licenses to most of the club teams. Other than that, it's just a waste of $40."
negative,"Great book but now out of date: I've noticed the rave reviews (some very recent) below don't take note of how the book was written in 1995 and is now discredited. (No discredit to Kaku personally, of course.) The various 10-Dimensional superstring theories have now been shown to be a minor part of a greater theory, 11-dimensional M-theory. No doubt Kaku will explain this too in due course, but until then remember the theory in this book's no longer valid."
negative,"Buyer Beware: Well, I've gone through two of these and both malfunctioned repeatedly. The first unit was a Christmas present. Worked the first time, then would not load dvds (several were tried) and once I got to work again it was very inconsistent, froze up, and often would not load. Put it in the car for our kids to watch in the second seat of our minivan and it took many tries to get it to work.After return to Target got a new one and while this one worked the first few times, it was not possible to hear it at full volume on a plane, a big disappointment. Once overseas, it started freezing up and doing strange things again.I've learned my lesson on this one. The Audiovox is not ready for prime time and i would recommend being very wary of this product."
positive,"Useful litecubes for different events: I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests. (It is such a great gift in festival's sovenuior such as wedding, X'mas or Halloween.) Litecubes are economical and will certainly provide entertainment for your guests, especially in darkness environment. If you want to buy Litecubes, you can contact us as follow email address: icubesworkshop@yahoo.com.hk"

positive,gr8 movie: Jeffrey is funny man who just scared and took everything to another level at least until another guy came his way to explain that it aint bad!
negative,None: Couldn't get the device to work with my network so it just sits there useless.Vendor exceeded delivery expectations!
negative,"Pretentious Attempt: In retrospection, Kinsey is over-rated. It rides on the 21st century's fetish of sexuality and pretends to be another ""Beautiful Mind"" but fails and flops. It is one of those pretentious artistic attempt."
positive,"Wonderful: We had to watch this in French class and I thought it would be a really boring movie, but it wasn't. This is a wonderful movie for students studying french and anyone who likes the language. Jean de Florette is the movie before this one and it is also awesome."
positive,"my review: I loved this book. It showed clear research in its Celtic lore background. The main character, Lewis, made me feel as if i were him through the entire story. I was in his head, thinking his thoughts. All in all, this book is a definite must for all readers."
negative,"don't bother: Despite its reputation, this book seems to be totally pretensious, written to impress, rather than to communicate. Have we all been taken in?"
negative,"This Movie is absolutely Overrated.: I use to read for a while before buying any Stuff, So I think I usually make the right choice...But not with this one. This movie is totally overrated and weird. The characters, the music, etc., I was thinking what kind of people would enjoy this movie?. I think sadism and madness are not a good movie topic (in most times). If you watched Natural Born Killers and you liked it, I think you will enjoy this one too, but if you hated it (as me) you will hate this one even more. I consider myself as an open mind about movies, I enjoy very different genres but I don't get why anyone could enjoy movies like this one. If you want to compare your movie ""taste"" with mine, my preferred movies are: Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Men of Honor.....if you think your taste is like mine...STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE."
negative,"Horrible and pointless: I had to read this book for school and I hate it. It's too detailed and far too complex for my taste. About 2 chapters of the book talks about a man and Shane chopping at some big old stump, and the characters are all astonished and proud of them. It really makes no sense to me. I do not recommend this book to ANY high-school student if you need to read a book for school."
negative,"Good support, but expensive and not durable!: I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs. I did find them a little difficult to put on, but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was, like the other review stated...they ran the second time I wore them. For as expensive as these pantyhose are, they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer, if that is something you are looking for in support hose. They look more like tights when they are on your legs. I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade."
negative,Bad motor: My unit stopped working after the first few times I used it. I opened it up and saw that the motor brushes had popped out. This heat gun has a low price because it is cheaply made.
positive,Lovely book: A great addition to our homeschool library. Both the writing and art work are excellent. We used it for Arizona studies as well as desert studies for Science.
negative,"News about the author: For those of you who are not aware of it, the original author of this series passed away some years ago. Someone else took over writing the next several books, I'm not sure how many, maybe 2. I don't remember if it is someone from the family who took over the writing or someone else. Anyway, the books written by someone else are good, but they lack Jean Auel's distinctive way of writing. Just thought I would give a little perspective on this!"
negative,"Really should be zero stars: This product is really a disappointment. There are no menus and no lessons one, two, etc. On CD 1 you learn some basic words and then on CD 2 there is nothing but French. The other CDs are not much more help. I bought this program to learn French and now I'm considering not wasting my time, trashing it and starting again."
positive,"Excellent tv mini series: I first watched this tv mini when I was about 11 years old. It was scary to me. I always held my hands in front of my face when old Foxy Thunderburk would come on screen. I remember thinking about how old Sonny was so mean to people,especially blacks. I was glad when Foxy buried him and his motorcycle. I loved the acting as well. I am a great fan of the first and third chief, as well as Charles Heston. I have watch ""Chiefs"" twice in my life time. It has been over 13 years since I have watched it. I would love to own it this Christmas 2008. I'm going to start looking for it. I want the extended version."
negative,"A DUD: CANADA GREEN GRASS SEED 4 LB BAGI purchased 6 Bags of this grass seed,we live in Florida. I read the product info. very carefully and it stated all types of climate,so I thought Great,Finall I will have a nice Lawn. I followed the instructions to the letter not only did NONE OF THE GRASS GREW ,I tried to find the manufacturer of this product in Quebec ,Canda as stated on the bags but no luck.I am so upset nobody will give me a Refund as stated on the Web Site AS SEEN ON TV GUYS.Think twice before you waist your money."
negative,"Not happy: The quality of cotton used on this product is not good. It came out of the dryer covered with wrinkles, despite the fact that I dried it on a permanent press+wrinkle guard setting. I must iron it and who wants to iron a t-shirt???? I am very disappointed in the Columbia Sportswear company for putting out such a low-quality product."
positive,"Worth Buying: Neil Young has been one of my biggest influences, and he always amazes me with his brilliant albums. He bedazzled me with Greendale, his last album, and I was looking very forward to owning prairie wind, but as it turns out, pw is not as good as I expected. Don't get me wrong, it's a good album, but not great. I definitely like it though."
negative,"Beware, this isn't a new book.: I was pretty disappointed when I purchased this book because I thought it was the next book in the series. Instead it is just a compilation of the previous 3 books one after another."
positive,"Keurig B-70: I just got my Keurig a week ago, I love it, It makes great coffee, I know some reviews on it is not so good ,But I know if you follow the directions and take care of it , it will last a long time . Its just like taking care of a car you must maintain it, it does not maintain itself. Same thing about the Keurig B-70. I told my son who owns one for two years now and it is still working fine. true some times there are lemons I know how that is I have seen it in the auto industry for 30 years. But the Keurig company will take care of any problems that might pop up. Like I said the key word is Maintain it and it will give you good coffee for a long time. P.S Amazon is a great place to shop one of the best. Dom"
positive,"The Best: Since I discovered it I don't use anything else. Silky smooth and rich. Good for massages too, so very versatile all around. Try it, you'll like it!"
positive,"Da Real Sh%t: Just down to earth and real, you gotta have this one in your collections. ""African Move"" thats the move ni@@a's"
positive,"CLASSIC ACTION MOVIE: Featuring a fresh faced Mel Gibson as a young cop who faces down mobile savages on the highways of a dystopian Australia of the future. Mad Max managed to make a virtue of its modest budget, with some startling, influential stunt work and array of weird and surreal characters. Mel Gibson is perfect in the role of the idealistic young cop who feels that he is slowly becoming dehumanised by the brutality he is embroiled with on a daily basis. He quits the force and takes off with his family to try and escape from the madness and decay that is nearing fever pitch. However when his family are killed by a gang of marauding bikers, Max becomes the very thing he was trying to avoid, a broken, monoslylabic, avenging angel in souped up pursuit car. Very much a character in the vain of Clint Eastwood's man with no name from the spaghetti westerns, Max is a brooding, intense man with a capacity for terrible violence."
positive,"Awesome!: I was leery after hearing that it kept products lukewarm, but I tried it anyway. My beverages actually got hotter once put on the warmer! I have to turn it off after a while or it gets too hot!"
positive,"winter's tale: After the darkest night of the year, imagine it never got brighter.Faced with the unimaginable, Darak sets out to both return balance to his world and save the brother who's caught up in the struggle. The characters are richly drawn, from the haunted Darak to the dark and oh so enticing Morgath.One of my biggest problems with fantasy novels is that the women seem to just be there to worry about the hero, hope he likes them, and get rescued. In Heartwood, Griane is as strong as Darak. They're delightful characters to revisit again and again. Heartwood was a fantastic read."
positive,"Fits like a glove: Aside from a few clunky themes and vocals, this is an exhilarating set of intellectual fusion that hardly derails into detached theory."
positive,"An excellent, excellent, most excellent epic War Movie.: The Longest Day has been made to an accurate scale. The all star cast is unbeatable, the battle scenes are utterly, fantastic! The invasion scenes were very accuratly done, the action is: Wow!. I think that this is an excellent film also because it does NOT treat all Germans as criminals, and portrays them as human beings, that can celebrate birthdays, play cards, joke around, as we all do. This film did NOT have to have the blood and guts, and the foul language, as Saving Private Ryan needed, in order to portray the film as was wanted. This film has merits all its own, and conveys the essence that is meant, while maintaining the position as being a movie for all ages."
negative,"Big Build-up for Nothing: If you don't mind the liberal propaganda and the way Berry totally ignores any Scripture that contradicts his agenda, you may enjoy this book. It is a page-turner. However, when the third secret is finally revealed, it is quite anti-climatic after all the build-up it was given. I was expecting something apocolyptic and got the Democratic platform for social policy instead. Conservative Catholics and all Christians who happen to believe the Bible is true will find the book offensive."
positive,"New Fan: My Latin American Perspectives professor brought this CD in when we were studing about Argentina and once I heard it I had to get it! Truely fabulous music, I've bought another CD of hers since, but this one is my favorite. Knowing the history of Argentina and the Dirty War where 30,000 people were ""disapeared"" makes this CD that much more powerful. A definite buy for anyone who loves beautiful music!"
positive,"Good movie, interesting history, makes a point.: The self-proclaimed morality police won't like this one much because part of the point of the movie is that they get in the way of people understanding important things, like the science of how their bodies function.Other than that, it's a good movie. Well acted, moves along quickly."
positive,"A Masterful Work of Art: The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is honestly one of the best albums that I have ever plunked down money for. The depth of artistry inherent in this record is just mind-boggling; and rarely do you hear this much soul poured out in 70 minutes. Many are calling this a landmark album and I agree. The fact that it just won FIVE Grammys should cement that fact. If Lauryn continues in this same vein I believe we have the next truly revered musical legend on our hands re: Aretha Franklin, Elton John, Bob Dylan, etc.. Do yourself a favor. If you want to hear some truly superior music, give it a listen"
negative,"Baby Spring Float - Very Dangerous Floation Device: If you have an active child, this is not the floation device to buy. My granddaughter almost drowned. The float flipped over and the weight of the float held her head under water. Even with very short reaction time to flip the float back over, she was terrifed and now is afraid of the water. I threw the Baby Spring Float in the trash. I know it is better than most floation products on the market, but I would rather hold her in the pool, than have her drown."
positive,Superb: I bought this because I am a huge Batman fan and love the movies directed by Christopher Nolan. This guy is a visionary. The limited Giftset edition is a plus. You get a set of added content that I don't think you will be able to get anywhere else. The movie in Blu Ray is just perfect 10/10. If you're a fan then get this
positive,"Sure I am a Maoist, this book helped me recover: I first read this book in about 1968 at the age of 9. I read it again in high school and started to grasp more than the word paper tigers. I understood the idea of party politics and it helped me do well in high school political science. Later in life reading it invigorated me along with the bible I started to rebuild my life. I became a left wing survivalist. Now days I think I can see the bitter truth's of idealism mixed with blood and guts that was Mao and his experience. It still inspires me but I would hate to have to believe in it, in it's reality, considering the pain and death behind it. I think it shows that military minds around the world at all ends of the spectrum keep good discipline and we should fault soliders only for ending lives early and causing suffering. No solider does right in action only in word."
positive,Batman is back and this time he is buying Hotels and changing the rules on Swimming: Good movie .. and best actor for this character to date.
positive,"mest is soo damn great!: umm to put this in a few simple words ... mest rocks and so does this cd. ""destination unknown"" is one of the greatest cds i own, and i own well over 350 cds. this is just one of the cds i can put in my cd player and listen to it until i fall asleep, and thats usually after around 4 times of it playing over and over again. mest is not just some band that just has songs that are all joking, sure they have some funny songs, but songs such as ""drawing board"" have some meaning to it. to summerize GET THIS CD NOW!!"
negative,"wonderful nutri-cal: Sure, this product has some great reviews, but what gimmick exactly are you buying? Sugar, oil, more sugar, more oil and some vitamins. Try perhaps some whole milk yogurt with a bit of sweetener and some brewers' yeast flakes for protein and B vitamins - it's a whole lot cheaper.Anyway, here's the nutri-cal ingredients as found on the web:Corn syrup, soybean oil, malt syrup, cod liver oil, cane molasses, methylcellulose, water, gelatin by-products, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), sodium benzoate (preservative), manganese sulfate, ferric ammonium citrate, thiamine HCI, niacin, calcium pantothenate (source of calcium and pantothenic acid), magnesium sulfate, pyridoxine HCI, riboflavin 5' phosphate sodium (source of vitamin B2 and phosphorus), vitamin A palmitate and D supplement, folic acid and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12)."
positive,"A Perfect Murder?: I greatly enjoyed this book. The half-Caucasian, half-aborigine Detective Inspector Napolean Bonaparte (Bony to his friends) becomes involved in this case hoping he's found the perfect murder. A man named Marks visits Windee Station then vanishes. The local police assume he was lost in the bush but Bony has reason to think differently. This mystery is populated with a host of interesting outback characters, aborigines, blackmailers, secondary mysteries, and an awe-inspiring fire. The vision of 1930's Australia is exotic to us in this day and age, yet presented with complete understanding. It is worth noting that Bony and his contemporaries are well aware of his biracial status and some of the language used may bother some. The original copyright of this story is over 60 years ago though, and Mr. Upfield's heart and intentions are in the right place."
negative,"Just a weird read...: ""I'll agree with another review by saying I can't believe this author was actually published again after this one. I'm stupified of the amount of rape and attempted molesting of a fifteen year old that goes on in this book. I do realize however that teenagers were not considered children in the time period this novel took place, but the characters are cruel, indescent and flat out mean. And I really can't stand the fact that Kitty ended up with the one man who started it all. Love is never an excuse for the kind of things that went on in this novel... I finally quit reading it about halfway through and skimmed my way to the end.I'll not count this author out as of yet though, she's obviously writing something better than this because she's got pretty high ratings on goodreads and she's got a list of books a mile long, so we'll see."
positive,"Hallelujah!: This was the first in the series, and i was ""hooked"" until I finished book#5. Amazing Bible based fiction. I was so encouraged when I saw the characters ""come to life"" with Ms. Autens' literary skills. Recommend all five as a very good read and study."
positive,"An alternative to Prozac...: ...and I mean that as a compliment. Call me crazy, but I like this movie. Sure, it has little to nothing in common with the book of the same name (the director even admitted it in his commentary) and sure the plot must take enormous leaps in logic in order to work but hey, that's its charm. This is a charming film, and it's so sweet and placid and cute that I just like to put it on and enjoy the bright colors and M.J.Fox's wonderfully earnest vocal performance. Plus, the animation of Stuart & the cats is nothing short of brilliant."
negative,"While Watching A Disaster Film, A Monster Floated By...: I guess I would have enjoyed ALTITUDE a lot more if: A) It wasn't sold as a monster movie. B) The actual creature had been in it for longer than 20 seconds. C) The whole film had been about 30 minutes in length. As an ""airplane-in-trouble"" movie, it could have been OK. That is, minus the flying octopus. As it is, I found myself waiting for something interesting to happen, only to have all hopes dashed. Please, if you are expecting a horror / monster movie, just forget it. Otherwise, you're in for a bout of air-sickness..."
positive,"Corn Farm Boy - Lois Lenski: This is a wonderful book about farm life in the 1950's, written from the viewpoint of a 12 year old boy, called here Dick. He does all the things farm kids did in those days. He fakes sickness so he can be home when the new tractor drives in the lane, rides the cows, makes pets of everything, falls in the creek. His dad farms on the contour and the neighbors think he is crazy. Lois was in the habit of visiting the homes of children in whatever part of the country she wrote about, got to know the kids by staying with them a spell, and then wrote about them. I highly recommend all the Lois Lenski regional books."
positive,Fun: Plastic but sturdy great for the imagination well priced child enjoys playing with it came quickly and would buy again
positive,Women's rights: This is a beautifully written novel painting a strong picture of women of the 1500's. This book has helped me appreciate the struggles of women through the ages. A great read.
negative,"Another film made for a reason I can't see: The gets thrown into the mix with films like ""Fight Club"" and such. Obviously, the makers already new that it wouldn't be hit. With the Mummy, casting Fraiser was a bad idea. Everyone is used to seeing him as a dopey yet cute character in movies like ""George of the Jungle"" and ""Blast From the Past"". I think after the making the total flop ""Dudley Do-Right"", Fraiser wanted to play a different kind of character. Well too late, cause everyone is used to the regular kinds of characters he plays. I was not very impressed because of this fact."
negative,"Polemic: I bought this book because it was given either one or five stars. So I thought it must be very (!) controveral. If you are looking for a scholary insight in catholic theology, you will be at the wrong place. You can get better books on this subject by evanglical scholars. I highly recommend the book of John Armstrong (ed.)""Roman Catholicism etc"". To get catholic theology right read catholic sources and compare it with the evangelical view. If you do this you get some new ideas and possibillities to interpret scripture. Especally if you compare the modern evangelical thoughts with the Early Fathers. There you can see protestant errors, but also catholic errors. For an honest seeker of information this book is too polemical, but it is not as bad as some of the (fundamentalist) catholic rewiewers said."
positive,"Succinct Treatment of Malpractice Issues For Physicians: The focus of the book is on the ""administrative"" end of the medical risk management spectrum. A book like this is a must for a physician facing a first time medical malpractice claim.My only desire is for a more substantial treatment of physician practices that mitigate risk prior to a claim being made."
negative,"reneeaggie98: This is not my favorite toy! The most annoying part is the fact that it is large and hard to put away. The directions for how to fold it back up are not well written and I guarantee no one is smiling like the lady in the picture when try to put this thing back in it's storage bag! And after a few times of storing it, now it won't pop back up correctly and can't stand on it's own. The next thing is that the balls get EVERYWHERE. I find them for days after we use this toy. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that my two year really does like playing in it despite the fact it is so warped the tunnels don't even attach anymore."
positive,Family favorite: Great family movie. Have enjoyed this movie when my now adult children were little. Now am seeing it again with my youngest son. All time favorite
negative,"Cheaply made, NOT reliable: The Rhomba is cheaply made. Mine stopped working completely after about two months. Piece of garbage."
positive,A must read: This is a must read for anyone concerned about the future of the U.S. It clearly points out the danger we are in by having the government allow religion to govern their policies.
positive,"Suspenseful & Scary, but still lacks Teeth!: This book was much, much better than ""Autumn."" This story had better character development (Altho, it still could have used more depth to the folks we're supposed to care about. But, still an improvement). And there was much less of folks sitting around talking and talking and talking about what they should be doing instead of doing something. I liked how we revisited the main characters from the first book. And the zombies were scary, except they didn't bite. Still, this was a great improvement and I'd be interested in reading the books that followed. This book had a good ending too. It was satisfying."
positive,This product saved my sanity!: I would recommend this to anyone! I bought it for my daughter who is a little freaked out by mobiles. I figured it was less intimidating. She's 5 months and can't turn it on with her hand yet - but she has taught herself to turn it on with her feet in the middle of the night and during naps. When she wakes up - she turns it on - watches it for a while - and drifts right back to sleep. It's so quiet that my husband and I never know it's turned on unless we get up for some reason and see a little light shining from her room. I've also heard it come on while she's napping through her monitor - and then it stops and she never makes a peep and goes back to sleep. This is an A+++ product for those of you with a sprited child who wakes up from naps and won't go back to sleep. My daughter LOVES THIS AQUARIUM! Thank you Fisher Price!!!
negative,"Oh Will You Please Give It A Rest: Oh boy, ""irrefutable proof"" of the power of prayer, how scientific. This is just another heap of stuperstitious bunk to throw atop the rubbish pile of new age pseudoscience.Anyone can take a picture of water to make it look however they want it to look."
positive,So easy and convenience.: Just opened the package connected the adapter to the usb port on my tivo and it was instantly recognized. Entered my network password (WPK) and done.
positive,"First sighting of Wolfe: Of course, a must read for Wolfe fans. Archie has yet to find his true voice, and there's no Cramer yet, but Wolfe starts as he means to go on. Stands the test of time better than any of the other early books before Some Buried Caesar. A good and original plot."
negative,"The Adoption theme is problematic: Adoptive parents should be aware of the problematic aspects of this movie for kids who were adopted. When Stuart's biological parents arrive on the scene and announce that they want Stuart back, his adoptive parents hand him over, no questions asked. There is no sense that adoption is permanent. If your adopted child sees this movie, be prepared to discuss it afterwards and assure your child this would never happen in real life."
positive,"Good insights: If you're looking for good insights on criminal behaviour, this is it. I liked it and learned a few things I hadn't already explored."
positive,"really good and DVD makes it complete: This is really good. I needed to brush up on my Tai Chi having got ""rusty"" after years of no practice. The DVD has some good pointers and exercises that really help.Highly recommended."
positive,"Great Nariation but not that good of a book.: This audio rendition of Charles Dickens Hard Times features the renowned voiced of Paul Scolfeild, distinguished British actor. I found the narration to be very well done and it helped me get into the story but I have to say that I did not find the story to be a classic. There is not too much depth to the characters and the pace of the story seems to go too fast. All in all a decent book, perhaps worth while listening to it, but not one of the greats of world literature."
negative,Garbage: This product was simply garbage and that is where it ended up just minutes after attempting to hang the ironing board on it...in the garbage!
positive,"Can't vouch for content, but packaging is really nice: As I said in the title, I can't vouch for the content as this was purchased as a gift for my Dad. However, the packaging is great. I thought Amazon made a mistake and sent a book instead of the DVD package, but it turned out to be BOTH a book and the DVD's (guess I should have read the description better). In any case, I know they are classic movies and this deluxe presentation will make an impressive gift."
negative,"duh: It is now official: According to a poll done by the book ""British Hit Singles and Albums"" and ""NME.com"", 2 June 2006, this is now the No.1 album of all time. It has displaced ""Sgt. Pepper"". Yeah, and the Dave Clark 5 are better than the Beatles, Diabelli is better than Mozart, Cherubini is better than Beethoven, Def Leppard is better than the Rolling Stones, and Oasis is better than ANYONE that ever made a rock album. Give me a break. It is listenable. That is about all you can say positive about it. I could say a lot that is negative, but what's the point? The Monkees ""Greatest Hits"" album has more innovation (really, I'm serious -- I'm not knocking the Monkees). The most overrated album of all time. Put your money to better use."
negative,SITHSPAWN-i hate this book: Not sence reading the crystal Star and the Black Fleet Crisis Trilogy have i detested a book! If you want the point of the book watch the Simpsons parody. It's funnier and it makes fun of Bill Gates.
negative,Waylon and friends: This DVD is not good. It's to short 43min. and including many songs in playback. To much talk and few songs.
negative,Costs $10.89 at Target online: Costs much less at Target but I won't buy it because of bad reviews on Amazon. Will buy a bigger canister when I find the right one.
positive,"For the young and young at heart...: As a ""mature"" in body (not always in mind) crocheter, I still appreciate the fun projects that can be made with crochet. I've never been an ""afghan"" only person (too impatient), but I do like the granny square purse in the book. There are other fun projects (a bikini, if you have a fantastic bod)that won't take too much time or money.I have a few younger nieces and I'm always looking for short and sassy projects to make for them (who am I kidding, some for me too)and this book has a few I will surely put on my to-do list."
positive,"wow!: I think that the reason most people don't like the book is that they do not understand the fine symbolism. I mean, some people don't read between the lines, because they still think it is a ""boys on an island"" story. Let me tell you something right now: this story is about the fact that humanity isn't all that civilized. The theme I got from this story is, ""Civilization is the root of all evil. Evil is the root of all civilization. The two are often interchangeable."" Think on it. Then, if you don't agree, mail me and we'll talk it out."
negative,"Don't Try This at Home, Kids...: This book would be a joke if it were not dangerous. There's nothing wrong with being guided on a mountain...in fact, it may be a comparatively safe way to enjoy an outdoor experience (and it keeps many climbers employed. There's also nothing wrong with writing about the experience of being guided...David Roberts, Jon Krakauer, and others have done that entertainingly and tastefully. But to title it ""the extreme...true courage...death-defying survival...a quest"" shows serious signs of self-delusion. I am most concerned that some innocent will pick this book up, enjoy it, and do something really stupid.Hint: If you liked this book...if you really found it exciting...stay home!(1 star, in honor of the book's value as kindling, and because there is no lower rating.)"
negative,"Eeeehhh.....skip this one: I basically found Dune to be an airball in comparison to the reviews some people gave me. The plot was too intricate, the book was too long, and for God's sake it is a pain to have to flip back to the glossary every page or so. I actually began to uderstand the book at page 425 when the Baron is discussing his plans with Thufir Hawat...but I shouldn't have to read that much for it to get interesting. And I hate to get all of you SF freaks angry...but Frank Herbert was a BAD WRITER. Some of the things he describes are very clunkily worded, sentences either too brief or two wordy. Plus he never used the word ""and"" in the entire book. An example would be a sentence like ""He walked over to the case, opened it."" It just got annoying after awhile. It is a long dull story told with modest talent."
negative,"what a waste of time: One of the most stupid and poorly acted movies I have seen in some time, and I like a good sci-fi movie, too. Bad. Just not worth your time."
positive,"The greatest book of all time: I love this book and all its movie versions. I would love to see the sequel to it made into a movie(Timothy Cratchit's Christmas Carol,1917 by Dickens and Powell)"
positive,"Mindless, outrageous fun...: The heroine's over the top, kooky, and violent, but the author makes it fun. I didn't read the first two books about her best friends, but I get the idea that they're all blood thirsty and out-of-control. Not so believable, but that's not what you expect in a shapeshifter book anyway. Fun, light reading."
negative,"Seemed like a good concept...: First off, let me say that I have been braiding hair for two decades and although I am not a licensed professional, I think I would definitely qualify as an experienced braid technician, or whatever you wish to call it. I bought this product because I thought, ""Wow! This is pretty cool! It might spare the tips of my fingers from being burned"". Well, I was wrong. It doesn't ""cut"" the braid as described. It burns off the bottom portion and creates a finished look that is quite tacky considering that you have to clamp down on the braid longer than you might expect just to ""cut"" it. I ended up using my lighter. Whoever designed this should get back to the drawing board. Do not buy this product unless you want the end of your braids to look like a big flat piece of melted plastic. To give this item one star is giving it way too much credit."
negative,"one size doesn't fit all: this is supposed to be GE's answer to all the ice maker problems and is supposed to fit them all, it is a poor replacement for factory icemaker. wire hook-ups are generic and can't be properly placed for the maker to be hung and ice tray slid under, to top it off with, if you have a fridge with water and ice, this only comes with the water valve with one hook-up for the ice maker, so you can't replace the water valve like the instructions say that you must do in order for it to work. I guess if you have the bottom of the line GE ice maker, this kit would work fine, but you are paying for all the extra parts and un-needed ice tray"
negative,"I Promise You, It's Not: A 1-star rating is being generous. It's a terribly boring movie that really makes no sense. The main character is very much the Everyday Man, and you don't need a movie to let you know that life is stressful. If you've come this far w/o knowing or experiencing that, then maybe you should watch this movie. I promise, for almost a full 2 hrs, you will be distressed. I was. It wasn't funny. And now I'd like a refund."
positive,"The Clean Sweep: It was amazing what this vacuum picked up. It's a little heavy but does a heck of job.There should be a place for the cord to rest while in use; I carry it in my left hand otherwise it gets caught under the vacuum.Just one feature that's a little short and that's the hose and attachment. They could be a lot longer for clearing away those ceiling cobwebs. I prefer the vacuum to a dust mop.However for the price, it's a real good buy."
positive,"An amazing CD. . . the best of '98-'99: Wow, this is the best CD I've ever bought! The haunting melodies, hooks, riffs, and tempest refrains are incredible. It follows the same formula as the 1995 debut but polishes it, and makes it much catchier. The standout songs are (practically all on the CD): Temptation Waits, I Think I'm Paranoid, When I Grow Up, Special, Push It, The Trick Is to Keep Breathing, Dumb, Sleep Together, Wicked Ways, and You Look So Fine . . . and all the other songs are nearly as great. Really you MUST buy this CD!"
positive,Journey into Management: I have been studying this textbook all semester for a college course called Principles of Business Management. When I first looked at the book I found it eye catching. They made the book look like fun. I also became interested to learn what was in the book after reading the table of contents. My favorite section has probably been the chapters on leadership. I am very impressed that the authors put so much into this section of the book. They recognize that it is the most important part of management and I agree. We can learn all we want about how to manage but if no one follows our leadership then it is worthless knowledge. I cannot justly say how this book could be improved based on the information it provides. I haven't experienced being in a management position yet so I cannot discern what facts are useful or not. I found the book easy to understand and up to date. It was honestly one of my favorite books that I've used in a course so far.
positive,great price and great product: Great price. better than any other shops around here. Great product too.All my family and friends love this product as well.
negative,"Promise broken: I complained about product misrepresentation (they are advertised as 3"" and are only 2-1/2""). They advised me they had been out of the 3"" at the time of the first shipment, but would send the correct ones and I could return the small ones. I've never received the replacements, and suspect they never had 3"" in stock."
negative,Completely useless: I used this for a year and a half on a wart on the underside of my big toe. All it did was kill all the healthy skin around it.
positive,"Great product!: Hey GuysThanks for the product, arrived swiftly and is in great working order really happy! What an awesome movie go SA!!!"
negative,Nothing new.: This album would have been good if released 20 years ago when shredding was the rage. Nowadays guitaring like this is a boring to listen to.
positive,Spring horse: I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it. He plays with it all day every day. He can be rambunctious and so far it is holding up nicely. It took 2 people to assemble.
positive,"A book that can change your life: I read this book (the first time, at least) when I was 15. I agree, some of the content may not be appropriate for adolescents. However, the message the book gave me has changed my life for the better. In Brian, I saw the power of dreaming big, of not forgetting and to never stop persuing your dreams. It opened my eyes and the world became a much more exciting, magical place - much like the wonderful places Llywelyn describes in her books. All of her books are moving, and often leave you shaken and begging for more - but this one contains so many powerful lessons wrapped up in an engrossing, epic, and mostly true story! If you havent read it yet, you are truly missing out."
positive,Who knew?: I couldn't put this book down. Got home from work and read all weekend... Back at it when I'd get home. Couldn't getenough of these new ideas and information that explains so much about the abandoned structures and misunderstood native cultures of the Americas. I love the new way of thinking about our history that seemed so obvious as I read. One of those times I'd like the author to know I'm grateful.
negative,"moldy sand: This sandbox is terrible. We have had it for one year now and it doesn't keep the water out even with the lid on. In fact, there are such large gaps between the lid and the box that it becomes an insect haven (spiders, earwigs etc). The wind has blown the lid off several times. And so much moisture got into it over the winter because the lid didn't fit properly that when we opened it up this spring all the sand was moldy on top. Talk about disgusting. Unfortunately, my hubby is really frugal so he won't let me buy a new box for our girls but for those of you still shopping, my advice is to save yourselves the hassle and spend an extra $10 or $15 on a better box."
positive,Greatest animated show ever: This is the best animated series ever. I found it originally on Youtube and fell in love with it. I'm so pissed that it's cancelled. The show is a comedy blendin slapstick and paroding teen dramas. the cast itself is enough to make you laugh. the DVD is in great condition by it and maybe just maybe the show will come back.
negative,"language book: this book is impossible to read unless you already know the Ukraine and English language. The book is not written in the ""English Alphabet"" to be able to read the Ukraine language."
negative,"Worst comedy of the year: This has got to be the worst comedy I have seen all year. I don't recall through the whole movie laughing more than once. The plot was totally idiotic. I really don't understand why these actors do these movies, I mean don't they read the scripts? This movie is so bad that I wouldn't even recommend renting it. The only reason I watched it all was because I payed PPV for it and didn't want to waste my money. Through the entire movie you just keep waiting for it to get funny but it just never does."
positive,"Great Reading: Christine Feehan does it again, for all of you that have only read this one book by her, i strongly suggest that you read them all!"
negative,"Worst book I've ever read cover to cover: I received this as a gift because I am a huge JA fan. I read it through to the end because I read all books related to JA. I cannot believe this book has a rating of 3/5 stars. The plot, as continued by Barrett is absurd in the extreme, and, as others have pointed out, inconsistent and capricious. There is almost no dialogue, a distinct departure from Austen's usual style. A smarmy, confused, verbose narrator conveys most of the ""story line."" Adding insult to injury is the unnatural and awkward writing style. Barring a few grammatical constructions and vocabulary changes, Austen's language is not so different from our own. Barrett would have us believe that people, in truth, fly everywhere and use the conditional every other word. Would that eager JA readers could but be warned away from this unhappy collection of words!"
negative,"Do not buy this to give as a gift!!: When you load it up with pictures, choose you custom settings, and give it to your granny... You will find that your custom settings are forgotten every time it is unplugged. This is inexcusable!"
positive,Good Stuff: French children's entertainment is hard to come by. I loved this DVD. It is also good for French students.
positive,Great product: Just what I needed to get me headed back toward my pre-pregnancy waist. Bought an XL and probably could have fit into the large. Looking to down size soon!
negative,"A horrifyingly bad horror movie: This movie really blew chunks. The acting is boring, there isn't a storyline until the end, and everything else is bad. Take my advice and don't see this movie, see Halloween Ressurection."
negative,"Please, don't put this film on us guys!: I am a woman and this movie is not what women want. This movie was terrible. The guy was a jerk and he stayed a jerk and if he came to me and told me he stole my job, I would have punched him. He would have annoyed me anyway saying every little thing I said after I thought it. Mel is old; the movie may be great for some porky housewives drooling over Mel. And the movie is filled with stereotypes--the typical skirt chasing men in the office for example. It just plain stunk and I wasted a Sunday afternoon on it when I could have been twiddling my thumbs."
negative,"Bad Lieutenant = Bad Movie: I gave up on this thing halfway through. I just could not watch any more. Cage runs around in a badly cut suit, his head turned at an angle as if he can't hear the director, and there is no discernible plot or purpose. We don't notice Cage's bad acting the way we did in Wicker Man, because all the rest of the actors are so bad Cage does not stand out. One good thing about the movie is, Cage plays a coke addict. The bad thing about it is, he didn't OD and give us all a break.We can give this one a pass, though."
negative,"Film fails to capture the magic: The quality of filming is so poor, the beauty of the music and the singer are lost. I saw the ""30's version of this as a child, and I wish I could get that....this was a real disappointment. Munsel sings beautifully, but the film itself is boring, and the quality is poor. Unless you really, really love Munsel and the music, don't buy this film."
positive,"Musiq does it again!!!: When I first bought this album, I wasn't sure how I felt about it, unlike my immediate love for the first two. But recently I had the pleasure of seeing Musiq in concert and he made me go and reevaluate/rediscover this classic that I had been sitting on since it first came out!! The entire album from beginning to end is very well put together. Out of the 15 tracks, 11 of them are my favorites. Musiq, keep doing what you do best!!"
positive,"Still a Great Story on 3rd Reading: Whilst light in character and plot compared with the epic Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit is still a great read and provides some context for the later story. The dwarves are never as likeable as the elves but Bilbo's adventures bring him into contact with Gandalf, Beorn and the Elves. Definitely a recommended read if you like this fantasy world."
positive,"An awesome mystery trip: This was the first Beatles album I ever got. I thought it was okay. But now that I'm really into them, I've begun to appreciate it. The title track is a catchy tune, with a nice brass part. Then comes one of the better McCartney songs, Fool on the Hill. I like the recorder. Flying is pretty good, and very underrated. Blue jay way is a neat song, too. I am The Walrus (no you're not, said little Nicola) is a brilliantly silly song, with an interesting fadeout and positively weird lyrics.Hello Goodbye is one of Paul's better contributions. Strawberry Fields is arguably John's best work. The Mellotron part is cool. Penny Lane and Rich Man are some great songs. And, last but definetly not least, All You Need Is Love. What more can be said? The anthem of the sixties, it voiced the feelings of people aroud the world. I personally just think it's a good song. Overall it's a must buy. Oh and one more thing. Just because people say the movie is bad, doesn't mean you can't see it."
negative,"Very poor quality!: The assertion that ""This is one of the best thumb tips made on the market today"" is simply NOT true. I was very dissapointed with this plastic thumb tip - poor coloring and it has a very noticeable seam! I went to a local magic shop and purchased a rubber tip with great color and seamless for only $5. Buyer beware!"
negative,"Don't use in a teleportation device!: I bought this product as the final ingredient for my teleportation device. Well, it worked just fine for powering up the machine, but unfortunately my cat followed my into it during a test run. Now I'm half cat! I would be ok with that, I'm fond enough of cats to be one, but now my wife left me, because, well, fluffy was fixed. I can't see my kids anymore because the judge ruled that someone who jumps out the window regularly to beat up other cats is a bad influence on children. This product has ruined my life!"
negative,"not as funny as it looks: office space has nothing to do with space.space office is a comedy about a person who has a boring life with a boreing job ""only does 15 minutes of hard work a week"" when he goes to see a counciler, the counciler hipnites him an dies, which mostly means for the rest of his life he will start to become much more happey, he decides with two friends of his to do a frowd on his disturberd boss who keeps on saying ""yeaaa"" when the frowd goes wrong they begin to have a problem. has many funny scenes in the movie and has very little boreing scenes in it."
negative,"Awful transfer: This is an awful transfer from the original source material to DVD. Most of the film is muddy or dark, the scenes with Bilbo and Gollum being the worst. The soundtrack has several errors including gaps of silence, skips and lines being repeated. The movie itself it great, but take my advice and spend the extra few dollars to get the official Warner Bros. release. This version isn't suitable for The Dollar Store."
positive,Great simple game: I purchased this game for the holidays for my daughter who just turned four. The game is fast enough that it keeps her attention. She is able to follow along with the instructions of the game. It allows her to work on counting and following instructions.
positive,A Great Baby Book: This is a really cute baby book. The illlustrations on each page are precious. The book covers everything you could possibly want to record for your child's future reading. I can't think of any thing that was left out. I highly recommend this book.
negative,"tether broke: Is it squeeky? Yes. But I didn't mind. What I DID mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use. I didn't use it vigorously, and I'm only 160 lbs. I'd say avoid."
negative,PATHETIC AND AMATEURISH PRODUCTION: JOSEPH etc was a great and memorable show on stage (if rather short). This production is appalling and amateurish and the staging is on the cheap side. Many cast members are seen looking directly at the camera when they should not be doing so.It looks terrible.Who directed this rubbish.The Jason Donavan London stage show was far superior.Get a copy of that is you can.It's brilliant.Wait for a better version.This one is woeful and forgettable.
negative,"interesting but the value is doubtful: It is a lively and interesting book, however, it is almost impossible to agree with the author on the conclusions - he is way too lightweight in my view."
positive,Frasier: A great DVD by Usher; I love his music. The perfromances are great and the songs make you want watch the DVD over and over again. I recommend that you buy this one.
positive,A good book with a not so good ending: I thought William Golding's Lord of the flies was a great book. It had an original plot and was full of suspense and action. I would have rated it a 5 star book but the ending was terrible. At the climax of the book when Ralph is being hunted the author just decided to cut the story off. All in all I thought the book was pretty good
negative,"Unbiased Review - Magical Mystery Tour: ""Imagine"" if All You Need Is Love, Hello Goodbye, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields had been subbed into Sgt. Pepper in place of the goofy Mr. Kite, the horrid Within You Without You, and the lackluster Fixing A Hole and When I'm 64. That would have been an album.The reality is that the four good songs on Mystery Tour just can't overcome the likes of Blue Jay Way, Flying or Your Mother Should Know.Nevetheless, I rate this 2 stars because of the strength of the 4 best songs."
positive,It Worked: My only thing with it is how BAD it tastes you can't have it alone nor can you drink it with juice or milk or so the insstruccion say I do it any ways and it still works.
positive,pondmaster pump: Good durable pump. Works well if you have a sufficiently large filter so that you dont have to clean the filter frequently.
negative,"couldn't get past the introduction: ok... live and let live, that's my motto. so if you believe (or want to believe) in faeries and such, you may enjoy this book. personally i found it indigestible, and i lifted the cover with an open mind, genuinely hoping to learn. not my path, i guess. i look askance at any religion as a vessel and a tool to focus self and hopefully tap into something bigger, which is how i look at Magick; this ""guide"" read more like a disney movie. that's just my .02. i wish i could get my ten bucks back."
negative,"Uninspired: I picked this up back in '98 after seeing Hank III for the first time. Perhaps for the Hank Jr. fans it is worth your time but for me a Hank Sr. & Hank III fan it is disappointing. I'm aware of the family lineage but I don't need to hear this blend of voices to appreciate the songwriting talent of Hank Williams.I did talk to Hank III about this recording and it sounded like his dad's idea not his. Out of the dozens of recordings of all three of the artists, this is my least favorite for all of them."
positive,Good Read: I like the illustrations that came with the book. It is just as I expected based on the numerous movies based on the book.
positive,DreamCatcher: I thought the book DreamCatcher by Stephen King was an extremely interesting and well written novel. Despite the length it is certainly a book that many people should consider reading. The details and descriptions are awesome. It is certainly worth the time and once again it proves what a great writer Stephen King is.
negative,Please don't buy this globe.: E of Egypt is at one end and gypt at the other. Karachi is spelled Karacho. Portion of the Antartica is completely missing. Chittagong shows up in India instead of Bangladesh. Portions of Africa is missing.Buy a good globe even if it's for a small child who may not be ready for Geography lessons. It would be sad if the child turns out to be attentive and learns all the wrong lessons.
negative,"not as advertised: These blankets are not ""gray"". They are a multi colored mish mash of wool fibers. Probably useful as an emergencty blanket but not an attractive looking item."
negative,"Broken: I received this product in the mail yesterday, Put in the batteries and the rotating beads do not work. Complete waste of money."
positive,nice: This is a good app that works well with the system and we have had no problems with this app so far.
negative,"Not the best: Not the best imprint out there. No illustrations. Doesn't have the right ""feel"" (e.g., not calling the ""Staves"" ""Staves'!)."
negative,"Batman begins is bad, very bad batman: The music is bad, batman is stupid, the film is very very bad."
negative,"Not for the faint of heart.: This was very gory. I got it for my husband, as he is an avid snowmobile rider. After watching part of this... I don't know if I'll ever let him go to the mountains with his buddies, without supervision, anymore.... LOL"
positive,comfort: It is comfortable to my hand. I would recomend it to any one who needed to put a lot of pressure on their cane.
positive,"Gaddis' The Cold War: In a straight forward analysis that is easy to read and comprehend, Gaddis' study is the definitive literature of the Cold War. This reading is highly recommended for those interested in this tragic period in human history, that was completely avoidable. After a critical analysis of the research, it is agreed that Gaddis is the foremost historian of the Cold War era."
positive,"Part I excellent, Part II Good: I watched Part I with my 8 year old daughter. She absolutely loved it and so did I. It was so visual and captivating that she watched the whole 90 minutes in one go, even though she originally had said that she was only going to watch 30 minutes of it. I hope she will read the book in due time. I saw Part II by myself (I didn't let my daughter see it because I think she is too young to relate to it much). I think Part II was also very good although a bit choppier than the Part I (eg. the wickedness of Heep was not very fully developed). Overall though I still enjoyed the movie."
positive,"Beautifully acted, clinical bio: Kinsey is a very well made film. The performances are uniformly excellent. Neeson and Linney(as always)are great in this. Lynn Redgrave turns in an absolutely heart-breaking cameo at the end and the research boys (Saarsgard, Hutton and O'Donnell)all have their moments.While sexually explicit, it is very clinical in it's presentation. It serves to distance the viewer enough to make the in-you-face sex more palatable for those who might be more reserved, but also takes a good deal of the passion or emotion out of the story. Not a major gaffe for the research subject matter, but it feels a little cold.Beautifully filmed and acted, I still highly recommend this one."
positive,"Classic X-Files, but with a modern tint to it: This is highly enjoyable. Anyone who reads this book will read it over and over again. Mulder and Scully's midnight journeys to the middle of the desert are famous, and this one is no exception. The way Anderson decribes their frustration is amazing."
positive,"Déjà vu: This is one movie that provokes a viewer to look at her/him self from distance and question surreality of life. What is dream, and what is reality? Both are just a state of mind. I gave ""Triangle"" five stars for a decent attempt to twist and exploit this fact."
negative,"Simply defective!: It's smaller than your palm. Cheap, fragile plastic. Sticky stand. The Display is almost invisible.Above all, it just doesn't work at all. The temperature displayed is off by more than 20 degrees.I would still smash it even if it were free."
positive,A great book!: I loved this book! I strongly reccomend this to animal lovers and anybody who loves cats or nature. It is action packed! Chapers are always ended with suspense to keep you reading. Give it a try!
negative,"A very bad book: ...To my surprise and disappointment, I found ""Foundation"" to be an exceptionally terrible ""book"", totally undeserving of the praise it has received here. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged ""novel"" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature. In fact, the only time I should ever like to mention it again is as an example of poor writing, atrocious story-telling, and science-fiction that is totally wanting for any kind of inspiration. ..."
positive,"My teeth are definitely whiter!: Well these strips work great. I'm always skeptical about products like this because I've rarely known a quick-fix product to work for me, and I think alot of the time the results are all in the consumer's head. I also never have the patience to go through the entire duration instructed on the box. However, I've been using this product for two days now, and I already notice a difference, and my friends do too. I can only imagine how white my teeth will be at the end of the week. The fact that it only takes a week is worth it to me, too.The only reason I don't give this product 5 stars is because it is making my teeth ridiculously sensitive! I've had my mouth closed for an hour now and the pain still hasn't subsided. I might just be a big baby, but it's a very intense tingling, that of which I'm not sure I can handle for the entire week. However, all in all I do recommend this product and I doubt your experience will be as painful as mine."
positive,"The best of the best.: I am teaching in college since 25 years. We always used Macintosh.At home, I have a iMac. I used Office 2001,which is a very good product. Then I had to install APPLE X, then Ibought Microsoft Office X (including Word X) for teacher. I am filled. Ittook only 30 minutes to install it. Immediately I felt comfortable.There are many improvements. And the items that I used more werepreserved, and improved. Word is very pretty, powerful, more powerful,more quickly. All my documents of Office 2001 opened such as theywere. I did not lose any data. And the connection with the Web is the best to. I recommend it to my colleagues at work.Thank you Microsoft."
positive,"Christ is the Center of Christmas: Thank God that Charles Shultz was alive before the ""politically correct"" ambassadors of the world decided that we have to celebrate commercialism rather than Christ at Christmas. This is a delightful collection of winter and holiday vignettes that culminate in a wonderful Christmas celebration that has become a classic like Miracle on 34th Stree and It's a Wonderful Life. Parents should watch this with their whole families as it has appeal for all generations."
negative,"Save yourself the trouble: I'm pretty tech savy, and This is by far the worst experience ive had with ANY piece of electronica ever. Dont let the low price fool you, theres a reason for that. The drivers are terrible for this, Uninstalling this scanner requires 4 different programs, tech support charges you money for help (even though I bought this 2 weeks ago), and if you actually get the scanner to work it will take a good 25 minutes to get the 1200 dpi resolution scan. Also the software it comes bundled with (Scansoft Paperport) is horrible, i have 2 gbs of Ram and it ran as if i had 128 mb. the TWAIN compatibility is awful, and it isnt compatible with any third party software. I wish there was something good I could write about this scanner, Aftr 2 weeks I got fed up, returned the scanner and bought an HP. People please do not hurt yourself by buying this awful piece of junk."
positive,"great price for a great item: We needed a new vacuum so we were searching on the internet when we came upon this vacuum, first I thought it would be cheap, but it was a hoover, plus our old vacuum was a windtunnel thats back wheel broke off , it was 12 years old and worked fine other than that. well we got it real fast and it was easy to put together, I started to vacuum my bedroom and couldnt believe the dirt and dust this thing was sucking up, I had to dump out the container after I vacuumed this one room! Then I went on to the next room ,a 5x9 wool rug this was also dirty beyond my believe It got rid of the loose pile and made the rug look new again! every rug I did looked new again! I would recommend this vacuum , also the accessories work great. So for the price this isnt bad!!"
positive,"New to collecting? This will help.: Vastly illustrated and very informative. Although the majority of this book is pictures (very nice ones at that), there are some very interesting facts and historical information about the victorian card craze. Because there are in excess of 100,000 different cards in existance, don't expect to find every card in here or the current market price. It is just a matter of time before a more extensive guide is published, (I would still recommend because of the great illustrations!) The only problem I have with this book is the layout which can be annoying if you are trying to find info on one of your cards. You have to search through several sections of the book. (e.g. Jackson's chewing tobbaco card in the ""Exploration and Travel"" chapter instead of the ""Tobbaco"" chapter). More expensive cards are usually only discussed in the chapter rather than illustrated, which I find kind of strange(Maybe he didn't own any of those to get the photo?)."
positive,"Very Satisfying: BOGUS is a movie about a young orphan boy (Haley Joel Osment) who is reluctantly acquired by a career-minded temporary mother (Whoopi Goldberg). In his loneliness Osment invents an imaginary friend (Gerard Depardieu). The film is dominated by the interplay between these three characters and the result is very satisfying. The director is Norman Jewison who directed many other movies including IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT and JESUS CHRIST, SUPERSTAR."
negative,"Be wary of this charger: I was hoping for a cheaper replacement, but what I got was a charger that was not much more reliable than my previous Apple charger.The problem with this connector is that it doesn't always seem to make a good connection with the computer. When this happens, it sends the computer into a powered-charging-battery loop. I have to fiddle with the connector to get it in just the right spot to keep a good connection. While this is only an annoyance to me, I wonder what it's doing to the internals of my computer."
negative,Terrible binding: The spirals on the top of this steno pad are anoying to say the least. All 5 of the steno pads i bought are not smooth to open or operate because of the spirals on this book are weird i dont know how to describe it. In order to have it open or close coreclty i have to rip the binding out of the first and last holes of the cardboard and the sheets of paper. I recomend buying a different brand
negative,"Junk Music: Stop listening to her music years ago. How do you explain this person who only comes out to the public when she is promoting a record. Money $$$$$$$ is her only satisfaction that and puting down the United States to anyone stupid enough to listen. Barbie, go join Jane Fonda on your hate tours."
positive,"A joy to read! Not too technical, but full of useful info!: I liked this text because it presented the information in an unbiased manner. It used a lot of case studies and current events to support the various psychological theories. The CD ROM was extra helpful because it had quizzes over each chapter as well as videos."
negative,"The Worst SF Movie I ever saw.: It was the first time I ever felt a need to fast forward through a video and even then I couldn't stand to watch it. Fast forwarding through all the action on earth I was dumbfounded by the impossible plot on the space ship. Special effects or not, this movie is not worth paying for, I didn't - (checked it out of the local library).Take a hint from the Director credit: Alan Smithee - the real director did not even want his name on it."
negative,just started: iknow i given it 2 stars for now its gonna change soon. My brother who uses it for about 2 months now and oh boy his hair is so thick the residing hairline has gone.
negative,"Good Fun?: This is a fun movie if you like the romantic comedy.Why 1 star?? There is a scene where an old woman calls ayoung German couple ""facists"". The irony is, the old lady is Italian. Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."
negative,"Too old to matter: This book really should be removed from circulation. While basic MIDI information is in there, it is so out of date it just makes it hard to read. Examples are of obsolete or vintage gear and has no real relation to todays musician.Illustrations are all cheesy and look like bad microsoft clipart. Photographs are all poor and dated. The section on MIDI and a personal computers lists atari and commodore as possible good choices - get the picture!If you are looking for charts of Control codes etc, - they are in here, but you can find those anywhere. If you are trying to get information on MIDI in the last decade or so, buy a different book."
positive,"Get a clue: This cd is great, but the Amazon.com reviewer, Aidin Vaziri, is obviously not informed about the band of which he writes. If he were he would have known this is the FOURTH QOTSA release not the third. The band's releases in order are Queens of the Stone Age, Rated R, Songs for the Deaf and finally,Lullabies."
positive,"One of the BEST gifts we received!!: This was given as a shower gift and highly recommended by several friends. While we didn't use it much at first due to the limited playing time (I didn't wish this to become a nighttime dependency), it has certainly gotten good use since he was able to turn it on himself. Our son is now 2 and he still will turn this on at night and in the morning which is his cue for us to get him up. We have not had any problems with attaching it to his crib even after removing it for battery replacements. This is a great gift to give or get!"
negative,"WARNING - Don't read the Introduction first!: My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1."
negative,Complete Sumi-e Techniques NOT Very Good Condition!: This book was supposed to be in very good condition. It is not. Its cover is about to come off; the whole spine inside the cover is visible; the edges are ragged; in short it is in poor condition. I would hope the store would offer return compensation or another book in its place. Its the worse book I've ever received.
positive,"The Best Review that you can get: This is an excellent book for people 13 and older. The subjects in it can get a bit much for younger readers especialy things that have to do with love and war. This is a good book and it has vivid details about the time period and things going on. This book is about the development from boy to man for Adam Cooper. It is an excellent book and is very emotional. If you like historical fiction or even just a good intense book, this is a very good choice."
negative,"Feedback on the book: This book talks about Roald Dahl when he was young. He took part in the Second World War and this book deals with the time he went flying with the RAF in the war. Everyone dislikes going on wars but Roald Dahl enjoyed it. He thought that it was a free travel and it was interesting. He described all the interesting and exciting events happening to him. After three years of fighting and flying, due to the severe head injuries he had received when his Gladiator crashed in the Western Desert, he must on no account fly a fighter plane again and so went back home. I do not enjoy the story because I do not like wars. Wars are terrible and Roald Dahl described how he helped the others fight and how the others were shot and died. I felt upset when I read this book. I think this book is thick. The plot goes slowly and it makes the story boring."
positive,"The Best of ""D-Day"" Films Overall: Certainly The Longest Day can not compete with the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan; Saving Private Ryan, however, can scarcely compete with The Longest Day overall, for where Saving Private Ryan gradually slows to a standstill, The Longest Day continues to roll forward with considerable momentum and excitement from its opening shots to its final credits. Definately a ""Hollywood Movie,"" but in this case none the worse for that, with a grand and sweeping scope, a galaxy of international stars, and a cast of thousands."
negative,"Terrible: A bad book made worse by the fact it took twelve years to write. I really cannot add anything else that has not already been said. Ayla is the source of all technology, she discovers/invents every tool that ever existed. She is perfect in every way, shape and form. Far from making mistakes as she did in Clan of the Cave Bear, she executes every form of etiquette perfectly, no matter how new or strange it is to her.The book is poorly written, with cardboard characters that have no believablity. It's poorly edited, with massive amounts of repetition and run-on sentences. Entire sections of the book can be skipped with no loss to the story. Auel never seemed to catch on to the idea that a book can be short, and still be good.I won't go on any longer, because everything that needs to be said has been said in the spotlight reviews."
negative,"The book will not help people for the EXEMs.: I always trust MS Press. But this time I think that it is a shame for MS Press to release such an exam guide to cheat the Microsoft followers like myself. The book shows a very attractive table of contents to attract the buyers. It only contains the very high level overviews or technical commercial. The book should be titled as ""A Brief Intro to MS Windows `Pieces' and MS Technical Commercial"" instead of saying ""This kit offers complete preparation for taking and passing the Microsoft Certified Professional Exams 70-160 and 70-161"". If you want to know how many pieces that Windows has, this book may be OK."
positive,"Tender and Charming: Jenny Teale is a secret penpal to Captain John Braithwaite while he was fighting in the first Iraqui war. Her letters are intimate and win his heart. When he returns stateside, however, she refuses to meet him.JR doesn't know that Jenny has been wounded both physically and emotionally when a disastrous auto accident left her serious injured and abandoned by her (now ex) husband.He's determined to find his ideal woman, she's equally determined to be anonymous and independent. The resulting story is a delight."
negative,"too small for 6th grade: While jansport makes an excellent backpack, this particular one was too narrow to fit the massive amount of books that my son brings home. Had to look elsewhere for the larger Jansport backpack , unfortunately, Amazon had it for alot more, which is normally not the case."
negative,"Received melted: I am sure this is delicious as it had been recommended to me.However, it was completely melted when I received it, thepackage did not state PERISHABLE and the postage was expensive.I would not buy from this particular site again."
negative,"Don't let the big JAVA 2 on the cover fool you...: This book's main purpose was to teach the computing concepts using a little bit of Java. Don't plan on learning enough about the Java language itself to make something useful. I was deceived because I saw the words ""Java 2"" on the cover in big print. I guess one really can't blame the author for it because it does say ""Computing Concepts w/ Java2 Essentials."" It was still a disappointment to me since I wanted to learn Java from this book first. Of course, the price of this book is WAY too much for what it teaches. But if you want to learn just Computing Concepts, go ahead and buy it...however, I wouldn't recommend it =P"
positive,Excellent choice for learning classical guitar techniques: This is a beautifully put together book. It includes a CD with all the exercises pieces. It starts by discussing general posture and body position for playing. It then presents carefully organized studies that incrementally develop playing skills. These exercises integrate music theory with techniques for right and left hand in such a manner that it provides a very pleasurable learning experience. This book is the product of careful thought. It is well organized and clearly presented. It moves the student along at a reasonable pace and keeps the student's interest. I very highly recommend it.
positive,"Love it..: Great to read with kids...they learn while laughing at the different, funny words along with the pictures. Brings excitement to the pages and unleashes their imagination with humor."
negative,"Not Grisham's Finest: Usually John Grisham's books are a pageturner. Unfourtantly, The Last Juror is not one of those. I'm not even sure what the title is refering to. The first half of the book starts out strong but the 2nd and 3rd parts are weak. Parts of the book talks about Danny Padgitt but once the trial ends, it seems like Grisham is just filling paper to get a full length novel. There are even parts of the book where it's just gibberish. In fact, some things don't belong here.Last time Grisham visited Ford County was in the book A Time to Kill and that was 10 times better then The Last Juror as it had was filled with suspense and mystery but in The Last Juror, there's none of that. I like Grisham's past books but this one falls flat throughout."
positive,"Hard to Find Original Cooky Book: Our original copy of this book was worn from over 30 years of use. After many requests for the holiday cookies made from the recipes from this book, this inexpensive cookbook was an ideal Christmas gift for family and friends."
positive,Great Job!!!!!: I can see that God has really blessed these girls. The CD is great. Keep on singing for the Lord. I recommend everyone to purchase this great album.Keep up the good work.Lovelyone mason
negative,"Scotch-Brite Pads, 6x9: I was sent an item that was NOT what I ordered...I ordered a box of Scotch-Brite # 07445 light duty 6x9 scouring pads, what was sent to me was NOT a Scotch-Brite product...What was sent to me were white scouring pads that looked similar, didn't at all feel like the real thing and they had a perforated line down the center so that they could be cut or torn into 6 x 4.5 pads, they didn't come in a box and had no markings on them ( Scotch-Brite Pads actually have the name lightly printed on them). I sent the item back and received a refund, however it was an inconveinience as I needed the pads I purchased and had to reorder elsewhare which delayed my project!"
negative,"Long term failure: I've had this product for a little over a year now, and I'm about to toss it and move a to a Linksys.Over the life of the unit it has had occasional Internet drop outs that would require the unit to be powered off and on to recover. This happened infrequent enough to be a small nuisance that didn't rise to the level of replacement.Unfortunately recently the wireless of router has been dropping and then last week completely failed. Of course being out of warrantee, no support is offered.My guess as to the failure is that the unit simply runs too hot. Not enough engineering and too much in too little of a package. You could use it as coffee warmer.The reviews on the Linksys WCG200 look good and I'm braving the Comcast tech support tonight."
negative,"The title says it all: First World, ha! ha! ha!Yep! Mexico deserves to remain in the Third World where it belongs: mirred in poverty, with no future for its children, divided against itself, alienated from the rest of the world, with the army out of its barracks, with violence in every headline and blood spilling in every street just so Mr. Marcos can enlighten the Club Med-Left on the merits of armed revolution as opposed to mere burgeois elections. Thanks a lot! It's painfully obvious you don't live here, never read the man nor care at all about MY country!Mexico in the First World? HA! Who do they think they are!"
negative,"Mr. Coffee Drink Warmer: It is supposed to keep your coffee hot, but it doesn't even keep it warm. Very disappointed in this product, because I thought the brand name, ""Mr. Coffee"", was a guarantee of a good product."
negative,Doesn't work: This doesn't work at all. It came early thank goodness but after I ate the whole jar I was still constipated. The only thing it did was make my pee glow in the dark. What a rip-off!
negative,"another noisy melody free album to shake the lugnuts: i dont know what it is, but it seems like pearl jam keeps making these albums layered with noise that mix heavy with the whines of eddie vedder. perhaps their goal has been to shake accessibility. they've succeeded."
positive,Comfortable: I agree with the other reviews that you have to have thin wrists for this to fit/be comfortable. I'm quite petite and have a hard time slipping on the wrist weights.
positive,"For my little girl: I first came to Amazon to buy ""A Song For My Son on his wedding day"" But when I saw this beautiful song I couldn't resist getting it too. And I am not a person who buys a lot of music. I love this song it is perfect for my little girl."
positive,"I'm a hip-hop fan that likes Moby!: I am a hip-hop fan. I won't get into it, but if you knew of all of the other cds I own, you'd probably be very surprised that I not only own, but like this album. I would actually rate this cd 4 1/2 stars if I could. I really like the smash hits ""Southside"" and ""Natural Blues"". I also enjoy some of the slower songs on here as well. Also, even though I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan, I think that Moby has many great views about the world and is a class-act role model. The only reason I took off half a star was because since the album was so long, I just thought that there were some songs not good enough to be on the record."
negative,dont waste your time or money.: lower then low budget with horrible dialogue and acting. Two six year olds could have done better with a couple of kindergarten actors
negative,BROKE IN A MILLION PIECES: I was not able to see if this piece was nice or not. It broke into a million pieces on arrival. You could hear the delivery guy when he was walking to my door. VERY DISAPPOINTED because it was a gift. Returned it right away! Buyer beware!!
negative,"Photosmart pretty dumb: Bought Photosmart 1100 three months ago. Loved it till it thought my color cartridge was bad. Now printer will not recognize any new cartridge. Seems there's a hardware bug that the printer will not reset a flag that indicates failed color cartridge. I've bought 2 new color cartridges and a new black cartridge. Called HP & they had me clean cartridge 3 times, power cycle, and even sent new cartridges. Analyst at HP very nice, thought... still the display flashes ""Color Cartridge Failed"" and ""Replace Color Cartridge"". Won't even print B&W. Dumb thing..."
negative,"Not a true Widescreen Format!!!: Transformers The Movie is my favorite animated movie of all time. I was excited to learn this 20th anniversary edition was coming out. When I played it, I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the movie is great, and is worthy of all 5 stars. My low rating is because of the ""widescreen format."" The 16:9 format is NOT the theatrical version. It is merely the full screen version with the top and bottom trimmed off. If you don't believe me, look at the full screen version side by side with the ""wide screen"" version. It does have some great extra features, and the color is cleaned up, but this is not what is advertised on the box. If you are purchasing this for the full screen version or the special features, you'll be fine, but if you want the true widescreen version, you will be disappointed like me. Buyers beware."
positive,"Thrash Metal Survives: While most thrash/speed bands have watered-down their sound into something unrecognizable (Metallica) or begun to gravitate toward nu-metal (Slayer), there are a few that have retained their own identities, still playing the fast, brutal music that made them infamous to begin with. Sodom is one of those bands. The production from Harris Johns is top-notch and most of the songs are truly great, only a few descending into that mindless drum-pounding/guitar-shredding that can sometimes afflict bands that straddle the line between thrash and death or black metal. Are they repeating themselves? Most likely, but I'd far rather listen to this material than any other ""metal"" being released by ""progressive, forward-thinking"" bands like Korn; turn up ""Addicted to Abstinence"" or ""Visual Buggery"" and forget nu-metal exists."
positive,"Horse for Christmas: My son is a year and a half and has a serious thing for horses. So he was elated when he received this gift. The springs are pretty tight, but my son is huge. Anyway it's not very bouncy but is certainly serves it's purpose. Now for the real review... When you press the horse's ear the horse sings it's little song in a.... flaming ""alternative lifestyle"" voice. Which is cool.. to each their own. Kid's don't care or know and it's funny for the parents... the first 100 times you hear it. I just thought you should know!"
positive,love it: Im so excited to have all the great classics in one place even tho i purchased this used it was in perfect condition now my son can spend every December watching the classics
negative,Where was the story?????: Really a reminder and a rehash of her books. Did not have a story line. Really disappointed.
negative,Ewwww: I hate it. So boring. I fell asleep at the first page. its great if youre into that old 1800s kind of speech.
negative,"FALSE ADVERTISEMENT: I got this a couple of days before Christmas and found it did not come with a remote. I was also VERY dissatified with the unit not havining the USB ports.It works nice with black and white photos after resizing. Microsoft has a nice FREE resizer.Overall for the money I guess it is a good buy if you know what to expect. If I had it to do over I would pay a little more for a unit that had all that I wanted...I guess MOMMA was right, You get what you pay for..."
positive,"Babies LOVE this book!: We actually got this crinkle book as a gift from a Disney set (from Sam's Club, I think) and our son LOVED it as a baby. It was one of two toys we always gave him when he was in the car seat. When he was really young (3-6 months or so) we would hang it from the car seat handle, and now that he's older (6-13 months), we just hand it to him. We just love hearing the ""crinkle crinkle"" from the back seat when we're out and about. He plays with it and chews on it and it still looks almost brand new. I agree with another reviewer that it's more of a toy than a book, but I still can't wait for him to be able to read it! I highly recommend this book."
positive,"Well performed, so far....: High quality recording. Background ""sound effects?"" can be a little distracting.I am a Dune junkie, so I am enjoying listening to this on my commute to/from work"
positive,"Another one done!!!: Very very good!!....I can usually figure out who did it, not this time. so many complicated twists and turns. Great read!!!"
negative,"Sorry I didn't keep my receipt to return this: What a pain it is to deal with a bunch of little steel rods to slip into the pouches to adjust the weight. The picture and description didn't really show the product well when I ordered this rather pricey item. I took the weight out of the box, looked at it, and put it back in. Probably will donate to some worthy cause. I ended up going to a big box retail store and just buying a non-adjustable weight."
positive,"Response to Range: The range of any cb depends upon the antenna. A $30 cb on a good antenna will have considerable more range than a $150 cb on a cheap antenna. Inexpensive cbs do have less sensitivity and features of more expensive cbs, but if you are just starting out, I would suggest an inexpensive cb with a good antenna such as a Wilson 'Lil Will' magnet mount. If you purchase the antenna at a cb shop, normally they will be more than happy to install and tune the antenna for you free of charge. The antenna normally runs around $30 and is one of the better entry level antennas out there. I have ran a cb for 10 years and I still use one as a back up. But remember, the secret to range is in the antenna system.. not so much the radio. But whatever you choose.. do not get one of those 'through the glass' or a 'rubber magnet mount' antenna. These are poor antennas with very limited range, usually less that a mile. Get something with a steel whip equal to or over 36"" in height."
negative,"Short good text, overwhelming background noise and old film.: These two short tapes consist of a brief description of 50 years of white-red relations, treaties and conflicts. Because of its brevity, there is little detail presented. The text is interesting and appears to be factually correct. The presentation is relatively unbiased, and is quite interesting. It would make a good audio tape. The extra loud background music and simulated battlefield noise sometimes drowns out the text. The visual portion consists of old photographs, presumably authentic in detail and clips from old grade B movies which are quite far from authentic. These are rerun from 6 to 10 times throughout the presentation and, of course, have no bearing on the text. Except for the extreme brevity and the overwhelming background noise, one can ignore the visual effects and derive a worthwhile understanding of many aspects of the period of the Indian Wars."
negative,"Dull and pretentious: This book disappointingly fails to live up to its fame. A turgid, stream-of-consciousness narrative of social criticism, it seems only indirectly interested in its own subject matter. Wading through this dull and totally unerotic tome is in itself an exercise in masochism."
positive,"The Guide to Making Your Trolls Even Bigger Characters: Didn't White Wolf's short description in the Changeling rule book tell you enough about those big oafs that call themselves trolls? If you want to fill out your character so she isn't just a big, clumsy, not-so-bright, oaf, this Kithbook is a must. With new troll only merits/flaws and weapons and treasure, you'll have the tools to make your troll more realistic and unique. Included is a fairly detailed outline of Troll history since before the Shattering along with what the Trolls really think of the other kiths from both a Seelie and Unseelie perspective. With splendid artwork, a definite must buy for the serious Changeling participant. The only criticism is that the book is a bit on the thin side, but nevertheless is packed with information."
positive,"Great Tent: This is a great tent for kids and parents. Santa brought this tent to our 3 (soon to be 4) year old daughter and she loves it. It was the first thing set up after all of the presents were opened. It set up so easily and when we are done playing with it, it packs up into such a small bag - very easily stored. My husband is a very avid camper/backpacker so my daughter wanted a tent just like Daddy's. This is it, just a smaller version. The only complaint that I have with it is that you cannot lay a child's sleeping bag flat in it and that tends to frustrate her. Other than that though, we are very pleased."
positive,Rethink English historical mystery: My knowledge of Richard III and the War of the Roses period of English history was limited but this book draws you in to the 15th century. Although the complexity of the royal lines at times seemed a bit confusing the goal is worth the work. This is the type of read that transcends the mystery genre. I would recommend this book unreservedly.
negative,"alright: I bought this pillow after finding out a hotel I stayed in used the same. I don't if it was the product I received but it wasn't as comfortable as I remembered in the hotel and after few washes, the comfort level started to plunge as the feathers started to poke. I won't spend my money on this ever again!"
negative,"""Truth"": The characters in Berry's novel seem to be computer generated, as does the story itself. Once again, the evil Catholic Church has hidden the ""truth"" from a blind & stupid laity, who must be recued by the liberal elite. Those priests, bishops & nuns who have failed to live up to their vows due to their exclusive knowledge of what ""Truth"" is, i.e. ""situational"".Berry quotes extensively from scripture in this piece of work. He even quotes a scripture that makes his whole story just plain silly. ""What you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven & what you bind on earth, will be bound in heaven."" Guess he overlooked that one because, after all, most of us loyal to the Church, are too dumb & blind to ""catch it"". I'm an old woman now, so I'll just stick to my ongoing conversations with Jesus through the Eucharist, the rosary, & just plain ""listening"". By the way Steve, Jesus loves you...but, He's not too fond of the way you presented His Mother.Kathleen RineyTroy, Tx."
negative,"It ain't The Exorcist...: Don't bother with Rosemary's Baby. Don't watch it unless you are really bored on a rainy day. The film is so slow-paced and dated; 20 minutes in to the film I was looking at my watch to see how much longer I'd have to suffer. It finally ended and I let out a long sigh of relief! It is SO boring, you'll just go crazy! Please, for the love of goodness see the infinitely superior The Exorcist instead of this turkey any day of the week."
negative,Spider-man 2 umd movie for psp: the movie would not work in my new psp. stated on the package that is wasnt for resell. will not buy item from seller again
positive,"Very Moving Reading...: ...especially if you know someone who was in WWII. I bought a copy for my father - a retired AF Colonel, who was in WWII. We had the distinct pleasure of meeting Tom Brokaw at the VFW in South Dakota in Nov. 1998 as he toured the country looking for vets whose stories he could share on his television special in Jan. 1999. If you could have seen the look in my father's eyes as he relived some of his best and worst memories. If only I could have had an autographed copy of the book. I will settle for a picture of my father and me as we talked with Tom about his days growing up in So Dakota and his love for the brave soldiers that worked so hard to maintain the freedoms for all of us. God Bless you all.....all of you who have ever been to battle. Only you can know it's horror. Our thanks is all we have to offer."
negative,cold blanket: i was enthralled with this when i first got it but the ice does not last that long and the rectangles are prone to breaking. great idea but not sturdy at all.
negative,"Kodak Easy Share DX7590 camera: I bought this camera for my daughter for her to take pictures of the kids and send them to me. She recently moved 1,000 miles away.I wanted for her to have a reliable camera. The camera came with the wrong battery but she thought that it was the old battery and needed replacement. She wanted to take pictures right away so she searched around the city and found a charger but that battery still did not work.She finally purchased another battery on line for the camera and when it arrived it was a different battery. The camera was sold with the wrong battery.I emailed the seller and we came up with an adjusted price. He was going to make an adjustment in my Amazon account but I am not sure if it has happened yet.My daughter is very happy with the camera. I feel bad that she had to run around so much to mqke a gift work."
positive,"Not your run-of-the-mill Black Beauty reprise!: This book is just beautiful - a stunningly emotional story, and one of the best horse stories I've ever read (even over Misty of Chincoteague). Everything weaves together flawlessly and your sympathies flow freely. Yes, the horse inevitably is abused and unappreciated - a staple in horse stories - but in the end it is a wonderfully uplifting, beautiful story. This book is without a doubt a quintessential childhood book."
negative,"Garbage Movie.. 0 Stars: 1st. off being a very big Martial Arts fan this movie doesn't even come in the same category as a Martial Arts Movie, the reason it hasn't been released so far is because the Movie Sucked Big Time. Conan Lee was in this movie which is the reason I went to see it when it 1st. came out and he gets killed within 10minutes of the movie. So don't even waste your time or money to buy this. I had to give this 1 star because it doesn't have a 0-Star rating."
positive,"Most Helpful Book on Bible Interpretation that I have found: I've read many books on understanding the Bible, from What the Bible is All About by Henrietta C. Mears, which definitely whetted my appetite. To Introduction to bibleical Interpretation by W.W. Klein, C. L blomberg & R. L. Hubbard, Jr. and The hermeneutical Spiral by Grant R. Osborn all of which have helpful ideas in them.But Grasping God's Word has been the most helpful. As a person without a college education this book has led me step by step to understanding and applying the Bible.I especially like the part where they stake you step by step from understanding the likenesses and differences from back then to similar situations in the here and now.Thank you J. Scott Duvall, and j. Daniel Hays for doing such a great job."
negative,"DISGUSTING: AHHH, after reading the Dying Earth by Jack Vance isn't this a letdown!!!My grandma gave this to me on my 13th birthday, and i've barely finished half and it's about time i've finally gotten rid of this dumb thing. The characterizations are bad, the plot tedious and the whole book can be summarized sitting in the middle of an ocean listening to doldrums and eels nip out your eyes."
positive,"A whole lot of fun to get scared by this book: Ulrich Karger tells hier a wonderful, sensitive picture book story. It captures the children's world with a lot of understanding and warm-hearted humor and, as long as the lights remain on, shows how to overcome the fear of a sleepover away from home. Uli Waas' wonderful illustrations enhance the story with a lot of charm. I am sheer enthused about it and can recommend it to children, parents, nursery school libraries and teachers."
negative,dis movie SSUUCCKKSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: i see dis movie in dis theter it blew chunks spongbob an his friends are gay
negative,"horrible translation of a great story: I brought the first two volume of this translation. What a complete waste of money. The chinese story is funny, vivid, and full of life. However, this translation sucks all the complexity, life, and wonder from the story. If there were only this translation, no one would care about this story. For those who are only able to know about this chinese story from this translation, they will never understand that this was Jin Yong's (Louis Cha) last and perhaps, greatest novel.It's just really sad that because of this translation, no one else will now do a real translation of this great story in english."
positive,"Love this Music: This is my favorite Enya music for a long time. I enjoy all her sounds, but this album is special. It's really her best for a long time. I recommend this CD."
positive,"DeShawn Days: Tony Medina shares his inner city neighborhood with lively verse, a sense of humor and a tender heart. Reaching out to his young audience, Medina's story inspires joy and compassion without being the least bit didactic.R. Gregory Christie's energetic paintings celebrate De Shawn's world with sensitivity and passion. Bravo, this book is a gem."
negative,"Love the movie, not the previews...: First and foremost: Babe is one of my favorite movies.If you haven't seen it, you're missing out.But this movie has ""coming attractions"", previews that cannot be skipped. Granted, they're only a few minutes long. But you have to watch them each and every time you play the disk. No skipping to the title menu.If there were other versions available, I'd buy them.Hey studios: Ineffective marketing tool. Next time I'll research before I buy, and won't buy a movie with forced previews."
positive,Joseph an dthe Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat: Was very please with the product and the timely fashion in which it arrived.
positive,"Great Bargain: The Pampers were a great bargain for the price! I wish they actually worked closer to the ""up to 12 hours"" promise... I really wanted them to help get through the night with my 16 month old, because her diaper ends up leaking around 4 hours into it.. So I still have to continue to wake her up in the middle of the night to change her. Which sometimes can be a HORRIBLE task! I do feel that they have the best fit for the size though.. Overall, I would definitely buy this brand and this ""economy Pack"" again! Good Deal!"

positive,Pampers are Perfect: I love Pampers Baby Dry. I've tried other brands but nothing compared. These are soft and hold up well for long periods of time (12 hours overnight). Highly reccomend!
negative,"Incompleate order: I ordered this book and it was supposed to came with a CD-Room, but I did not reiceived it. I sent an email to consumer services and called up and they never answer. However, I received the book in the stipulated time but for most of the activities you need the CD."
negative,POOR LENS!: I purchased this tele converter lens as an add on to my Canon PowerShot S60. Boy was I disappointed. Let me first say that you first have to purchase an adapter to use this lens with my model (S60). Not a big deal since the adapter wasn't too expensive. The bad news is that the lens and adapter do not feel secure. As far as performance....the lens does what is says (brings in the shot 2X). However the images taken with the lens are terrible. The lens feels bulky and leaves a dark spot in the lower right hand corner of all images taken with the lens on. Do not purchase this lens. Stick with the built in digital zoom instead and don't waste your money.
positive,"Great value - now: These once cost nearly $3000, but I got my z557 for about 1/15th of that. I've had it for over six months and used it for radio, TV, DVD movies, Internet video (full-screen HD) and general computing. With 2GB of RAM and Vista Ultimate, it actually runs really well. My keyboard isn't as bad as what was written about, here, but it is not the kind of keyboard you would use for more than surfing, anyway. And, it will take any USB keyboard or keyboard/mouse, wireless, or otherwise. I'd recommend using a wired LAN instead of its weak wireless. And, it can seem like it's running hot, but that hasn't turned out to be a problem. If you have the room, it's a decent all-around system, looks good and is nicely built."
negative,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Pretty violent, and I did not appreciate the strong language (cursing). Not suitable for my four year old to watch."
negative,"Low Quality: I make a very large mug of Tea in the morning. By the time I finish it, it is usually cold. I bought this thinking that it would allow me to have hot tea all morning.When I first got it the heat output was not too bad, it would keep something warm but wouldn't heat up something cold. That is for the 2 days it worked. Thats right, it only took 2 days before it gave out. Now it does not heat up at all. I have learned my lesson, buy a thermos."
positive,"I love this album...: ...becauseI love the sound of Clay's voiceI love the passion that comes through his music - it is clear that he feels what the songwriter feltI love that the songs are complex and intelligent - not some coked-out-can't-handle-more-than-10-words-in-the-lyric-or-I-lose-attention-deficit-syndrome musicI love that soaring, wonderful, lusty voiceI love that I find myself dancing in my chair/car/home while I'm feeling the musicI love that I don't have to listen to the ""Thanks, but I've already heard them a million times and I'm tired of them"" oldies to hear music that makes me want to sing alongI love Clay's spirit and scruples and sexinessI love that Clay fulfills a need that the music industry has been lacking for the last several yearsI love his voiceClay makes any song he sings sound better.If you need more reasons, I can give them...."
positive,Just what I wanted: I have been looking for this CD for a while. Just what I wanted in perfect condition.
negative,"Alright- Not that good: Understood classic by others, but it bored me. Then again, I had to read this for school. I found it to lack in a real plot. I am a fan of Charles Dickens but this one was not good."
positive,"Different label, same music.: Ghost's fourth solo project, but the first he would be releasing on Def Jam. Ghost returns to prove all the doubters wrong and come out with the intense, raw and emotional styles of rap that we all came to recognise over a decade ago. Ghost's rapping hasn't changed much during his absense in the rap, I feel Ghost only improves with age, with cuts like ""Biscuits"" and ""Metal Lungies"", Ghost seems more hungry than ever to go head-to-head with the best of 'em. With cuts like ""Save Me Dear"", Ghost shows his love for women. Also Ghost comes back to takeover the club jams with ""Tush"" featured with ""Missy Elliot"". Also RZA shows up for ""Run"" with Jadakiss. The album shows Ghost leading the Wu-Tang to the right direction and sooner or later they will be back to smash the world!"
negative,"Feels like a commercial...: All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK, but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.*sigh*"
positive,"Recalled Fondly While Discussing Royal Navy History: I was discussing Royal Navy history with a British friend who was recommending a number of books about the topic, and I recalled reading MacLean's HMS Ulysses perhap five times as a teenager 35 years ago. He had never heard of the book, though he was familiar with the author.I commended the title to him, and have since re-read it myself. It remains one of the most fraught and depressing, but extraordinarily compelling, novels of naval warfare I've read. MacLean's character development - like the detail and minutiae of the wartime nautical world on the Murmansk run - is intense and complete, even as the characters die from the myriad perils that surround them.This is an epic story of men's ability to endure, the indifference of the sea and the weather, and the stark cruellty of war."
negative,"The Greatest Generation: Although the subject matter is excellent, as are the stories, the editing is very poor. Editing in such a way as the tape ends in the middle of a story is uncalled for in this day and age.Brokaw needs to understand words beginning with an x are sounded as if starting with a z. Thus, Xavier University is pronounced as ""Zavier"" and not ""Exavier."" For a professional, this is simply unacceptable."
positive,"You want variety?: With her throaty sounds in ""opinion #33"", make-you-get-up-and-dance rhythm in ""My Baby"" and the wonderful proclamation borrowed from Harvey Fierstein in ""grass for the lambs"", you cannot miss with this latest contribution to the earth from SONiA. Oh, and if you're having a bad day, crank up ""turtle flowers"" complete with the opening and closing conversations between SONiA and Dylan V. It heals my soul with each listen."
negative,"Von Richtofen & brown: This movie was not very good. It seemed like a low budget made for 3rd world TV production. The planes were hoaky and most were the wrong type for the time periods portrayed in the story. The story of the Red Baron was incorrect as well, and the ending was totally wrong. For a movie about history it was way off base."
negative,"A lousy edition of a great book: I bought this book because I had worn out a previous copy from several re-readings. Needless to say, the book is worth reading, but I strongly suggest obtaining a different edition from this one. The production quality of this book is zero! Multiple typos in just the first 5 pages, a clumsy typeface, sloppy spacing -- obviously somebody just printed out a poorly produced text document that had never been proofread. I have given the book to a resale shop because it was so bad that I couldn't stand to read it."
negative,waist of money: it only works on old windows programs whitch i dont know anyone that still has it so there for it was a waste of my tome and money
negative,"It just didn't do it for me: Hearing about the book Dreamcatcher from my friends, I assumed it was a great read and I look forward to reading it before ever opening it. After the first six chapters, the book was really boring me. If it weren't for the fact I had to write a book report on Dreamcatcher for my class, I would have quit reading it right away. A couple of parts were interesting, but the alien conflict was little to none. I guess you could say Stephen King caught the wrong dream to write about this time."
positive,"THE MOST BADASS BAND ON THE PLANET!!!!!: THESE GUYS JUST GET EVEN MORE DIRTIER, NASTIER, HORNIER, DRUNKER, AND JUST PLAIN F$#%ING GROSSER EACH ALBUM!!!!!

I PLAY THIS ALL THE TIME MY GIRLFRIEND COMES OVER, AND BELIEVE IT SHE WANTS ME TO SAY SOMETHING DIRTY!!!!!!!!"
positive,"A picture book with great photos and interesting historical: This picture book has very colorful photos of our country and our fellow citizens. The pages are spread by the breaks in text that we know from reciting the pledge orally at school. Children are from different races. Scenes from all over America and even an astronaut on the moon holding the American flag are depicted.In the back there are small photos that were depicted in the book with explanations about where they are and other factual information to explain the contents of the photographs. The entire pledge is rewritten in the back pages and an explanation of who wrote it, why, and when. The meaning of why we recite the pledge is given. Facts about the American flag's changes over the years and facts about the proper way to display a flag, and on what days, are included.A beautiful book with great information that every child should be exposed to."
negative,The Duke saves it: I found the film was poorly directed and photographed. It didnt have a good flow to it. The Duke saves an otherwise poor movie.
positive,Great Movie: We have it on VHS but wanted it on DVD. It is a funny family movie. We can watch it over and over.
positive,"Great after positioned right!: I got this today. As I was putting the 3 AA batteries in I had to try it out. I have a high sitting clit and the clit vib part had to be positioned right. Once I got it positioned right I was in heaven. I had the big ""O"" in a minute (probably under) and it was so intense I was shaking. The buttons were easy to manage once you got the position right. I don't think I will try this in the water since other reviewers have and the toy wouldn't work after. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great toy. My husband is looking forward to using this on me tonight since telling him how amazing it is."
positive,"Riding in Cars or Boats with Kids: .Tom Bodett - the ""We'll leave the light on"" Motel 6 guy - wrote and performs this cautionary tale of respect for the whims of Nature for kids and their parents. Part ""slice of life"" in the Alaskan ""bush,"" part sociology - can ""bush"" and ""town"" kids find common ground and interests? and also a warning on why kids should listen to grown-ups (all these years and we really HAVE learned something ;-), this captivating adventure will while away the hours whilst travelling."
positive,"love it: The amount of heat it gives to your drink definitely depends on the glass, and whether you have a lid.One day I had a relatively flat-surfaced mug with a plastic lid on top. It kept it so hot after about 5 hours that I couldn't even drink it quickly!"
negative,Fair...but....: This book has a good story concept and Dickens writes well...but the story would have been alot better had he not been paid by the word. His lengthy descriptions of mundane tasks serve to break the pacing of a novel that already barely dredges along.
positive,"Great Story! Anne & Mary Boleyn are the best!: I loved this book & actually finished it in less than a week! I understand that people feel very strongly about Anne Boleyn, but I just want to stress that this book is NOT supposed a history book! I think we can imagine that certain conversations may have gone the way that Gregory described, and others, of course, were different. I loved the story, and Gregory's writing was mature, but also, easy to get through (with maximum comprehension). I can't get over how ruthless Anne was, but the love between sisters (and family) was so strong - I just loved this story!"
negative,"Good beginning, bad ending: This book's first chapter was good. It explained the complete history of Airedales. However, past page 32, they did not even mention ""Airedale"" (it was only written in the captions). There were Airedale pictures throughout, but they ended in the middle of the book. The rest seemed like an advertisement for Nylabone. In conclusion, if you are looking for a breed specific book about Airedales, I would not suggest buying this book."
negative,"SECOND and LAST time around for Sandisk e series: This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player. The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months. I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280. I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of ""reading"" and then back to the Sandisk logo screen. It will do that for hours and hours on end. My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off. The only Sansa product I've ever loved was the discontinued M series players -they're few and far between and highly sought after."
positive,"One of the greatest books ever: I love this book and have read it many times. Probably one of Mark Twain's best. Even though it was written a long time ago, it is very modern in its approach."
positive,"Great Game.... :): This is a game everyone should play, great storyline, great graphics, and REALLY fun! I am proud to own the game and I reccommend it to about everyone!"
positive,A must for your baby...: I just have to say that if you have a baby or know someone that does this is the item for you. It is the perfect item to wrap your baby in to feel secure. We used to use a cloth diaper to wrap up the baby years ago but now they have come up with this and it's perfect. Get a few of them you won't want to be without it.
negative,Didn't send the penguin classic. Different cover. SO lame!: I was expecting the book in the picture but what I received was a solid blue covered version. Would not go through this seller again.
negative,"Its OK: I'm used to better quality mysteries.....just wanted to read a ""classic"" and I wasn't impressed. It was worth reading, I suppose, but I won't read it again..."
positive,"A Different View: For anybody who loves Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock boxset and wants even more film document of this mecca, then this is it. D.A.Pennebaker (Monterey Pop Festival) and Chris Hegedus to a great job directing this documentary of three days of peace and music and presenting the music in order as it happened. There are a few quick shots and longer cuts of festival goers that were in the Wadleigh film but it blends in well to this 3 hour film. I highly recommend this documentary from this historical landmark event of 1969."
negative,not up to her standards: not nearly as good as her usual work if your hoping to hear her forget it it is a pale comparison with authors who don't have her style
positive,Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: The Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump is a amazing purchase comparing price and quality.
positive,"This book is very helpful to a beginer like me: I got this book as a present from my brother and I loved it. It is so help. It tells you the correct brushes and tool needed for the right application. It has a great section on trying to figure out what shape of face you have, what tone is your face and the type of face you have. I really recommend getting this book, especially if your a beginer."
positive,"Excellent: The book gives a thorough discussion on the PRACTICAL implementation of the Transactional Ananlysis ""I am OK, You are OK"" theory.It is therefore a must read if you are into Transaction Analysis or you just want to imporve your leadership skill.Please remember to come back to give this review a vote after you have purchased the book and have read it form cover to cover.P."
negative,"ZERO stars: I wish there was a way I could give this ZERO stars. The quality is awful. The ""satin"" looks like pleather and the feel is disgustingly cheap.It also does not fit true to size. According to measurements, I fit into a size large. Apparently the tape measure they have at the factory is not the same as mine.Now, I'm stuck with having to find a dress in less than a month."

positive,enjoyable read: I remember reading this book when it was first published in hard cover. I bought it for my kindle.Tough the book was written at the height of the cold war.
negative,Poor: Love MMA is the only reason I didn't give it one star. Poor acting. In the the top 5 of the worst movies I have had the misery of watching.
negative,"WARNING: NOT 3-D: I ordered this because I love 3-D movies. Even terrible movies are more fun with the paper glasses.I was hugely disappointed when I opened the DVD case and found nothing but a disk. No 3-D glasses. The DVD is not 3-D. Just a flattened-out version of the ultra-cool movie I remember from the theater.So if you want a good 3-D movie, this isn't it. If you want a good horror movie, well, it's the second sequel to a decent horror movie. When has a second sequel ever been any good? Only when it was in 3-D"
negative,Bad purchase: This is not a very good toy. Sometimes it catches and works but mostly not. Should of listened to reviews. They were right.
negative,"NO 3-D: As a collector of 3-D movies that really work, this one is a total rip off!! Do not waste your time or money if you expect a 3-D experience. Movie was a bit out of focus, no viewing glasses included what so ever, and did not even work with any of the many different types of 3-D glasses that I own. Was not even worth the bother of returning it, so I threw it in the trash, do not believe everything you read! This DVD was totally misleading in its description.BEWARE!!!"
negative,"just plain horrible: Definitely the worst game of the MK series. This one is not worth even this low price. Save your time and money and play a real game like Metal Gear instead. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer, MKM was a masterpiece compared to this."
positive,"Excellence: A superb and convincing acting job by Russel Crowe, well detailed and executed action sequences along with a strong plot and story created an emotional movie succeding that of Titanic and Armageddon combined helped produce the correct recipe for the best movie of the year. A great movie to see whether it is your 4th time or first. (Important note: If you have not seen gladiator yet, GO SEE IT A.S.A.P.)"
positive,"A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SAILOR: Great book, easy to read, you do not have to be an expert to read it. A must have for any sailor even if he/she is not a cruiser. Jim Howard deals with all the aspects of cruising under sail with a lot of common sence and safety. If you are a ""wannabe"" cruiser this book is of great help to organize your dream."
positive,"A haunting insight into the prevailance of injustice: At first this was just one of those books assigned to read during tenth grade English. The sheer immediacy of the tale changed that. This book is philosophical to the hilt, questioning the general concept of reality itself. The reader begins to mistrust everything, especially government rule and its version of justice. A true revolutionary novel and one of the best written, ever, hands down."
negative,"LIES, LIES, LIES........ Bethune's con game!: YES, The airline was turned around,, but continental employees are the LOWEST paid in the industry! He insults FAs by considering them outcasts,,, DO YOU REALIZE they are the ONLY group at CONTINENTAL AIRLINES that does NOT get holiday pay? They have to be AWAY from family and friends, YET they are paid like it was any other day while other employee groups enjoy HOLIDAY PAY. THERE IS ALOT THIS BOOK COVERS UP AND SUGAR COATS. This book is the equal of a badly written AESOP FABLE. LET the readers talk to the FAs, ground staff, etc. Let the public see your salary and the under industry standard rates you pay the employees."
positive,Charger works great: The charger works fine as advertised. The location of the of the charger inlet on the phone itself is not very good - makes it awkward if you are charging and trying to talk.
positive,"A good edition of a good remake: In this edition of Night 90, you get a great behind the scenes feature which includes a few deleted scenes. These scenes all are deleted head shots that the MPAA forced Tom Savini to remove from the film for being to graphic. They said that if Savini had not removed those head shots, the film would have gotten an X rating instead of an R rating."
positive,"this book is a treasure!: I have looked for this book for years! I read it as a child, checked it out in Boston, and never forgot how much I loved it. I am so happy to hear that others loved it just as much. I remember the drawings as well, they were beautiful black and white ink. This book is about LOVE. Please bring it back into print."
positive,pipi: What can I say that hasen't already been said.This is the classic movie of the Normandy invasion.A must see for everyone.
positive,Came quick: Clean book. Showed up to my door on time. The book was nice and cheap. Please buy stuff from these people.
positive,"Bubble Gum Crisis: This music CD went along fairly well with the action and theme seen in the show, Bubble Gum Crisis. I guess that kind of figures, as it's the sound track for the show, but it was very good. I'm not a music critic, but that is my opinion. If you were a fan of the show, this CD is a must-have."
negative,"Not my taste: I did not like the texture/material. The fitting was also loose for me. Having used Eddie Bauer cotton shirts, these shirts were disappointment."
negative,"The Z-strap is not great...: I love Skecher's shoes for my boys...they seem to withstand the beatings that the boys can dish out. But I bought these for my 2nd son for his ""back to school"" shoes since they were on sale, they were not laced shoes, and they were not white. He only wore them for 2 months before he was complaining on a daily basis that he couldn't get them ""tight"". After a week of this, I did look at them and he was right, the straps had started unraveling at the metal grommets, then they would get bound up in one spot instead of laying flat. We ended up buying him a new pair of Stride Rites at an outlet and he's been wearing those instead. We'll keep buying Skechers, but will definitely stay away from the ""Z-strap"" enclosures."
positive,"Magical, Mystical and Wonderful: This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it before it was made into a movie, and few books have touched me heart, soul and mind so completely.Hoffman has a great gift for weaving magic into her storytelling, quite literally. If you like kindness, empathy, and humanity in your supernatural tales, this is the book for you. The realism and everyday sincerity of this book is well represented by the term ""Practical Magic"".If your child loves Harry Potter and you've developed a taste for witchcraft and magic, you MUST read this book. You'll fall in love."
positive,"A Good Summer Read: Due to my long hours during the school year as a school teacher, I find it relaxing to save most of my books for the summer to read. I decided to read this over the summer and it only took me about 5 days(I have a 1-year old) to read. This was a great book. I enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone(male or female) who likes reading about our lives and situations. I was able to find a character that I could relate to."
positive,"It's hard to stop reading this one: ""Love's Second Sight"" is a great, imaginative story based on stanzas contained in medieval Icelandic texts ""The Vinland Saga, the ""Greenlander's Aga"" and ""Saga of Erik the Red.""Thorgunna must rule an island as a woman in an era where men are in charge. At the same time, she is agonized by Loki, the God of Lies -- trapped between the old gods and the Christ.It's easy to see why this book has garnered so many great reviews. There is top-notch writing throughout, a compelling storyline and an ending that will have your heart pounding. I will look forward to more from Darragha Foster. Recommended."
positive,"[Howl!]: A friend of mine played this in the car... the next day I was humming one of the tunes, the day after that I bought it. I played it probably 3 times daily for the first two weeks, and here it is a couple months later and I'm not even close to being tired of it yet. If you just read the lyrics, there are some really depressing and downright nasty themes here (sandwiched between humorous stuff)... but the music is just so fantastic and so full of energy, it just picks you up and carries you along at about mach 2."
positive,"Race To mars: very realistic and fantastic movie, a must for all mars enthusiests like me. Great graphics and The planet just aches out for me to be on and explore"
positive,good disc: i really like her voice& the music hits it's point on this set.Constant Craving was a really good song.she can write good Lyrics.a good disc through out.
positive,"GREAT!: This book helped me a great deal, when I was ready, to deal with my anger problem. Realizing that I had a problem was the first step. The authors take you through steps that really opened my eyes and made me aware of my choices. I love the spiritual aspects!"
negative,"WORST WALL PHONE & CALLER ID SETUPS: Beside the most flimsy body, the info booklet does not tell how to reset the time or caller-ID setup procedure. This is probably the worst Bell Telephone production I have seen so far."
positive,"go with the view: I was upgrading from a Sandisk Sansa e280 4GB unit. This unit does a better job playing everything (audio and videos) and with a larger screen and longer battery life, I was sold. I think this unit is a great option if you want to avoid ipod and itunes."
positive,"Not Yuck: This was a complex story with good charecters, an impressive plot, and an amazing world. Any body who can't understand it as little vocabulary, I.Q., and paitence."
negative,"Sounds Great, but lasted only 2.5 months.: Great sounding earbuds, but after only 2.5 months became staticy and distorted. Thankfully, Amazon took them back. Great Company!"
negative,"Not Good: I did not laugh once during this so-called comedy, and I like a lot of British humor and black comedy. It's not that I didn't get it. I just thought it was tasteless and boring. The production looked cheap."
positive,"A true inspiration...: This book is a great read!With simple language that helps you get closer to the characters, and the inpiring goals that make you reflect in your own life!Truely one of the few books that could change your life for ever :)"
positive,"The Other Boleyn Girl: great read! If you enjoy historical fiction, and have any interest at all in getting behind the scenes of the pomp and venality of the British court in pre-Elizabethan England, then this is a must. The book rounds out some curious aspects of Henry's six marriages not found in most history texts. It gives a sense of the gossip that was the currency of the court, among the men and women - which she of course is imagining - but which provides context and a fuller view of the mores of the time. Also, I had no idea that another Boleyn daughter existed beyond Anne, and never grasped the position her family (the Howards) held at court, or the effects their rivalry with the Seymours had on their choices. Adjunct reading: Lady Antonia Fraser's ""The Wives of Henry VIII."" Also check web for more info and pictures of these women."
negative,"Julie and Julia: I was very unimpressed by this book. In this case, the movie WAS so much better. The language and subjects talked about in the book were very offensive. The only reason I finished the book was because I payed ten dollars for it and I was past the two-week return date."
negative,"Historical Fiction, not legal suspense: In this novel John Grisham has created an in depth and fascinating study of a small southern town and all its characters, tracking their growth and development over time. He details food, customs, race relations and politics. However, that is most definitely not what I wanted from a Grisham novel with a legal title. I wanted suspense and thrill. This dragged on with Michner-like detail providing occasional clues to the secondary legal plot while chronicling history. The denoument was highly anticlimactic. Read it for lovely historical fiction, but not if you want hardhitting, riveting thrilling suspense."
negative,"Disappointing: This is one of the most disappointing book of short stories I have read in a long time. The characters are shallow, boring and forgettable. The book has a section called ""Three Stories"", describing different times in the lives of the same characters. The character development, however, was so shallow, that I didn't realize I was reading about the same people until I noticed that I was seeing the same (unusual) name, Galen, so many times. Ms. Bloom tries to add surprises to each story. Since I couldn't identify or empathize with the characters, the surprises were just an author trying to add oomph to an otherwise dull story."
positive,A great read and wonderful for all ages.: I am a avid fantasy reader and I loved this book. It catches the imagination of the reader so well and keeps you interested throughout the entire book. It is a great book and I would recommend it to readers of all ages.
positive,"Looking at a future that is now past: I greatly enjoyed this audio book, partly because the narrator's vocal gifts brought alive the various characters and thier accents. I also enjoyed revisitng a book that I had read long ago, in the earlry years of my life. I now was able to see more clearly the fears inspired by the Communist party in post-war Eastern Europe and China, and how those events inspired Orwell's writing of this book and the reactions of his audience."
negative,"not too clean: not very believable, not very entertaining, comon, even dogs and cats groom themselves, watch the beginning of 2001 for just 25 min and save yourself some time."
positive,"This Is Batman!: Batman, like the Phoenix, has risen from the ashes and has returned with 'Batman Begins'. This movie is truly amazing and is never dull. I have seen this film many times and it is just as fresh and just as exciting as it was when I watched it for the first time.Christian Bale has taken Batman and made it his own. I didn't think anyone could top Michael Keaton's performance as the dark knight, but I was wrong. The entire film in itself is truly unbelievable. I wasn't that big of a fan of Ra's Al Ghoul before this movie, but he was the best villain for it. Cillian Murphey was also the perfect choice for Scarecrow. Overall, everyone was right for who they portrayed in the movie.Let's not forget the locations that we see in this movie. All truly breath taking. Batman fans rejoice! This is a movie that is not something you should miss. Every single person owes it to themselves to see this movie. One of the best movies of last year."
negative,"I think I had a worse textbook once, ten years ago: The excessive reliance on ML and poor language skills exhibited are well covered in the other reviews. I'd just like to add that Mitchell has a terrible habit of explaining things out of order (for instance, activation records are explained on page 165, but you are expected to know them on page 148), and his ""This is beyond the scope of this book."" handwaving makes many of the explanations completely incoherent.I have never sold back a textbook before, but I'm taking this back to the bookstore right after my final, and then I'll get a real Comparative Programming Languages textbook."
negative,"Fun, but historically innacurate: Unlike Mr Orwell apparently, I can actually remember 1984 and believe you me some of his recollections of the era are well off the mark. There were no such things as Memory Holes, was no such country as Eurasia and Big Brother did not hit our screens until 1999. I also find it staggering that there was no mention of Rubiks Cubes or the film Spies Like Us. On the other hand I did approve of some of the stricter measures bought in to promote sensible behaviour in the office which were advocated in this book."
positive,Great book: As an Economics major in college this book is extremely useful must read for those entering business of all types.
negative,"May not appeal to toddler: My 3-year old toddler loved playing ""snatch-the-toast"" from her toy toaster so I bought her the crocodile dentist. However, she is scared stiff of the clamping action and refused to play with it. She started removing the sticker-eyes and -nostrils instead. Toy is durable per se but stickers can be easily removed. I had to glue them back with superglue, which is better lasting. I came to a conclusion that she is still too young to play with the crocodile dentist and I intend to keep it for her later on."
negative,"Highly overrated: It is extremely meandering and never seems to end. It's all about atmosphere and erotic cool and Prague, etc., but at some point a car chase would really liven things up. How about some more nipples? Throw a pie in Juliet Binoche's face? Anything! Just stop wandering around, muttering to yourself like a half-wit.Perhaps I don't get it, but I don't get syphillis either and I'm the better for it. Where's your witty rejoinder to that?!A real test of patience, this film."
negative,"Bad Deal!!: I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future."
negative,"Intriguing but EXTREMELY disappointing.: The Third Secret follows the typical suspense/thriller model. It is adequately interesting to keep one reading. The early pages filled with interesting bits of information about the Vatican's history. However, (And I won't give away the secret) at about page 350, the book takes a dive. Steve Berry apparently thinks that no one will object when he shoves in his personal views on divisive church issues. But whether you agree with him or not, the revelation is completely unwarranted. I suppose Berry was trying to set his religious thriller in the same vein as Dan Brown's ""heretical"" books. In the end the book devolves into a treastise of Berry's personal views, presented in a way that debate is impossible. That added to the absolutely deplorable behavior by the story's protagonists (which Berry makes no attempt to challenge) makes this book a disappointing read at best."
positive,"Very convenient and easy: I bought this to stay in my daughters dorm room where space is limited and it worked great. Don't need a pump its all built in. Stayed 5 nights and added air with the flick of a switch, I like it very firm. Would buy another if needed."
positive,"This movie was awesome!: This movie was very moving, because it showed the lengths to which our men went to make freedom possible for everyone! My favorite actor in this movie was Roddy Mcdowall (Private Morris) he is the BEST actor ever, he did not apear in this movie alot, but the little bit that he was there, he made that small part seem so large, and it just capyures the eye of the beholder, although he is not with us anymore, he is entertaining angels in heaven, we will all miss him!"
positive,"A cute movie that you and your kids will enjoy! :-): You have kids.You're kids like to read stories (and watch movies) 1,000 of times over and over and over............If ya gotta watch a story several time, this movie is a sure-winner. There's lots of things in here for both parents and kids.:-)"
positive,"Lovely Book: I find the book very interesting and entertaining. I find all of the characters quite amusing, especially Bilbo Baggins. I didn't dislike anything about it , although I don't know what half the words mean, but that can be overlooked. One of the best so far that I have read!"
positive,"Interesting reading: An interesting book about the devastating effect rumors can have, in this case on a 1940s Johns Hopkins medical student and my uncle."
negative,cookie cutter pop-punk: unoriginal top 40... think the pop punk thing has just about run its course if this is the best stuff out there.
positive,Great Smoke Taste: Hickory is my favorite and that is what I use the most in smoking my meats. With Bradley Bisquettes does gives a lot of smoke and add flavor to the meats. I am never disappointed with Bradley Briquettes!
positive,"Simple fun stress relief: This is definitely an arcade-type game. It has simple left-right steering controls, accelerate, brake, etc. It is shameless Harley Davidson promotion with H-D road signs showing up every mile or so, and cheesy 80's rock (Poison, I think), but is a LOT OF FUN.You can ride up to your opponents, kick them off their bikes, hit turbo boost to go really fast, and you gain points to buy better bikes and equipment.After playing so many ""simulators"" out there which just succeed in making me more tired after a long work day, this is simple, relaxing fun. Rock on!"
positive,"Not so much action, but still satisfying.: Yes, it's true there is a bit more description of the rights of English landlords in the nineteenth century than I would have liked. There is less actual sailing than in previous books, so this volume doesn't have the sense of motion that O'Brian portrays so well. Yet this remains a fascinating book. True to form, O'Brian describes life in it's nitty-gritty detail, whether it's the horrendous personal violence of Bonden's boxing match, or the consequences of Jack's infidelity, yet the eloquence of his description and the sympathy for the characters that O'Brian evokes keeps the reader deeply involved. It's not as much of an adventure story as previous books, yet there is an agreeable sense of community and familiarity when all the characters are staying with one another on land. And of course the ending makes you want to read the next one immediately."
negative,"Rollerball ROCKED In Theatres,...: ""Rollerball"" in theatres was an awesome, bone-crunching, action-packed movie! But once it got on video & DVD...they added in nudity & took out scenes. It was terrible. The camera work was even altered when it came on video. I wouldn't have mind if they at least put the theatrical version on video too... bet they didn't! WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TRANFERED THE FILM?"
positive,Very Pleased: Item was complete and new in box as advertised. Instruction manual was 67 pages and because I was replacing an existing broken icemaker did not apply.Seller was very easy to do business with.
positive,"Best telling of Shakespeare's tragic tale: Franco Zeffirelli's production of ""Romeo & Juliet"" is my absolute favorite Shakespearean film. Zeffirelli's daring casting of teenagers Len Whiting and Olivia Hussey in the title roles is perfect in the context of the play of two star-crossed teen lovers. Another ideal casting choice was Michael York as Juliet's cousin, Tybalt. York brings a particular venom to the role, all the while revealing his skill and training as a fencer and former member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. The film is also visually quite beautiful, with outstanding cinematography and scenery. I have seen numerous productions of ""Romeo & Juliet"" on stage and screen, and this one surpasses all of them."
positive,"a great toy: We own two of these (different frequencies so we can race them) and have given them as gifts. They are a ton of fun (for kids & their jealous parents). We have had them two years - they work great - are easy to control, never tip (although our pond does not have waves), have great range & are durable. My son loved them when we got them when he was five & still loves them at 7 (as do his friends). With new batteries they run for a long time. I hate toy boats/cars/planes that run on rechargable batteries - where you have to constantly charge them for hours at a time only to find that they run out of juice fast (15 minutes of use time) and suddenly (usually when boat is in middle of lake). No such problem with these boats. Overall, these boat were great. I would hightly recommend them to anyone."
negative,"Missing tape: I was planning to use this audio for a reading class. It is a pretty big set of DVD's and DVD #1 is missing. I contacted the dealer and got no resolution. I just wanted the first DVD, or a new set, but it was his only one. It was sealed so it had to be originally packaged with that DVD missing."
negative,"Terribly elusive.: ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" is poorly advertised. If you're expecting a novel filled with accounts of the Salem Witch Trials, like I thought, you're wrong. It is not until almost 200 pages into the book will the subject be touched upon, and then gingerly dropped. Much of the writing is fillers and dribble; this book could have been 100 pages shorter. I didn't care for any of the characters, and all of them were typecast. The angry, strict Uncle, the caring, soft-spoken Aunt, two cousins - one being the flirt and one being sweet. And, of course, the outcast niece. I was very disappointed, as I had my sights set on a captivating Salem Witch Trial book. The title is very misleading. I do not recommend."
positive,"She is AWESOME!!!: She is already awesome, but this collection is by far her best. This CD shows her strong vocal ability and she covers the original songs very well. Not taking them to the extremes of where they sound fake or phony like other covers have been covered in the past by other artists. Out of all her music previously, she showed much more maturity for a CD that Sony refused to promote or have anything to do with. Mandy did her style of music, and did it well. Sony should be ashamed of themselves for not promoting such a wonderful CD to its fullest potential. Mandy Moore is very talented, and this CD shows just how talented she truly is. The DVD is an awesome added bonus where she talks about each song, shows off her recording studio, and other cool things. Mandy Moore is amazing and this CD tops her talent."
positive,"A great read: Fascinating family saga (1st of a trilogy) covering the massive cultural, social, and economic changes in rural England in the period from the end of the Boer War through WWI. Very well written, excellent character development - a rich well told tale."
positive,classid: I bought this for my mom. She saw it on tv and wanted a copy for herself. She said boy he can dance.
positive,"Borror and Delong's Study of Insects: Great price...well over half off of the university's bookstore. Only black and white pictures and illustrations, but very thorough coverage of entomology."
positive,"An Enjoyable ""Horror"" Film. More Of An Action-Adventure, With A Dash Of Comedy. An Ideal Popcorn Flick.: This remake of the studio's 1932 film starring Boris Karloff (fresh off his success as the Creature in ""Frankenstein"" the previous year; Kenneth Branagh's 1994 film version, starring Robert DeNiro as the Creature and Branagh as Victor Frankenstein, is more faithful to Mary Shelley's Gothic story, written in 1818) is a fresh and fun-filled ride you'll want to take again and again. Brendan Fraser (""George Of The Jungle"") is an Indiana Jones-type soldier-turned archeologist when a librarian (Rachel W.), due to her brother's (John Hannah) greed, accidentally stumbles upon a map revealing the location of an ancient city. The trail leads them to Egypt, where...I won't say anymore. The sequel is just as entertaining, as well as the prequel (which Sommers didn't direct, but stayed on as producer). All three films should have been rated PG for action-violence."
negative,"people sure dont have much use for their brains: if they have to ''shut it off'' in order to enjoy their choice of entertainment.should we all start wearing bibs and go ''googoo'' as well?!?!this is exactly why hollywood releases such trash as this.they are assured of milions of brain-shutter-off'ers.do these same anti-grey matter force themselves to giggle at the truely corny and cliche?!?!?''i need to validate my buying this ticket....so here goes...ha(1 hour 15 minute gap)ha!''i know damn well hollywood is collectively laughing its a$$ off to the bank!those who gave this a rating above 1 deserving the inevitable sequals.get the wallet out!btw,if the last ditch effort in titling this didnt give the lameness of it away..........so sad!!!!!!!!"
negative,"Not great preparation: I bought this book with the hopes of increasing my verbal scores tremendously on the GRE. Well, it did no such thing. My score only raised 20 points from a practice test taken with no preparation. Don't bother memorizing the 200 Top Used GRE words because only 1 of them was on the test. Waste of valuable preparation time. Buy something else or read lots and lots of scientific journal articles."
negative,"High gloss, thin content: For the Gladiator enthusiast, this DVD set does it proud, supplying almost everything you could desire in a collector's edition. It's a pity that the movie itself does not deliver. The production values are gorgeous, but the storyline is so thin that its straightforward unfolding contains no surprises, and in essence the movie devotes its more than two hours of running time to a story of just three characters."
negative,"Very dissapointing sound quality: The sound quality is so bad on this DVD that I am returning it. I was so surprised that MGM would release this DVD with such poor sound. It totally ruins the movie because you can't easily hear what the actors are saying. Also, the music is such an important part of this movie and is totally destoyed by the lousy sound which I would describe as tinny (equalized towards the upper frequencies). I also, have this movie on an old large laserdisk, and the sound is fantastic on that media."
negative,Predictable and Unrealistic: I decided to read this after seeing all the glowing reviews here. HA-don't believe that hype. I am a Stephen King/Dean Koontz fan and thought this book was AWFUL. None of the characters are fleshed out-you don't feel anything for them. They are cold and unrealistic. The plot is predictable and ridiculous. Skip this one.....
negative,"more like.... Ragged Little Thrill: im guilty. i am one of the many rap fans who rushed out to buy this cd after hearing nelly's ""where the party at"". after listening through the cd twice i have heard more than enough. aside from nelly's track #2, i found very little rap. in fact, the only decent rapping comes from ludacris(#4- cut something). i found the cd so slow and smooth and boring, that it made ""where the party at"" as out of place as a fat kid in dodgeball."
positive,"Very good diplomatic history of a key neutral country in WW2: Book examines Turkey's relations with the major powers during WWII. It includes historical background on the 20s and 30s. Shows how Turkey swayed from Axis to Allies depending on events and avoided Nazi invasion. Some of the more interesting parts of book are not on Turkey but about events in Syria and Iraq and rest of mideast. Extensive Japanese intrigues in Baghdad, for example, sometimes at crosspurposes with German designs. Japan considered Iraq in their sphere"
positive,"metal that will make you smile ! : ): after five awesome years of owning toxicity i still consider this to be one of my favorite cds. i also find that other people who usually cant stand metal/hard rock have enjoyed alot of the songs on this cd, especially songs like ""bounce"" and ""prison song"" which are very fun and catchy. If you listen to the radio you have probably already heard some of the best songs on this album like: ""Needles"", ""chop suey"", ""toxicity"", and ""aerials"" which are all very good. Toxicity as a whole is very easy to listen thru entirely without really getting bored. and unlike the radio version of aerials the cd version has a 1:30 ending of indian chanting with flute which is kind of wierd... but interesting! so before buying any other s.o.a.d. cds i highly sugest toxicity first. its the most original, most enjoyable, and most unique metal album i have ever heard."
positive,Ocean Wonders Aquarium: This is a great addition to any crib. My 6 week old daughter loves it and just sits and watches the fish swim around before she falls asleep. My only problem with it is that the music doesn't play long enough and she's too young to push the button herself so I find that I'm going back in a few times to have the music play again.
positive,essential: Essential original versions of some of the countlessly versioned riddims that made reggae great. A true masterpiece of Reggae.
positive,A must have for the Serious collector.: This movie adaption of one the most well known cartoons is a must have for the collector of nostalgic era of cartoons. The dvd not only does justice to the movie but it brings forth the life that the movie theaters gave it. It gives it a crisp video and audio feel that will suck you in as you Reminisce of your childhood years. It is great collection for both old and young audience. This dvd is probably one of the most anticipated cartoons to be converted to the digital technology.
positive,"One of my favortie novels ever!: This book had a profound effect on me. It showed me how all thought is subjective, and showed me the fear of a totalitarian society. If you ever have the time of day, please read this book. And remember, two and two makes five..."
positive,"new nightmare fanatic: the movie was very entertaining. i had already seen it when i was i little girl and just had to see it again. i felt like it was my very first time seeing it. everything was on point, the music, the mask, the makeup. this is the best freddy kruger movie that ive seen thus far. my favorite part was when he came out of dylans bed. i think it was mostly the music that made that part the most entertaining to me. i know this movie was made so long ago and there probably wont be a nightmare on elm street 8 but if the creator decides to make another one, ill be first in line to buy my ticket."
negative,"Good intentions gone awry: I looked forward to seeing this movie - but it was a huge letdown. Besides the historical inaccuracies as detailed by earlier reviewers here on Amazon - I felt the actors chosen to play these music icons weren't based on ability, but to try and get a younger audience to pay attention to the film. Mos' Def is NOT an actor in any way, shape or form - his portrayal of Chuck Berry was wooden and inaccurate. On the other hand, Eamonn Walker's take on Howlin' Wolf was STUNNING. I'm sure the makers intentions were good - but the obvious budget restraints and poor choices in actors left me feeling like a great opportunity to shed light on an otherwise under-documented period of music history was squandered."
positive,"HE's So CUTE!!!: His singing is ok, and the songs are not my style, but the four stars are for his looks, oowww!!!"
negative,"good idea but poorly made!: the idea behind this movie was a fabulous one- i mean who wouldn't be scared of a chainsaw welding maniac named leatherface?- but in order for such an idea to work, you have to be able to see the picture on the screen. i mean for me to be scared at a movie, i have to be able to SEE what is happening to the characters! to me, the best part of the movie was the ending... of course that could of had something to do with the fact that the ending was the only part in the movie that you could actually see! though i wasn't impressed with the rest of the movie, i did enjoy the way the potential victim just barely escaped leatherface. it just goes to show that when you could actually see the movie, it was rather enjoyable! i know that it was made on a low budget but come on, couldn't you at least afford a few overhead lights!"
negative,"Very disappointed!: Since this was the number 2 rated DVD player in the 2008 CR Buying Guide, I thought I had nothing to lose. Wrong! The Standard definition picture is pretty bad; I knew that from the review. The 720p setting provides an extremely clear picture; I also knew that from the review. However, the disc tracking is absolutely horrible on this thing. A tiny smudge or scrape on a disc gives this player fits. Even discs that have no apparent defects won't play. I performned an experiment: Discs that wouldn't play on the Pioneer DV-400V WOULD play on my PS2 and a $30.00 Magnavox cheapie I got from WalMart. Needless to say, I'm returing it. The one thing that did work was the USB port. I really enjoyed putting podcasts on my thumb drive and playing them through my stereo."
negative,Not a good measurement: Mark of fitness MF-180 did not work. It did not pick my heart rate accurately no matter how many times I repositioned it. It was also uncomfortable. I do not recommend this for anyone who needs a reliable heart rate reading.
positive,Thumbs up: Great product. Now I'll be able to study for my final exam andNot worry about depending on others to help me study.
positive,"Basie CD: As a huge Count Basie fan for many years, any Basie CD is a desirable item for me. The Sinatra angle just makes it even better!"
positive,"It really helped me: I had very bad hoarseness from acid reflux. Prescription medicine wasn't helping. My doctor advised elevating the head of the bed with blocks but that was not practical. I showed my doctor a picture of the prop up pillow and he said it looked to be the correct dimension. Within a couple of days after receiving my pillow my hoarseness was gone! Yes, the pillow appears expensive but it is much less expensive than buying an adjustable bed. I don't use the neck roll - I prefer to use my own memory foam pillow. My doctor said the back roll is to help keep one from sliding down the pillow. I strongly recommend this pillow to anyone with GERD/acid reflux."
positive,"Ocean Wonders Fishbowl: My son has one of these, being a keen fisherman I found this toy particulaly great :). It has fish in water inside the bowl with sparkly bits and lights up and plays carribean style music which is hilarious. It also does this everytime the baby drops one of the coloured balls in. It is visually pleasing for the baby and us - good work Fisher Price"
negative,"To put it nicely....: This book really stunk. It almost seems like he forgot to send the manuscript to the editor. Surely the editor wouldn't have let him ramble on and on about snow, and trees, and oh-my-god the smell and sound of the bodily functions of these ""people"". I vowed that I would never again rush to the store to buy one of his books because they have been so diappointing, but I did this time because it was tauted as ""a return to horror"". I now once again vow to NEVER rush out to buy his books. The used bookstore will have plenty of his stinkers for 50 cents in the future."
positive,"Best of the series: A first rate beautifull compilation, with every selection a winner. One of my personal favorties. Great music and great soundinf too. Ella's ""Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most"" was for me, a revelation. All artists best work."
negative,"Dreamcatcher not a dream: Stephen King, the brilliant author of so many wonderful stories has so disappointed me with this book. Curiousity of how he will end the story kept me going, but the horrible toilet references and boring military ego chapters made me cheer when I gratefully reached the end!"
negative,"This radio looks good... but that's as far as it goes.: The radio looks good and has nice features, but there is a problem that cannot be overcome.You have to press the PTT button for at least 2 seconds before talking. Why? The PTT button is a dual-function button. Obviously it is a PTT, but it is also a Monitor button. This makes it necessary to hold it down for at least 2 seconds before talking. Getting people to realize this and have them remember to do this is next to impossible.This made the radio very frustrating to use. I eventually sent them back for a refund."
positive,"Don't label, box and bury God: This book will show you how we all want to define God as we want to, not as God wants. You will see yourself in the pages of this book and hopefully, you will make an honest effort to rise above your restrictive defintion of God. If so, it will have expanded your understanding of your world. This is a good book for a class in spirituality to discuss."
negative,"Is There A Cliche That Wasn't Used?: This absolutely idiotic excuse for a movie actually got enjoyable after a while, simply because my viewing companions and I began a game of ""Guess Which Cliche Is Going To Be Used Next"". By the time The Black Baron (whatever... ) got himself shot, a la ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the group was overcome by hysterical - albeit quite rude - comments and laughter.Haven't had that much fun since that stupid movie about the F16 pilot shot down over Bosnia.To think that such bravery, such envelope-pushing, such absolute horror has devolved into a depiction such as this.Jeez-Oh-Man, what'r they gonna do to the Battle of Britain?!?!?!?"
positive,"Great CD-- Definitely worth the 4 year wait: I Bought this CD the day it came out. I was actually surprised. I had no idea I would receive the second disc which contains a live version of the song ""Invisible City""(from ""Bringing Down the Horse"") and ""Sleepwalker"" again. But the whole CD is great. It was definitely worth the 4 year wait for the CD to come out. Every song on it is great. Though I love them all, 3 of my favorites are ""Sleepwalker,"" ""Some Flowers Bloom Dead,"" and ""Murder 101."" Here's another thing. Even if you don't buy the Limited Edition copy, on the regular disc, after track ten(""Birdcage"") ends, keep listening. After it ends, there is a hidden song called ""Babybird."" It is another great song."
positive,"BEST SHOES EVER: I WORK IN A MEAT DEPARTMENT,AND MY FEET WERE ALWAYS COLD AND WET.I ORDERED THESE BOOTS AND I PLAN ON GETTING A FEW MORE PAIRS.THEY KEEP MY FEET WARM WHILE BEING VERY COMFORTABLE AND DRY..TOOK A WHILE TO GET THEM BUT THEY ARE WORTH IT"
positive,"great!!: the film is great, more realistic than previous films, and the bonus dvd it's full of interesting material!!"
positive,"essential reading in architecture: this is a 'must' reading for anybody interested in architectural theory and philosophy ... but it goes way beyond, connecting ethics and aesthetics within a contemporary discourse that transcend post-modern, post-structuralist and phenomenologist biases. This is my third copy and i required it as a reading to all my students in architecture theory."
negative,"Both forward and backward in its ideas: First of all: those who found the book to be dull, such as me, listen to it on tape (it's abbreviated yet still dangerous = boring to listen to while driving, as I found out). Indeed, Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times, such as writing about a single mother, as well as musings about women's rights. His obsession with Victorian themes, such as the deification of children, fixation on bodily sins, as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader. While this book could probably be considered ""a classic,"" such as Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina,"" both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories."
negative,"Vague: This is not a good Java book. It goes too fast over topics that should be covered in more depth, lacks examples, mentions concepts never explained before, and the teaching style is horrible. If you want a thorough introduction to Java, with plenty of examples, and a well-organized method of teaching, do not buy this book, instead get ""Beginning Java 2"" by Ivor Horton. ""Just Java"" seems like was written to simply let you know that the language exists and it has this and this feature, but it doesn't teach how to use them. I don't even see it as being a good reference book. The 5-star reviewers must have been paid to give such good comments on this book."
negative,"It makes me wonder...: I bought this book for my nephew, and read it to him one night while babysitting.We were through nine pages when he told me to stop.In his words, this story is ""dumber than Teletubbies.""I did some research on the author and I found some wonderful photographs he made.Writing doesn't seem to be his best talent. I wouldn't buy this book to use as a coaster. I would use some of his photos, though."
positive,"You should have seen this already...: This is just Five Faces Of Darkness, the five part third season premier from the original Transformers TV show. If you grew up back then, like me, then you should have already seen this yourself back in the day. If you didn't, or you're new to G1 shows, this is ok but not essential to your enjoying The Transformers: The Movie. The F.H.E. Video of these episodes has been available for rent at my local ... for years & years. Since it's not likely to be available here, check your ... or, better yet, go to ..., check out the CTLP and get your episodes on VHS from one of the many video traders/sellers who have many if not all G1 episodes on tape. That's what I did for the episodes I wanted that haven't been released by Rhino Video yet."
negative,"DO NOT BUY ON BLU-RAY!! (horrible picture): Paramount destroyed the picture in this blu-ray release. In order to get the picture to look smoother, they applied effects that not only got rid of grain, but immense amounts of detail. Matter of fact, the effects they applied to the picture even got rid of things like distant arrows being shot through the sky. Simply put, the broadcast version looks better, and even the DVD has more detail in certain scenes.This is a crime to such a wonderful movie. Wait for them to fix this. Please do not support them."
negative,"Not worth buying: Get something else. This is a USB 1.1, not USB 2.0. So, it does not work well with, say, a USB 2.0 flash drive. And, it may not work at all with a USB 2.0 flash drive. Normally, I could plug my USB 2.0 flash drive into a USB 1.1 port and use it, even though I get an initial alert saying a detected device will perform better on a USB 2.0 port. However, a PNY USB 2.0 flash drive I own would not work at all with this USB hub. I can plug the flash drive directly into the same USB port on the computer and use it but it will not work with this hub.The cable on this hub is only about 18 inches long, so you'll probably need to use an extension cable if you want to connect it to the back of a tower PC sitting on the floor."
negative,"Great for Twins: I purchased the Alphabet blocks for my twin daughters. They are just over 8 months old and they love them. This product is a great learning tool for them for years to come but for now it a great teething toy!!! I would recommend this to anyone, plus I love Fisher Price."
negative,"I expected so much more...: after really enjoying the first three books in this series, I expected more than this terribly insipid work. It seemed rushed, poorly thought out and I was extremely disappointed."
positive,What fine lines????: I love this product and found that it really worked well to heal my face after a chemical peel. I was through the entire process in five days and my skin looks great.
positive,Out of the Loud Hound of Darkness: What is the difference between anodyne and androgyne? Follow this gambit through a gamut of word pairs to attain/obtain a clinquant mastery of English vocabulary and word usage.
positive,"Works as advertised: Good product, works just as described. Easy to install. Have not had any problems thus far."
positive,"Typical Manipulations with Tragic Consequences: Many readers will fail to realise that such a tragic life was the common lot of young, attractive poverty stricken women ages ago just as it is today. Children and teens continue to be sold and/or directed to a life of drudgey, service or near slavery, if not in fact slavery, by parents knowing no way out of their own dire conditions. That poverty worldwide continues to dictate a similar fate for young ones today while we, in comfortable surroundings, debate the merits of a novel, here in America, is a sad legcy indeed for a tale of warning, and unfortunately, of prediction. It is all well and good to fasten ones attention on a good resd-but pray do not miss the point! Hypocrisy lives on when the book is finished."
positive,"Blissfully arranged, elegant easy listening music.....: Something of a Cult band insofar as their albums (although critically applauded) are usually stumbled across by word of mouth. The unashamedly `Easy Listening' tag associated with their music, probably deters people. But if you actually listen to the tracks, there's a preciousness to they very accessibly music, that although features lyrics of hushed sighs & several instrumental tracks feature throughout. You'd have to be a cynical listener not to smile when hearing the catchy guitar pop of ""Afternoon Speaker"", or indeed the acoustic lounge of ""The Leaf"".....not an album to impress your friends with. But for music that evokes positive expression & sunny afternoon on every turn, restrained, Bittersweet indie Pop has rarely been so well composed."
negative,Not good...: Reasons not to read this book:-it's out of date-75% of the book is nothing more than a summary/overview ofexisting reits. Basically book stuffin'-one can obtain the above info from nareit.com and companyprofiles from yahoo or other sites-15% of it is the history of reits... nice to know but doesn'thelp me pick the best reits-10% is some basic accounting terminology and a vague senseof what to look for in picking out a reit to invest in. Ialready had this information from my web readings.For someone with absouletly no knowledge of reitsor even investing I guess this would be a ok starting point.just my two cents...
positive,"Awesome!!: Buy this now, awesome movie! Brings you back to the 80's, the animation is top notch! Wish there was an official blu ray release."
negative,"Not Like the Old Formula: The formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by L'Oreal. The new formula doesn't hold hair like the old Artec original formula did, and it doesn't smell as nice. Don't be fooled by this picture (12/29/07)--it is a pic of the old Artec bottle, but I ordered and received the new L'Oreal Professionel version, which is terrible. The original Artec version was similar to, but not as sticky as, Potion 9. I wish L'Oreal would go back to the old formula :( I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied. If anyone can recommend a similar product, please comment to this review."
negative,"This books should be banned for 100 years in SOLITARY: This book won the NOBEL Prize? I just can't help it, I need to write another review.This book should be placed in Solitary Confinement for 100 years. This is to save both time and trees used in printing of this book.Do not even dare buy this book even from a 2nd hand bookstore. Believe me, do not waste your money."
negative,"Greatly Disappointing: I'm shocked at how badly this album actually turned out. Perhaps it was too big of a rush job but the lyrics and production on this album do not compare to the JE Heartbreak album. Most of the songs are weak and nothing really sticks out and grabs you the way many of the great tracks from JE Heratbreak did. When you're best track features Nelly, you know you are probably in trouble. I'm as big a fan as any but i can't sing their praises this time. Clearly Jagged Edge is clearly lacking the hunger from their last album."
negative,"Boring, boring, boring: The only thing this movie inspired in me was sleep. It was like watching a movie while being high on novacaine, a truly mind numbing experience. The whole experience was a terrific letdown after seeing the previews on television. I went to the theater thinking I was going to see an epic, and came home deadened and thanking God that there are other good movies to see. If all movies were this horrible, I'd never set foot in a theater again."
negative,"Ayn Rand's favorite book, and a real crapfest!: God knows I love Ayn Rand for the honesty and precision of her intellect, but she sure was a weirdo! This dull, uninspiring tripe about a man trying to get a grain silo built was her favorite book of all time! The only reason this book still exists in print is that her slavish devotees mimic her opinions and tastes to the letter."
positive,Great Bra's: Been buy them at store in my home town but have been to happy with the owner. Glad i could find them here. Thanks
positive,"the book was fine why complain?: The main thing that I have a problem with is that the older reviewers of this book don't stop to consider that for kids this book was a fantastic story. Also, I know some are just trying to give Paolini constructive criticisim, but slashing the book and calling it 'all ready done' is immature if you ask me. Paolini was 15 when he wrote this. Give him a break he's a biginner and he'll learn. So for all you adult 'know-it-alls' cut him some slack and keep your rude thoughts to yourself. Your reviews will make people not want to by his books in the future. Now how would that make you feel if you knew you were responsible for Paolini's downfall?"
positive,"Good, as far as intro compilations go: Yes, a terribly obvious collection of songs, and I pretty much program out Fatboy Slim (and the awful title track) when I play this CD. But the pacing and selection of the remaining songs are better than most comps, with Lo-Fidelity, Prodigy, Orb, Chem Bros, Crystal Method and Propellerheads all flowing together nicely. I prefer this to the other compilations with which this overlaps heavily, like MTV's Amp2. Nothing earthshattering, but decent and very danceable."
negative,Kids and family? Far from it.: This was under the children and family category. It was fine until a couple minutes in when a woman gets savagely killed by a lion. Far from appropriate for my child.
positive,"Parallels: 1984 is a haunting political satire about Big Brother's relentless assault on privacy, individuality and freedom.One can only hope 1984 is more brilliant story than cautionary tale because parallels seem so easily drawn with our warrantless searches, ubiquitous cameras, invasive software, workplace surveillance and legislation that erodes the rights of citizens in the name of fighting terrorism.Yet it is the relationship that develops between Winston, a cautious but hopeful thinking man, and Julia, a young seemingly committed Party member, that adds incredible humanity to otherwise empty, cheerless lives in Oceania. Theirs is a relationship that surprisingly springs amid bleakness and desolation, flowers against all odds, and ultimately wilts under betrayal.Readers will discover that Orwell's objectives are both thoroughly and terrifyingly achieved with a perfectly dystopian ending."
positive,"For the Ultimate fan!!! But where's Patrick Swayze???: This is a great edition of the classic Dirty Dancing. It has a TON of special features including music videos of the 3 most popular songs and a full length Dirty Dancing concert. And of course the regular interviews and retrospectives. I am a little disapointed however. Patrick Swayze is not interviewed AT ALL and the only actor they talk to is Jennifer Grey. I would have liked to see interview with other characters and the writer talk more about how she wrote the movie. The other disk is of course the great movie! No complaints about that. Even with some missing features, still the best edition around."
positive,"Awesome Movie Experience, Mp3 needs minor improvements...: First of all, I'd like to start by saying that this DVD player does a awesome job on playing DVD Movies! Picture and sound are excellent....For the 4-stars :I took away 2 stars because my primary use of this machine was MP3 playback.....There are lots of improvement to be made in the MP3 portion of this machine::Positive : 1.Attractive on-screen mp3 layout2. Program, Repeat and Random features...Negative : 1. On-screen display only shows the first 8 characters of the song filename. (Which sux!)2. No fast forward or rewind during MP3 playback...Which is insanely disturbing to me...3. The player has problems playing CD-RW discs. I regularly hear pops, clicks and zips during playback. Im not sure if this is only on CD-RW discs...That's it!!If you'r an audiophile like me and into MP3....You might turn your head towards the JVC XV-S60BK.But if your into mostly watching movies....GO FOR IT!!!"
negative,"don't believe the hype: i loved the first spiderman and really looked forward to seeing this one. unfortunately it's horrible. it may be the worst edited movie i have ever seen. the whole thing doesn't make sense, jumps around, doc ock is hardly in the movie, etc. don't believe the hype. if you judge this movie on its own merits, you will see just how bad it really is."
positive,"Incredible! The best ever!: I rented this DVD online and was on the edge of my seat,glued to the screen and never blinked until the end! I hit title repeat right away and went amazon to buy one and gift-click four more to web friends.I will remember this film forever!If Run Lola Run was up for a little golden man it would expose the others as impotent,unoriginal bits of trash."
negative,"Nuttin' new here: Although you could never say that this album is a complete wash, it never even got close to tickling my mind, catching me off guard with a fresh, unexpected turn of melody or riddim or sound splash. It ended up sounding way too cliche...and pardon the paraphrase...but...""Everything she dropped was so tired."""
positive,This was easy: The shipping was faster than I expected. GEAT shipper. At first I thought that this would be complicated and won't live up to expectation from the reviews that I read. Well it was easy once I read the instructions. There was no mess and I din't get a drop of ink on the sink or on my hand. I highly recommend this ink refill kit. Just follow the instructions. I'll be returning to purchase more.ChuckW213
negative,"Installation is awful: The tape was the problem. The tape that comes with this product did not stick to the window, despite cleaning the surface. It did stick to the plastic, causing the plastic to bunch up. After a long...frustrating attempt at sealing, I managed one window and gave up on the rest. I would strongly caution against this product."
negative,"That's it?: My buddy Beau and I went to see this movie a week after it opened. We had heard a lot of hype about the ""film"" and we were very excited about the potential orgiastic cinema experience that lay ahead! Needless to say this is the cinematic equivalent of blue-balls. Never before have I left a theater with a feeling of such utter disapointment. I am still waiting to see the version that was screened for members of the academy, because the version I saw was about as Oscar-worthy as ""White Chicks"". If you are looking for a truly great ""gladiator"" movie, buy the special edition of Conan the Barbarian. The commentary alone is worth the price, trust me."
positive,"Agressive, Wild, Experimental & Honnest poetry: In this experimental album, Bélanger shows his own dark & hidden garden. Obviously describing his fights against a depressive lifestyle and his deepest reflexions in his previous album (Rver Mieux - wich totally impressed me), he comes back with an exclusive musical and lyrical style mostly expressing how he concieves life as a constant fight (analogy: boxe). All songs bearing numbers instead of titles, he lets listners use their intelligence & imagination in order to ""feel"" the music his own way.One of the most impressive album from Quebec this year.I give 5 stars and two thumbs up."
negative,BAD COPY of a Great Movie: This is a terrible copy of a good movie. The film is dark in scenes making some of it unwatchable. Some scenes are cut together in imovie or something. Also (as mentioned in another review) some sound effects are missing. The Rankin Bass cartoon is great but this is a pirated disc or copy of a torrented file. THIS IS A BAD BUY.
positive,"Easy to read, packed with wisdom: I have thoroughly enjoyed reading Parables. I didn't expect this book to be overflowing with facts on jewish culture. Gary does an excellent job describing the context for each parable. Gary picked essential parables and truly helps you understand what Jesus meant. One nice surprise is Gary's theological application. If you like books that flow but have a deeper teaching then you should buy this book. Let this book be a deeper devotional or a study tool for your next teaching on a parable. I promise you will be inspired and encouraged by Gary's interpretation of the Parables."
positive,A GOOD START TO A VERY SUCCESSFUL SERIES: Good British drama series. Good Start for Season 1 and I was impressed with Helen Mirren's character both personal and work related.
negative,"Story and Action is Lacking: This movie starts out well enough. The first fight scene is quick but entertaining. The plot thickens as his family is slain and he is in a coma, unbeknownst of the Bad guys (they think he died also). But while Seagal delivers a strong performance in a poorly directed movie, everything else crumbles. Le Brock, then married to Seagal, is poor as the nurse bringing Seagal back to health so he can clear his name and wallop the bad guys. Bill Sadler is OK as the sinister, power hungry senator, but the movies fight scenes are boring and people are knocked out in unrealistic fashion (a lot of Glass Jaw Joes in this film).Still, it is not a total disaster, if you have an hour and a half to kill; it beats any Seagal Movie besides Exit Wounds since 1997."
negative,"Just an outline of substance: This is a good book if you just want to know what's out there in terms of the different categories of technology. The author spends almost no time on any one technology, so this is purely just an overview book."
negative,"Danger.....: Watch out for this turkey! Definitely a disk for the true believers only. Sound quality as bad as any bootleg I have ever listened to, some songs fade (on a live album!?) and skimpy liner notes add up to a pretty bad package. And the addition of a keyboard player seems to hurt rather than add to WA's sound. If you are dying for a live disk from WA's ""Locked In"" tour, this will have to do. Otherwise, save your money."
negative,"Big Let-down: After waiting all these years to finally finish the story of Ayla and Jondalar, I am severely disappointed in the fifth book in the Earth's Children series. I loved the first four books but found myself actually skipping pages in this one. I was skipping pages not because I was so excited, but because I was trying to find something to keep me interested. That dreadful song/psalm/poem nearly killed me. I do hope that Ms. Auel will not feel she has to retell the major points of her previous five books when she writes the sixth installment of the series. This book was too long. ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" is only 468 pages long and it is a great story. Instead of writing another epic 700+ page novel, maybe the next book will be a little less long-winded and a little quicker in coming, too. I gave the book two stars but you can see I am already anxious for the next part of the story to be told. Please, Ms. Auel, just keep it simple next time. Thank you."
positive,"SOMEBODY HAD TO TELL IT: After viewing this documentary, I've still got chills running up and down my back. This is how Christianity was forced on the world? Somebody should tell somebody. And now it has been modified to fit today's atmosphere. Can you say 'Waterboarding'?"
negative,Too Much Singing !: Knowing it was a musical I was prepared for a fair portion of singing but had not expected a movie hardly with any spoken lines! There must have been about 1 full hour of song and to make matters worse most of the material ranged from forgettable to outright unmelodious or awkward. The cast certainly proved they could sing but with hardly a spoken line and without a decent storyline it made for very long and dull viewing.
negative,"More Like ""Royal Rape"": The so-called ""hero"" of this book is nothing more than a rapist. For goodness sake, the first time they get together, he throws her down, holds her down and rapes her, and yet this is somehow supposed to be seen as romantic.This book is sickening. It does not deserve to be called a romance novel."
negative,Cheaply produced edition: The poor attention to typography has rendered this edition almost unreadable. I was looking to save a few dollars and read a great classic and instead I have a five-pound doorstop.
positive,"Reading The Hobbit after The Fellowship of the Ring: I read The Fellowship of The Ring about a month and a half ago, when I finished I decided to go back and read The Hobbit. After reading The Hobbit I understood the Fellowship better. I highly recomend reading The Hobbit fisrt if you are interested in the series, however reading the books individually is almost as interesting. I like how the series is set up, so that each book is an adventure of it's own and reading the other books only helps one better understand the books as a whole."
negative,"Generic: After hearing every mile a memory and kinda liking it and reading the reviews here at CDNOW I am very disappointed that I bought this cd. Dierks is just another generic country boy. I was hoping for something different from him, but alas, not. After one listen, not one song sticks to me except his hit, and that isn't very good. Don't believe I'll be buying anymore of this stuff."
positive,"A Charlie Brown Christmas: Always loved watching A Charlie Brown Christmas on TV during the holiday season, now I can watch it any time.The extra features included were great, one I had never seen before. Thoroughly enjoyable speaking as a Charlie Brown fan."
positive,Quiet Nights: Momento is a continuation of Gilbertos bossa nova lineage and the near perfect production shouldn't be minimized. Gilberto creates moods backed by rhythm and song and she hasn't done it better than on this disc -- really a perfect marriage of Tanto Tempo and it's gorgeous follow up Bebel Gilberto. I had the pleasure of seeing her perform with a symphony orchestra a few months ago and the songs here were alive and shimmered with orchestral backing -- Bebel herself is sublime. A true talent that will be around for years to come.The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves
positive,"Excellent value!: Due to a past positive experience with Topeak Customer Service (on a broken bike pump - my fault), I was sold on this company. So when I needed a new computer and saw one by Topeak I checked it out. The features were all that I wanted and it looked simple to use and easily readible. Also, the price could not be beat ($10). It was an excellent choice. It was also easier than other bike computers to install and get set up to use. I am very happy with this purchase and will continue to check out Topeak products."
negative,"Mother of a Fourth Grader: My daughter was assigned to read this book over the summer in between 4th and 5th grade. Although I know it is a great classic, it is extremely difficult to read, especially for her age. I am reading it to her and I, myself find that it is difficult to read and there are many words which I need to look up and many phrases which I cannot even lookup, so we are missing a great deal. I wish there was a modern American English translation available so that we could enjoy the story and not get so stuck on just trying to understand what is going on."
positive,"still sounds good: it's now official. . .KISS HAS BECOME THE BEST EVER KISS TRIBUTE BAND on the planet.the music still holds up and it is good in whatever package you want to put it in . . but if you want to hear something new you wont get it from KISS... until you stop buying these things, you will never get anything new from this band . . . ."
positive,"Yeesh, how does she put up with those brats?!: As a novel that follows the plight of a young woman forced into the position of a governess to make ends meet, Anne Bronte's Agnes Grey has of course often been compared with her sister's more famous novel Jane Eyre. And as a love story, it has also been compared with the novels of Jane Austen. It even reminded me a little of the cautionary morality tales that had been popular up to that time, such as Defoe's Moll Flanders.Personally, I enjoyed it more than Pride and Prejudice, but not as much as Jane Eyre. It just doesn't have the same scope and depth. Anne's second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, on the other hand, does, so I would recommend that over this. That said, this is a nice little novel, and interesting, and sometimes very funny. Well worth reading.And this audio edition narrated by Emilia Fox, who does an excellent job, is very enjoyable to listen to."
positive,YOU HAVE ANOTHER WINNER..... CONGRATULATIONS: CHRISTINE HAS DONE IT AGAIN... THIS BOOK IS AS GOOD AS HER DARK SERIES... WITH JUST ANOUGH SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT - TO SPARK THE INTEREST... OF THOSE PARANORMAL ROMANCE LOVERS. IN HER USUAL STYLE THE CHARACTERS ARE IMMOTIONALY BOUND AND KEEP YOU READING ON AND ON IN ONE SITTING - WITH A CLIMATIC ENDING THIS BOOKS KEEPS YOU QUESSING RIGHT TILL THE END...TRUE GOTHIC WITH CREEPY HOME - WEIRD RELATIVES AND ODD SERVANTS.. I LOVED IT... AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.... CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT GOTHIC - OR ANY OF HER DARK SERIES FOR THAT MATTER.. WELL DONE..
negative,"Not great: While I love Billie, in her own words, these sessions were dull, and uninspired. Since the reviews should focus on one CD, that is the jist of it; boring renditions, and back up musicians that are not the ones that Billie was used to making for a very uneven collection."
positive,"BUY IT: This CD is awesome. Its great punk rock. Every song is great and worth listening to.If your a fan of punk or just like music, go out and buy this cd now!!"
negative,"????????: i liken this book to fitzgerald's ""tender is the night."" and that is not a good thing. people of no substance plod through hundreds of dull dull pages. are people really this shallow? this empty? probably. but, my god, do i have to read about them? no. i do not. i simply could not finish this book (and that is rare). i wasted valuble reading time for about 300 pages, then had to admit it just wasn't working. because of all the critical acclaim this book recieved, i was very much looking forward to reading it. what a major disappointment! i am truly puzzled by the positive response this thing gets from so many people. great writing? really? i just did not see much of that here. shouldn't a book have at least one interesting character in it? it seems that dullness is making a comback in critical circles these days. too bad."
negative,"smaller than expected: I was tempted to buy this product because of the reduced price, but was disappointed that the case barely holds the DVD recorder and little else. It is fine for carrying the recorder when out and about, but as far as carrying extra discs or charger, forget it."
negative,isn't it ironic: that the song lyrics espouse a return to more real values but the misleading hype about an internet webcast is anything but revolutionary or based on being realonly in this cynical marketing age... pity!
negative,"Didn't hold up.....very disappointed: I bought this OXO Insight Tea Kettle tea after I'd let my former whistler boil dry. The whistling cover on the spout had been left in the ""UP"" position after filling and I totally forgot about it. Well, I thought, THIS teakettle had solved that problem for me. Just a squeeze of the handle causes the spout top to flip down into the spout. When the the kettle is set down and the handle released, the spout top closes. What a great idea!After just 6 months of light use, the spout top will no longer close. I am so disappointed. FYI, the whistle on it was great, not too irritating, but loud enough to get one's attention.I am on the hunt for a new teakettle. A stainless one with a non-irritating whistle --- some of these teakettles sound like a tornado siren."
negative,"disappointed: I think this is a case of my expectations being too high. I was so encouraged by the great reviews of this product, I really was expecting a miracle. After only wearing this twice, it is stretched out. At first, I thought perhaps it would regain it's shape after a few hours but nope! It's no better than a cheap, fashion corset. It will smooth things out so there's less bulging under the clothes but I was looking for a real ""waist trainer"", something that would go on tight and STAY tight. Considering I found this product when I searched specifically for ""waist trainer"", I would say the claims of this product are misleading. It is shapewear, it is NOT a ""cincher"" or a ""trainer""."
negative,"Hip Hop Uncensored, Vol. 7: Hustle On: i purchased this thinking it was a music video dvd which it is not its more of a documentry with no videos"
positive,"Underrated movie: If you haven't caught this one, it's definitely worth seeing. Intrigue and romance set against the terror of WWII. One of Melanie Griffith's better performances, and Michael Douglas and Liam Neeson, well, they're always good."
positive,"Excellent History of the Development of Wicca and Modern Paganism: I loved this book- as a neopagan it gave me insight into how much of Wicca, and in turn, neopaganism developed. I realize it does only focus on Wicca itself and that there were several other movements contributing to the rise of Neopaganism, but the book's title states the topic so no reader should be expecting much else! On the flip side, because they helped contribute, Freemasons, Aleister Crowley, and others are covered even though they themselves were not Wiccan. Overall, excellent book, well-written, and a must-read for any and all people even interested in Neopaganism, Wicca, or modern witchcraft!"
positive,"A joy to read: Sandburg took criticism for filling in some blanks with his imagination, but so what? His biography of Lincoln was not intended as a scholarly treatise. Think of the mystic atmosphere of a campfire at night, with an elder telling about the greatest person in a tribe's history. That is Sandburg's accomplishment, making Lincoln live again among us, at least while we are surrounded by Sandburg's mesmerizing account. No one interested in Lincoln or in the meaning of America should miss the experience of these volumes."
negative,cover judged better than actual film: Probably the worst film K. Douglas was in..........Really shocked..quite dated and slow ....I dont recommend to anyone with a brain.
positive,"Long torso but great product: Received this product in the mail and have worn it a few times. It's fairly comfortable for a bustier/corset style waist cincher. The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette (most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly). I'm pleased with the product. One thing I will say on the negative side is that I'm rather short. These are more of a one-size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I'm 5'1"". Not an issue, it's meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants, but I'm already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans. Not the best for sitting, whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely wouldn't do that. The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised."
negative,"AWFUL!: I have to say, this was the WORST Nic Cage movie I have ever seen! The director is horrible, it looks like a cheap movie and why waste your time? And Val Kilmer, dude, lose some weight, you make me want to start working out more just seeing you! He looked his best in Top Gun, but ever since that movie, and Batman, he has let himself go! I am not trying to judge, but he used to be nice to look at...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I am glad it was free thru the Prime, thank goodness!"
positive,"Good reading from a business savvy CPA: Harvey knows his stuff, which is obviously based on years and years of experience and seeing it all. The would-be and budding entrepreneur would be well advised to heed his advice. This book stresses the importance of working ON your business, not just IN your business."
negative,"A terribly inaccruate version of the story, not worth it...: This movie is not worth the cash it takes to get it, a terribleshowing of the original story -- it almost makes fun of it. It doesall people in it injustice. If your looking for something that gets the bang for for buck, this isn't it."
negative,"Shipping is outrageous!: Shipping is outrageous!sure your prices look the best but the shipping is highway robbery!How dare you charge more for shipping then the item it's self, and more than you indicated!the seller is a liar!"
positive,Live Honey: This band rocks!!!!!!!! Great lyrics and rythms that keep you on the edge of your seat. The lead singer can sing her tail off!Turn up the volume and enjoy this wonderful CD.
positive,"Average singer - Great songs: Neil Young has a nasal, sometimes annoying voice. His saving grace is that he writes great songs. This album has several, centred firmly on the Canadian prairie. The style is country rock - tending to the softer end of the spectrum but the lyrics are perceptive, sometimes whimsical and longing, often biting. For example, he describes the joyous scene of a wedding in a church he's previously described as ""the fallen soldier bell"". There are elements of nostalgia and undercurrents of bitterness (""Somewhere a senator sits in a leather chair ... He takes his money just like all the rest.""). There's sweetness and love for both people present and those past. There are many lovely pictures in words.The more I've played this, the more I like it. I have a few albums that I simply can't put away. This is one."
negative,"SO DISAPOINTED: i did not pay head to the other reveiws, and bought this bike anyway. the first day i had it, the back fender snapped off, leaving sharp points exposed. sadly, we had to tell our 4 year old, on his birthday, that he could not ride the bike. so we returned it and got another one. not more than 30 mins after getting on the new one, than the ""exhaust pipes"" came off, leaving a VERY sharp screw exposed, then the tire came off and the rim broke, becuase it was plastic as well. also, the vinyl on the seat started to come apart.at this point, i had to return it, and fight to get my money back!! it was a week after it had been delivered to the house. i was to afraid that my kids would get hurt on this peice of junk.please do not endanger your children by purchasing this bike!!"
negative,"Warning: Rats: So one of my best friends has some rats. Also a snake. I had this with me at the time I visited her. I was deciding on which animal to feed it to. I thought about the snake. Then thought about that scene from ""Aladdin"", and i wasn't about to get killed by no mutant snake. I mixed some of this in with the rat food, and a little bit more with their water for good measure. Boy was I wrong. I'd love to stay and write more, but the giant rat attacks, you understand..."
negative,"Not so yummy looking: This book was a bit of a disappointment. None of the pictures of cookies in the book actually look good to eat. They look like they would be ideal in decorating the witch's house from Hansel and Gretel but I wanted cookies to eat not enjoy visually. I like the retro look but for cookies that are meant to be eaten, I recommend the Cookie Bible. Everything in that book looks and tastes great."
negative,"Biohunter: Biohunter is pretty much stock anime. Its not boring, but it is predictable. The animation is okay in a 1980's kind of way. If you like cutting edge anime dont watch this, but if youre looking for a bit of rental fun and don't expect too much this would be just fine. Thanks for your time."
positive,A classic book.: We had to compare this book and the movie Clueless for a college class of mine and I needed a copy for it.
negative,"Big Town, Little Movie: Matt Dillon stars in this Ben Bolt movie about a young gambler from the 50`s that goes to Chicago in order to improve his life. Diane Lane and Tommy Lee Jones also give standout performances here, and most of the cast is convincing enough. The problem seems to be Bolt`s direction, entirely average and bland, which doesn`t provide any particural memorable moment or scene. There are no impressive camera-angles here, so what counts is really the plot. The worse thing is that the plot is just adequate yet nothing special either, presenting a typical rags-to-riches storyline with cliched characters and unsurprising situations. The acting makes it work in a mildly interesting manner, though, so the movie still manages to be an entertaining pick for a rainy day. ""The Big Town"" is another average film worth watching once and be done with it.Not a keeper."
positive,"Swingin' and Jumpin' the whole time!: I recently discovered the new Swing music, and the reason I love CPD so much is because they don't try to fake the old sound. They mix it up with their own style of music, which makes it sound completely new, instead of just another wannabe nostalgic song. I can't stop poppin' this cd into the player. It's amazing. This is one cd that you'll never want to skip a song on. And let me tell you, CPD are even better in concert. I mean, they are spectacular live! Go see them as soon as possible! You'll be hooked too. -Keep Swingin' -Jen"
negative,"Why?: It is inconceivable that this book would have been printed without the reputable name of James Patterson as author. The plot is simple, the word choice adolescent and the characters are flat and similar; Jennifer is the same as Sam and Brendan is the same as Daniel. I don't take lightly to slamming another writer, yet it is difficult not to when coming across sentences such as these:""I was soooo glad to see Brendan's smiling face.""""...less than three weeks later, something really terrible happened.""""...my eyes were swollen and very, very red.""To use some of Mr. Patterson's own jargon, let me just say: This book is very, very bad. Soooo bad and really terrible."
negative,"Disinformation: I got this book hoping to get more insight on, well, ""cases that haunt us"". This book and several others by Douglas, turned out to be a self-serving puff piece on several complicated cases. This is the literary equivelant of Leslie Neilsen in ""The Naked Gun"" saying ""Move along, there's nothing to see here"" as a fireworks warehouse explodes behind him.Some of these cases deserve serious examination and not a simplistic write-off. Check out Terry Maury's ""The Ultimate Evil"" to see where thorough investigation of these crimes can lead."
negative,just okay: This product is not great. It is a really small quantity for the price. It does go on your face smoothly and feels silky but it does not really add anything to my face care process. I finished the lotion and moved onto a different one and had no change in how my face feels or looks. I think you can get a better product for less money elsewhere.
negative,"Great playing can barely be heard over the hiss & noise: The song selections and Art's playing are truly awesome, but,the sound quality of the first ten tracks is downright pitiful!Track #11, 'Wee Baby Blues' with band & Joe Turner singing, ismore a novelty tune. The 'clean' tracks, #13 thru #19 are allfrom the double-CD release: Art Tatum 20th century piano genius- which is probably a better option. The remaining good track,#12: 'I Got Rhythm' (w/ Tiny Grimes and Slam Stewart) is fromthe CD: I Got Rhythm: Art Tatum Volume 3 (1935-1944)- listen to this disc before buying it!"
negative,Rice cooker: Probably more useful as a soup cooker or steamer. The rice always seems to come out browned and hard on the bottom even if you double the recommended amount of water.
negative,"Refuting nothing: Sarafati's book begins promisingly, but soon degenerates into blatant and unashamed creationist propoganda. He presents a few problems regarding evolution that are worth ruminating over, but for the most part he merely contradicts himself and asserts, without evidence, that his view of the creation of the world fits sceintific evidence better than evolution does. The reader does not have to read far until Sarafati sheds any illusion of scientific fairness or reason. Good for an ardent creationist who would like a source to quote in argument, bad for anyone looking for any real scientific insight."
positive,"I love this movie!: This is such a fantastic animated film. I've loved it since childhood, however, i would love to see a new DVD version of this film. Video is a dead format, and I hope to see this classic brought to life in the dvd world."
negative,Get out your magnifying glass: Get out your magnifying glass and decoder ring cause you're going to need them to read this book.Actually under sufficient magnification and in the right light it looks like an old typewriter font with a really bad ribbon and then shrunken and shoved together.I am over 50 but I have brand new glasses. My wife is younger and does not ware glasses. She took one look and laughed.The paper stock is unremarkable but the largish format looks like it might be just the right size for a bird cage. It might also be good for starting fires but I have not tested this yet.
positive,"The Usual...Just Great!: I'm not really under 13. I just didn't want to sign in. Anyway, this is a great album. Tina's most recent album of original material since 1996's Wildest Dreams, another gem. This is a wonderful album. She seems to be going the Cher route here. ""Whatever You Need,"" ""When the Heartache is Over,"" ""Don't Leave Me This Way,"" and the title track are among my favorites on this album. Also recommend Tina Live in Europe and Simply the Best (2 other Tina albums). Enjoy!! :)"
negative,"The Mummy Should Not Have Returned!: In an attempt to create a series of movies such as the Indiana Jones series, The Mummy Returns fails to hold its audience. Despite the excellent sound quality of this DVD, the story lacks credibility and the acting is non-existent. Because the movie possesses cheap animation and poor video quality, this DVD suffers as a result.If you are looking for a good sequel to a great film, this is not it. The story jumps from one extreme to the other in an unbelievable, cartoonish quality. Because of the success of the first film, producers raced to complete a sequel that should never have been produced. None of the animation in this DVD compares to the higher quality animation in the first DVD.This DVD is better left on the shelf at the video store or in the bargain bin ..."
negative,"So bad it's good: Well, this is probably the worst movie I've seen; bad acting, writing, and special effects. However, being that I do competitively row, I found it incredibly amusing. I don't think anyone who has not done crew will appreciate this movie. It's awful, but if you row, it's awfully funny."
negative,IT SUCKED: This movie was terrible!! The girl was screaming throughout the movie which just made it worse! The only thing scary about this movie is having to watch it!
negative,"Headphone Jack Problems: The headphone jack on my Zen Xtra stopped working day 40 (1st day on a 7-day cruise, no less!) While Creative did replace the unit, why haven't they recalled all Zen's?This is my second Nomad -- I had a Nomad 2.0 20GB, but it's screen stopped working. Creative refused to repair unless I paid $105, so (silly me) I bought a new unit instead.Never again, Creative!"
negative,"want my money back: Parker's dedication was, I concentrated on you Joan. He should concentrate on his writing. The computer enables fast editing and that is all he does. Sunny and Spenser are the same, just cross dressing the characters. Of course the gay guy is Hawk in a nice suit, and all the bad guys are the same. I bought the paperback for a flight home and was wishing for the plane to crash before I choked down another boring, boring page of the same old Parker has been doing for the past twenty years. What is worse are all the glowing reviews from the paid of reviewers."
positive,"Mysterious hospital deaths: Judith McMonigle Flynn needs to have a hip replacement, coincidentally at the same time that her cousin Renie is having shoulder surgery. They are a little apprehensive about their admission to Good Cheer Hospital, because there seems to be a rash of deaths of basically healthy people who have recently had surgery at the hospital. There is a rumor of a takeover of Good Cheer and there are plenty of quirky hospital employees as well as relatives of the deceased which gives Judith a long list of suspects. Her husband is working on a case dealing with homeless people and Judith suspects that there is a connection to the case she's working on. Undaunted by her surgery, Judith travels around the hospital in her wheel chair and, as usual, manages to solve the mystery before the police. This is another enjoyable book in the Bed-and-Breakfast series."
positive,"okay order.: the DVD was not in great condition. started skipping after a few times of watching it. but it arrived in good condition, fast shipping, and overall good transaction."
negative,Republican bashing at its finest: If you like Republican bashing then this book is for you. Whatever happened to the days when people kept their political opinions to themselves. You've lost half of your audience. Your ratings speak for themselves.Being a foodie I was hoping to be inspired. The only morsel I got out of this book was that Julia Child has a recipe for a garlic sauce. I will now confiscate my mother's copy of Mtafc.
positive,DK The Illustrated Bible: Wonderful bible for children. Our church gives first graders their own copy of this bible. They love the illustrations and the way the bible stories are written.
negative,"Where's the thrill: No thrill in this thriller, I was surprised to see other ""good"" reviews. I basically felt it was boring without any ""bang"" at the end."
positive,"LOVE IT..LOVE IT: Mr. Aiken's AMAZING VOICE and the beautifully written SONGS make this a MUST HAVE CD for everyone...There is a little bit of everything on this CD from upbeat love songs to moving ballads...Clay's voice really shines on ""I WILL CARRY YOU"", ""INVISIBLE"" and ""TOUCH"" have great upbeat tempos, ""RUN TO ME"" and ""NO MORE SAD SONG"" prove CLAY can really rock, and you just can't help but sing along to ""WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME"" which is my FAVORITE song on the CD... I recommend you BUY THIS CD TODAY!!"
negative,"Only Windows XP and earlier Support: This scanner works great but if you want to update the unit or use their printing software you can only run their drivers on a Windows XP machine or earlier. Windows XP is over 10 years old. You can't load the data from the scanner into your computer if you have Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8. They seem to have no plan to update their system for this scanner or any of the EZ Scan line.Keep in mind Microsoft is dropping support for Windows XP in spring of 2014, a little more than a year away. Why don't they have something that works with more current computers especially when you can only buy one with Windows 7 or mostly now with Windows 8.In addition, for most of their models the firmware is 4.07 and I believe the 07 stands for 2007 as that's as current as the unit shows for cars. If you have a car 2008 and later it doesn't show. Have to ask why they don't want to update the software for their products and still expect people to buy them."
positive,"What a CD!!!!: I usually listen to Pop and Rock, but when I heard Zoot Suit Riot I knew that Swing was going to be big song. I am starting to look into some other forms of music now just because this CD showed me that there is more to music than just Pop and Rock. So get this CD and you'll see what I mean =)"
negative,"Bad acting film: As with any Zombie film the possibility's are endless. This seems to be just a cash in on the Zombie mania of today. For low budget horror films visit/re-visit the originals. You'll feel better. If i had to choose from low budget zombie films that were original i'd say 'The Veil' is up there for horror, followed by 'Shaun of the Dead' for laughs. I feel with a better cast 'Zombie Town's next film might be better."
negative,"This movie doesn't even deserve 1 star!: I was more than disappointed in this film! I know that most movies based on books don't follow the book exactly. Even the first two in Sullivan's ""Anne"" triliogy didn't follow L.M. Montgomery exactly and I didn't mind too much because the spirit was still true...this doesn't have ANYTHING L.M.M. in it AT ALL!!! K.Sullivan should have just written new character names as well and given it a different name, but to pass this off as the work of L.M.M. is ludicris!"
positive,"great movie: i thought it was a very entertaining movie, should have gotten more press when it came out. very good acting also"
positive,"I love this album!: All I can say is, Clay Aiken has a wonderful voice and every song on this album is a delight to listen to. Usually when I buy an album I will have a few songs that I really like and the others are just okay but that is not so with this album. I love every song! This guy can really sing. His voice is strong and clean. I can't wait for another album to come out by this young man! I purchased one copy and a week later came back and bought two more for gifts and another one for me so I wouldn't have to keep taking the CD from my car to my house.To young and old alike, I have just two words to say--buy it! You will enjoy it!"
positive,Well made and great value!: We had guests that used it last weekend. They said it felt like a real bed. I was so suprised on how quickly it inflated and deflated. The cord hides away in a handy compartment. It keeps its air pressure. No need to carry around a separate pump. Our dog wanted to adopt it as her own bed. The dog jumped on it and tested it toughness. It passed with flying colors.
positive,"Good movie!! (But I'm not sold on the ""BD Live"" thing): This is quite a humorous movie - not to be taken seriously, of course. It made an excellent addition to my movie collection.However, I would say that I don't really understand or much like the ""BD Live"" component (for ""bonus content"" it says on the back of the case): it kept telling me that it was trying to and failing to connect to the internet before it would play the movie and it bothered me. Not a big deal, but a nuisance."
negative,"Numark PT01 Portable DJ Turntable (Purchased on 06/30/2006): I still did not get the item yet.What is going on?Please let me know ASAP.Thanks,Yong"
negative,"NOT a self help book!: Author is utterly self-involved and the book is not helpful by any means. If you want to spend your time in someone else's dreamland, go ahead. But if you're looking to gain some self-understanding, or any insight at all, look elsewhere!I consider this book to be false advertising."
negative,"Measure Of Bad Music: Is the music business this desperate to go and sign this poor excuse for a musician to a record contract?A bad CD. Hey Clay, do us all a favor and retire right now, so our ears don't have to be polluted with this garbage any longer."
negative,"Another boilerplate piece of corporate denialism: More raw meat for the dopes, as the genuflecting huzzahs from the troops above demonstrate.The only good thing about it is it combines in one volume nearly all the salient features of a right-wing corporate handout.It starts off with a lie - that the CMPA is nonpartisan - it's yet another in the stable of Olin/Scaiffe/Bradley funded ""think-tanks"" used to attack science, regulation, and public health.One chapter uses cherry-picking, all of them use weasel words, and most use debauched and invalid statistics.Meanwhile, it tromps heavily on the themes Thomas Frank mentioned in What's the Matter with Kansas - an appeal to you, the common man right-wing crank who's just as good as any pinko academic scientist any day!Oh. It hasn't aged very well, has it?"
negative,AWFUL!: Fazzari massacres these compositions. He can't sing. Plain and simple. The band should be ashamed of themselves. Listen to the samples. They'll make you angry. Total garbage.
positive,"One of the best of Rock'n Roll: Excelent songs among outstanding musicians such as the members of ""The Band"" and Bob Dylan. For the people who likes good music, this CD is indispensable."
negative,"Who did shoot down the Red Baron? The other side of the coin - in fairness.: To be perfectly fair about it, NOVA's documentary disputes the claim made by Keri Bailey ""Kilby"" in the review regarding the death of Manfred von Richtoven - so while Bailey cites undenialble proof - NOVA's documentary shows another side of the story claiming that RAF Flier Roy Brown did not and could not have shot down the ""Red Baron."" It includes autopsy reports and photos which neither showed nor described a head wound as cited by Bailey's claim.This review is made by author of Blood of Scotland, M.E. Grant."
positive,A must have for our dogs: We have two small dogs that are prone to hyperglycemia. We give this to them when they refuse to eat just to ensure their calorie count maintains the level that it should be. You won't catch us without this stuff on hand.
negative,Wrong DVD: I was really disappointed when I went to watch the Year without a Santa Claus. For some reason WB packaged it with the wrong version. So don't risk buying this and get the crappy new version.
negative,"Major FAIL: I had to stop after 15 min when the gum chewing mediaeval girls started saying ""YO! DUDE! FER SHURE~! DIG IT!being somewhat facetious but thats how it was"
positive,"Wow! A big jump from the third movie!: This movie is by far the best movie so far.After getting used to all the changes that were made in the 3rd movie, the fourth movie is a blast.The first thing I have to say is ""VOLDEMORT RULES!!!"" Whoever played Voldemort did an excellent job and you really learn to hate him (which is a good thing if you learn to hate the character and not the actor).The special effects rock and the acting is much better than I remember it being in the previous movies.I can't say much about the story because there's nothing new under the sun. As usual the director cut things, added things, and shortened things so as to make it not nearly as good as the books, but that's to be expected with all films that are based off of books.All in all this is a great movie that deserves to be bought off the shelf and watched over and over and over again."
negative,"Extremely graphic and detailed-cumbersome reading: The book outlays every detail of the Indiana 19th's movement during the Gettysburg campaign all of the way down the graphic depictions of death scenes. It was difficult to gain an overview of the regiments role within the larger conflict (which I anticipated) due to lengthy explanations of specific individuals movements. The details were thouroughly researched and presented in a very logical manner, but the importance the 19th played in this pivotal battle was underscored by long-winded explanations of each death that occurred during the three year period being studied. Approximately 1/3 of the books contents were detailed footnotes and this made the reading somewhat difficult."
negative,"worked great until it just STOPPED working at all!: I replaced an EPSON about 6 months ago that worked for about 9 months before the paperfeed went out. I thought I was ""movin' up"" by purchasing an HP, well, this one stopped working after 6 months: the printer carriage gets hung up on the right. I went to the website for troubleshooting options, none of which solved the problem....and the warranty is the biggest weakness...90-days! This alone speaks poorly of the expectations HP has of its own products. EPSON's warranty was 1 YEAR, but I had misplaced the receipt. SO, perhaps EPSON is a better deal, as long as you KEEP THE RECEIPT!"
negative,"Useless: When I got this book about a year or so ago, I was hoping for a handy reference to all of the 'difficult to remember' perl syntax. Specifically a nice reference on regular expressions, formats, common idiomatic programming (e.g.: sorting a hash by key or value), file tests, sprintf formats, etc.Instead you get a terse listing of most perl functions, regardless of if you'd ever use them. No syntactical hints or examples. No hints as to what they do. No hints as to how to accomplish what you want to do.You're better off making your own reference card(s) from a conglomeration of Programming Perl and the Perl Cookbook (both excellent books). Even the online (perldoc) reference is better than this book."
negative,"Cheaper but not cost effective: When paper costs rose significantly, I started shopping more carefully for all my paper products. What could go wrong with standard double-window envelopes? When I started using these, I had to adjust the print location for my Quickbooks check printing because the window wasn't quite located correctly. Then I discovered that the window placement is not consistent. Despite the adjustment, some windows are not displaying the first line of the vendor name/address block. Just as bad, the adhesive on these envelopes tastes ghastly.I will go back to Columbian envelopes despite the higher cost."
positive,Excellent Transaction.: The book arrived in the condition advertised and in a timely manner. I would do business with this vendor again.
negative,"I want to read a novel, not chants and song lyrics: I mean honestly, who here actually read word per word the numerous pages filled with chants/prayers and song lyrics? I'd turn the page to skip ahead and lo and behold - - more lyrics! eeks! I'd turn the page again and goodgollymissmolly! More lyrics! Over six pages of funeral song lyrics. Gee, how captivating. And what's with that long poem at the end of the book? What? Is Miss Auel trying to be hip? Hoping to score an MTV spot? Is she going to change her name to MC Auel? I've followed the entire series all these years. The endless sea of boring and needless details from this book has now confirmed this is the last book I'll read by Auel and whoever else attempted to help her write this snore of a story."
positive,"Lovely Book (forget what the PC say): This is a lovely book as are all of Dare Wright's. Forget what the one-star PC-types say, children understand more than you think and all you have to do is explain to them that spanking is ""something we don't do anymore and this was written a long time ago (1957)."" If they cannot read, just skip that part of the text. Fairy Tales contain more weirdo stuff. You cannot shelter children from literature or what the real world is like forever. They will only rebel and find it anyway, even small ones. I raised three well adjusted daughters so I'm not just speaking out of school."
positive,Awesome plot!: Hasselhoff has a dream sequence that stages the plot for one of the intelligent scripts I have ever seen. END
negative,OMG!!!: One of the top 10 worst books ever. Waded through 100 pages and decided life is way too short to waste it reading this gibberish. AVOID!!!!!
positive,"Great movie: This movie is wonderful, especially in 1080p HD! I have never even heard of, or read, the comic book this movie is based on, but I still enjoy the movie every time."
positive,"The start of a legend.....: Excellent A masterpieceSupersonic, Cigarrettes & Alcohol , Rock and Roll Star, Shakermaker, Slide away and obviously Live Forever are still going to be listened 30 years from now""I need to be myself I can`t be no one else """"You and I are going to live forever""Best band of the 90'sLa mejor banda de los 90's le pese a quien le pese"
positive,"Great and Surprising Characters: It is a book of its time, but the character description of the troubles of the main character's family and the families she works for as a governess are so entertaining. Read it for this."
negative,"The weakest of the 5 books.: Finally, I finished the book. This book is too long, with too little content. You feel you are reading the same paragraphs over and over until you have it memorized verbatim. There isn't an engaging story. Basically it's about Ayla getting introduced to Jondalar's people and travelling to the Summer Camp (similar to the story in The Mammoth Hunters) and having her baby. I was waiting for something interesting to happen in the book, but it never materialized."
positive,"Easy and fun to read: I'm just starting out learning about investing. This is the second book about money I read. I really enjoyed reading it and learned a lot. It's a great book for a beginner who wants to know more. If that's you, you'll be satisfied after you read it. I was. Now I can't wait to find more investing books. I have a big stack that I'm already reading. I'll keep this one on my bookshelf to look at again and again, though."
negative,"The second most overrated horror film next to ""The Shining"".: This 1974 low-budget horror ""classic"" is yet another overrated horror film. It may have started the slasher genre, but it's no ""Psycho"" or ""Halloween"". Those are the only two slasher films that are actually classics. ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is just stupid ... None of the teenagers in this film are ones that you care about. By the last half of the film, I wanted Sally [Marilyn Burns] to be sawed because all she did was scream for a whole hour. The cannibals were more sickening and laugh-inducing than scary. For a better serial-killer film, go for ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Psycho"" of course. Those films are subtle and truly, deeply scary. ""TCM"" is over-the-top, grainy, crude, and masochistic."
negative,"Boring: This is low grade, boring, exploitative rubbish. Only shocking to the thoroughly naive. It's high rating is a testament to the gullibility of the general public."
positive,"Emma: Emma is probably me favorite book by Jane Austin. I do not want to give away anything, but you must get to know this wonderful girl."
positive,"Great Start: Lets face it. The music industry would have NEVER discovered this young man. Gangly, southern, loves his mother... But he truly IS a pop star. This album proves it. The songs sound a tad bit over-produced and there really isn't an original 'feel' to this CD, but for some reason, my wife and I can't seem to get enough of it. We think because the CD underscores and carries the sincerity that shone through during his metamorphosis on American Idol. He's the long-shot that won (albeit second, he far outshines the rest). And this album is a winner of sorts. We'll buy his next one so we can continue to enjoy watching him grow and change as an artist. Just like he did on TV."
negative,This film is a disaster: Do not see if you want to preserve the wonder of the first two installments.
negative,"more labelling, please: This product came with a disclaimer that it contained substances known by the state of California to cause cancer . This disclaimer was not mentioned in the description, or I would not have purchased it. This is one of the drawbacks of buying online, a way of buying that I generally enjoy and approve of."
negative,"Dreary: Jean Auel has written 5 books in this series. This one is the poorest. It drags, page after page, it drags. It is repetitious to the point where I skipped whole paragraphs. Much of it is re-hashes the previous books. The sex appears to be added as an afterthought to relieve the boredom. I kept hoping, but nothing ever happened that grabbed my attention. ""Valley of the Horses"" was fascinating, it sits in my bookcase and I'll re-read every couple of years. Shelters of Stone I'll donate to the local libary."
negative,"still the same old guys...: Hello again, here we are. This is what I think after listening to the new album of Germanys' Thrash-Metal godfathers.Nothing new but still they rock like hell. Unfortunately they made a step backwards and not like Slayer or Mayhem a step forward. Well, I believe that some old school fanatics will enjoy this feature, but Sodoms'great days are gone. Their last good record was and will be ""Tapping the Vein"". I was a great fan of them for over 12 years but they just repeat themselves. I am not happy about giving such a cruel review about this record but I just had to say that. Sorry guys, better luck next time, ok?"
negative,"Not as smart as the website it's based on!: I was thrilled when I heard about this toy, because I love the website 20q.net , which is truly genius. Unfortunately this toy is not as smart as the website, perhaps due to memory constraints. The first two things I tried with it were ""a cardboard box"" and ""an alien"" and it didn't get either one. This is troublesome because the surprise and wonder of using the website comes from its ability to guess even the most obscure and outlandish things (a stork, a game boy). This toy cannot guess those things, so you must ask guests to choose more obvious things, taking the fun out of it. [...]."
positive,"Pretty entertaining: Bought this on a Lightning Deal, and have enjoyed it so far. There is a lot of content for the money and it is funny to see what Canadien Broadcasting was like several decades ago. Oh, and there is some good piano playing as well. Gould seems like he was an interesting, if not a little strange, person. It's sad that he died so young of a stroke."
positive,"Beautiful album from Peter Gabriel: Thsi cd has it all, great songs like ""Talk to me"", ""Washing in the water""and ""Secret world"". Also, some great hits, beautifully arranged and composed, the kind your not tired of after few years, like ""Blood of Eden"", ""Steam"", Digging in the dirt"" and ""Kiss that frog""Three songs, in my mind, are weaker, which are ""Love to be love"", ""Only us"" and ""Fourteen black painting"" I give it a four star rating, highly recommanded."
negative,"Complete garbage.: I had just bought this printer in May and it worked fine to begin with, now it's having the same paper jam and out of paper issues as almost all of the other people's printers are on this site..please, avoid this printer at all costs..all it does is give a person a headache trying to fix the problem. The only thing good about this machine is the printing quality, but that doesn't make up for the fact that it is a completely dysfunctional product. Had I read these reviews before purchasing, I would have never invested in this product..the sad thing is, I have previously owned a different HP model and it worked great..too bad this one wasn't the same."
positive,Good flavor to meat.: The bisquettes are very good and added flavor to the meat.I would recommend them to anyone wanting to use them.
positive,"American Theocracy,: American Theocracy by Kevin Philips should be on the reading list of every High School in America. K Philips brillantly explains(and foresees the current 2007-9 Real Estate bubble and recession)a lot of the troubles America is in now by going back to the past religious,political, and mercantil history of Europe and America. He weaves his facts with statistics,quotes and clever analysis.The recent rise of the religious right,its links to Oil and politics, the rise of the Financial milieux take-over of the US economy, the monstous debt weighing the average American consumer and the merger of the Republican Party with religious fondamentalists and creationists is troubling for a multitude of reasons. He deplores the new backwardness this creates in America(less Sciences more Faith based curiculums in schools)and the loss of our influence in the World.A fantastic read."
negative,"Overrated: Unless you like syrupy power ballads that all sound the same, I would save my money. Mr. Aiken is overrated and over-hyped."
negative,french connection: if this is the best transfer for a blue ray product the studio shold be ashamed of itself. I compared it to the original and guess which one was better.
positive,Awesome: This product was purchased because we went on vacation and borrowed a smaller version of this product. We then researched and noticed this particular product had everything that the other did and more. This thing is absolutely great. You also get a free update that is redeemable once. It is definitely worth its money. I would recommend this to anyone that travels.
negative,"Too bad: I've loved Santana for decades, and was excited to hear about the new album. And I even might have purchased it despite some of the less glowing reviews of the music.... But the copy protection stuff is the clincher for me - this CD is not going into my collection.If I can't rip it for use on my mp3 players and laptop, I'm not buying it, and I hope that many others (enough to make a dent in sales) feel the same way. I agree with a previous reviewer; please write Arista (and Santana) about this."
positive,"A good book but unrealalistic characters: The book was good but I felt that the characters were extremely unrealalistic. Nita, a thirteen-year old girl is beaten up by her peers. Thirteen!! Mabye for a eight or nine year old but for thirteen! Girls by thirteen have fights of words, not fists. Second of all, Nita's father wants her to fight back? Nita is thirteen and a girl. Why would a parent be encouraging their children anyways? Nita acts childish and her relationship with her sister is plain stupid. They never fight and are always helpful to eachother. In real life, sisters fight. It's a fact of life. I have one myself. This was a good read but Diane Duane needs to create more realistic characters."
negative,"Not another note from Another Dumb Blond, PLEASE !: Come on everyone, how can you be writing these praises of Hoku and her debut, ""Another Dumb Blond"". One of the few times Britney Spears outshines another artist can be found when comparing this single to any of Spears' works ! The lyrics speaks for themselves ! The entire song is nothing but ""make no sense"" lyrics and loud background music coming from a keyboard piano ! Not a catchy song, horrible music, no well written lyrics. Simply don't buy Hoku's, ""Another Dumb Blond"" unless you truly are another dumb blond !"
positive,Just as described: Book was in good shape. Gently used just as described. Recieved order in amount of time that was promised. Thanks!
negative,"DID NOT SCARE ME ONE BIT!: so i see the trailers to THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE on DVD and a narrator says that film critic rex reed called it ""the scariest movie i've ever seen"" (?--rex reed?!). leonard maltin rated it 3 stars; most critics like this horror flick while a lotta fans call it a cult classic. me? i finally viewed TCM in its entirety after seeing some scenes here and there. i didn't want to see it at 1st due to the gory stuff where leatherface slices and dices everyone in sight. i was very surprised it wasn't that bloody yet i was very bored by it. and there was 1 gal who just didn't know how to shut her screaming up towards the end when she was kidnapped by leatherface and his creepy cannibal family. must've lasted a 1/2 hr and no laryngitis! i just wasn't interested in TCM and why the heck 3 sequels and this just in, why even bother do a new remake of this junk that is due out late 2003?! nice features on the DVD though."
negative,"Just a reprinted photocopy of USED 1946 edition with UNDERLINING: This is the worst quality book I have ever purchased. The publisher (it appears to be booksllc.net) just photocopied at 1946 Oxford University Press edition, complete with faded print and the previous owner's UNDERLINING (!!!!), and made a print run. I will be returning this outrage immediately and purchasing the 1958 Oxford edition instead."
positive,"Valuable comparison piece to modern studies.: I read this for the first time when I was in sixth grade and it continues to be one of my favorite books on the 1920's.I will agree that maybe it's not the best place to start for a complete Jazz Age neophyte because it requires the reader to get over his/her modern-day attitudes, but after a little starter research, it's fascinating.Obviously, since it was first published in 1931, it lacks long-term analysis, which some people might find frustrating. Personally, I think that the fact that it was written when these events and views were still so fresh, and that it does not have modern ideas projected onto it, makes it a valuable and interesting comparison to later perspectives on the decade."
positive,"What a series!: I liked this even more than the Time Master Trilogy; the characters have more personality, and the stakes are higher. A fantastic read!"
positive,"Johnny Shiloh.: Such a great movie worth the wait, remember it well from years ago though still keeps me posted to the screen. Worth having in your collection a real gem."
positive,"Excellent overview: This overview of the trio's songs is excellent, although if you own the Motown Hits anthologies, you already own 75% of the songs. Has rare mono mixes of Freda Payne's ""Band Of Gold"" and the Chairmen Of The Board's ""Give Me Just A Little More Time."" Informative liners notes."
positive,Great Effort: Simply one of the better bands around today. Do yourself a favor and pick any of their music. I'm sure you'll find it a pleasant surprise.
negative,"A disappointment!: The title is misleading. There is no joy, no discussion, no valuable information. It's just a list of juicing recipes."
negative,"Broke after 5 years of light use, see one of the images, bike damaged: One of the legs broke in two, the bike flew off the rack on a highway at 70mph, damaged beyond repair. Don't get this plastic piece of crap. Look at the image, its hollow inside, there is no reinforcement of any kind."
positive,"Nice: This is nice, it looks a little different from what I thought it would look like. Otherwise, very nice."
negative,"Looks great but not doesn't perform so great: The case is gorgeous but so easy to scratch. The FM tuner quality was horrible. It was like listening to internet radio with all the static. The Audio manager was annoying to handle, impractical. There were bugs in the program which stopped me from listening to all of my songs. You also have to pay for the program if you want to transfer songs from a CD (even mp3 ripped CDs) to the player. Samsung would have gladly attempted to fix the problem but I just had enuff."
positive,Delta Force Extreme-----AWESOME: I can't tell you how much fun this game is. The graphics are great and the realism is also top notch. I play on the interent with others from around the world and just have a great time with it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes first person shooter games!
positive,"FIts and covers: The fit isn't great, but it covers it, it's cheap and easy to install. It does protect the delicate screen very well, though the cover can come off if tossed into a bag loose, a rubber band cures that when needed."
positive,"Amazing - Motivates kids to eat healthy and be more active!: How many ways are there to get our children to read, eat healthy, and be more active? Answer - NONE, until I found Race Against Junk Food. The story is wonderful, action packed but non-violent, and it gently moves a child's belief system into a mode that encourages a healthy lifestyle. What could be better? Read it with your child and see if you don't become more active and eat more fruits and vegetables (and leave that couch & cheeseburger behind)."
negative,"Typical new Asia - trying to re-write history: Anthology, like the great Communist purges of 1930s and 40s, appears to be an attempt to act as if the past never happened. Why else would Geoff Downes think he could get away with re-recording the band's best-known hits with a singer-guitarist (John Payne) who can't hold a candle to either John Wetton or Steve Howe? Payne's re-makes are embarrasing, and the new stuff is woefully poor; as dreadful as the new material on ""Then & Now"" was, I'd rather listen to that compared with anything this disc has to offer."
positive,"Intex Pillow Rest Airbed: This is the exact product we were looking for. It's compact, self filling, and pretty comfortable. It's perfect for traveling or when company spends the night. It provides the extra sleeping accommodations we needed. The 120v pump fills the bed quickly. The battery pump or foot pump wouldn't have worked well for us."
negative,"This movie is not for the deaf to enjoy, because no CC: I am a deaf person and really enjoyed watching the first two movies with closed caption. I'm very disappointed that this movie don't even have closed caption in it. I noticed that the ones with closed caption have Walt Disney label on it. Obiviously this one doesn't. I know other deaf people would enjoy watching it. BUT it will be disappointing for them not able to watch and understand the movie. So I'm asking you PLEASE consider to have your movie closed caption. Thank you"
negative,"Death DuJour: Too much swearing! Books do not need all that to make a good story, it is very distracting"
negative,"Boring, boring, boring!: Perhaps I'm just reacting to how old this is, but I found it to be boring. Yet I've watch others made in that time and they are still enjoyable and very interesting. I couldn't get into this one at all and felt that I was about three or four steps ahead of the plot all the way along."
negative,"coffee mugs?: Of the six glass mugs, I have two left, And am very careful if I use them for any kind of liquid I put in it, be it cold or hot,seams will leak,If the liquid is hot it will split the cup,Do not enjoy a hot coffee bath, As far as I am conserned its a waste of money, but it is your life. not impressed. B.Uzzell Arvada, Colordo"
positive,"Great adventure story!: I friend of mine recommended this book and told me it was his favorite book of all time. He also said to make sure you get the unabridged version. (It is over 1400 pages long, but after the first 300-400 pages you will be glad it is so long.) Not only does this book have incredible insight into the human condition, it is also a very exciting tale of escape and revenge as well as a great ""trip"" to Europe. You will be amoung ""bandits"" in the ruins of Rome, high society Europe during Carnival, Parisian society as well as sea faring trips with smugglers through coastal Spain and Italy."
negative,"did not hold my child's attention: not sure why, but this movie just did not hold my child's attention. he enjoys baby mozart etc., baby songs, and usually sits still, enthralled by a movie when i put one on. this one just did not hold his attention."
negative,"Tiger Claws 3: For anyone hoping to see Cynthia Rothrock reprise her roles in Tiger Claws One and Two, this movie will be disappointing. Ms. Rothrock makes only a cameo appearance in this film. One gets the definite impression that her appearance was more about box office than about improving the film. The movie itself is not the worst of its genre. Although there is some woefully sad acting in the non-fighting segments. The action is pretty good with Jalal Merhi serving as the protagonist. Cynthia fans would only want this video to complete their collection, not for the pitiful amount of time she appears in this film."
positive,Great Movie!!! Ü: I have the video but not the DVD I would buy the DVD but it is in WIDESCREEN and I HATE WIDESCREEN! I agree with a lot of you I love the music but some of the costumes was a little much. I wanted the soundtrack (the CD) to be like the movie (I mean the motion picture) instead of the Original Canadian Cast Recording.
positive,"Book: it is in good shape and also very interesting book,i recommend this book, looking forwardto buy more books online :)"
negative,"Unintelligent, trying waste of time.: Not enjoyable. Made it through the first hour with rarely a laugh, and then gave up. Zero enjoyment. Terrible movie."
positive,Nice for a boy or girl: I like this crib set alot. I bought it for my first baby. It is for a boy. The colors on this set are real nice but is more of a yellow and yellow-green then green. I was hoping for more green but I am still not disapointed.
positive,"Perfect rice, every time: This rice cooker is so easy to use: decide how many cups of rice to make, throw it in, put in water up to the line that matches the number of cups of rice, close the lid and plug it in, and you're done. Total cooking time for one cup of white rice, which is about right for two people, is about 15-20 minutes. We've noticed that leaving the rice in the cooker for an extra 10 minutes after it switches to ""warm"" produces perfect rice almost every time.Buy this cooker and stop trying to cook rice in a pot. Perfect rice with no effort is no longer just a dream."
negative,cheap diapers: I typically use the pampers swaddlers and thought this would be a good cheaper alternative. These diapers tended to give off gel balls more and worst of all did not have a wetness indicator. Although the swaddlers are more expensive they're definitely worth the money.
positive,"WOW: This is quite simply the best single electronic album I have ever heard. Even friends who aren't into electronic can get into this album. The track transitions are seamless, as this album absolutely reflects the time Sasha invested in it."
negative,"NO reshipping? automatically REFUND?: HOW COME IS IT POSSIBLE?I bought this things and cafelatte taste, cell activator, personal protein x3... I don't recommend this seller definitely,,I assert seller should learn how to treat the buyer!I paid money about 172$.... products price was about 133$...(includes taxes)I didn't agree with my refund,but they just do that.... OMG.......W.WI wasn't at home, no body can't get the packages, but I request reshipping,they said, they can't reship before reorder, so we has processed your refundis it resasonable? NO NO NO NO NO No !!!!!!!!!!! I don't think so. I am so exploded...I LOST MY MONEY ABOUT 70$... IF I WERE YOU, I AM NOT GONNA BUY STUFFS FROM THIS SELLER.In the other hand, my other seller said,"" we will reship your package when i get your package"" no adding shipping feehow different both sellers~"
negative,"Miserable mis-rendering!: As one who finds Johanna Spyri's ""Heidi"" to be one of the best children's books, I find this transition to melodrama dreadful, and totally untrue to the book's text. The independent Heidi, whose warmth and faith are such that she is fearless and completely kind, is reduced to a picture book moppet. Worse yet, characters such as Dete and Fraulein Rottenmeir, who, in the book, are respectively rather self-centred and puzzled at the lower class child, are depicted as totally wicked - ready to sell Heidi to the gypsies! Clara, who in the original is disabled more because of her elders' fear and over-protectiveness than because of her unnamed illness, now is the target of a wicked governess who has a financial interest in keeping her ill and weak.This dreadful film is suited only to those who are die hard fans of Shirley Temple."
positive,"[BOOM!]: Sodom Came, they went.I had listened to 'Masquerade In Blood' and 'Till Death Do Us Unite' and I knew the war that was Sodom was over, the ceasefires had been signed. When you end an album with a song called ""Hey Hey Rock 'n' Roll Star"" after putting out crap that just screams ""We wanna be punk and are failing miserably at it!"" I knew it was over. Saddened, I went to survey the damage.And That's when I heard the Air Raid Sirens.Code Red is the comeback album of all time. Sodom has snapped back into place, I don't know why, but they're rocking harder and heavier than they ever have. This is not for ""Limp Bizkit"" fans, you get your ears and a greater part of your head ripped off and handed to you. And that's the way it should be.Notable Tracks are Liquidation, The Vice of Killing, Code Red, and Addicted to Abstinance."
positive,I love it: It can do so many things! I thought this was a space boombox from the future when I first got it. It is so cool.
positive,Inflated Price: This is a nice watch but beware which listing here you purchase from since the price direct from from Fossil is only $105.00.
negative,"Poorly written: What a disappointment this was!!! The story goes on and on, but doesn't go anywhere. The worst I've read. Waste of my money!"
positive,"Brain candy: Yes, this book is brain candy. Potato chips for the mind. So what? Not every book has to be freakin' ""War and Peace"". Mr. Ringo gives us the ultimate adolescent fantasy -- a super-warrior with a harem, his own band of warriors, all the weapons & gadgets he wants, Presidential support, his own brewery, and millions of dollars. (Having read what I just wrote, I feel a strong urge to shout, ""Dude! Chicks and money and guns! And beer!Awesome!"" I'll try to restrain myself. Heh.)While the sex scenes are a bit overdone, the novel itself is quite enjoyable. I read it while stuck in an 8-hour plane ride; and I must say it was very entertaining. If you want a fast-paced, action-filled story that'll keep your interest, this book is for you."
positive,"Best book ever!: First off, let me say I used to be an aggressive go-getting with guys. I mean a girl should be able to go after what she wants right?--- and for whatever reason... it doesn't work.. .that's when I read the book. This book literatly changed my life! It makes perfect sense. I have read numurous books on dating/love, but this one takes the cake.. if you're contimplating buying it-- DO IT. It's 100% worth the money, and it will give you a new attitude towards yourself and dating. It really helps you keep your sanity when you start dating a guy, and by holding back somet in the beginning, it helps you get what you want in the end.. it's really the best book out there!Ps. I have tried to get my ""depressed/pathetic/obsessed with getting married and guys can sense it "" friends to read it... and they have rejected the advice. They are still single, and very confused why. To put it clear, it will work for 90% of normal girls, but if the adj. above describe you, you may not like it."
positive,Good Quality but little tight: I bought two of them. Good price and it does what it needs to do but could be more comfortable/
positive,"The Longest Day: I am buying this dvd for the grandson for Christmas, so it is hard to say is it ok. The transaction was great and price was good."
negative,"an extreme emotional ride: If you want to watch a movie where a couple meets, falls in love, gets married, almost breaks up, have cat fights, get angry, make up, has new problems, lie to each other, hurt each other again, almost break up, really do break up, cry, yell at each other, cry again, then finally make up because there's not really anything else to do - then this is the movie for you.If you do, for some reason, decide to watch this, watch it to the point where they get married -THEN TURN IT OFF (being bollywood, thats about the length of a regular movie anyway)."
positive,The worlds greatest book: I first read The Hobbit in Elementry school. Ever since then it has been my favorite book. It is a tale of fantastic adventure and is told exceptionally well by the author J.R.R. Tolkien. This book is for young and old. It is a magnificent piece of work and it shall be cherished for ever.
positive,"Sara Dane: I loved the book, it was extremely enspiring and showed the true strength of the character (Sara) and described the beauty that Australia was and still is with such perfection. It was breathtaking and I have already read it 5 times this year!!"
negative,"NO GOOD: Bought this for the Christmas lights 1 for outside and one for the tree,works great EVEN WITH EVERY OTHER REMOTE YOU HAVE WILL TURN IT ON OR OFF,AND DRIVE YOU CRAZY!!!!THE CAR REMOTE/ GARAGE/ HANDY SWITCHES ALL TURNED THE LIGHTS ON"
negative,Plasplug is JUNK!!: By something else. This is the worst piece of machinery I have ever bought. Virtually impossible to cut any size tile on the diagonal. Typical imported junk!!!!!
negative,"The Olsens' movies are just getting more and more pathetic!: I'm very, very sorry to say this, but THIS MOVIE IS RIDICULOUS. THERE IS NO PLOT, NO MORAL LESSON, NO NOTHING. I can understand the part how Sam and Emma switch teams because they were upset with how they were placed, but after that it was like, hello? Where's the rest of the story? The acting was pretty good but the actual plot (or lack of it) totally stunk!"
positive,"Moby - Everything Is Wrong: As much of the music released by moby, This Album is spectacular. Each songs fits well with the next. Sweet beats are well mixed with many different tempos. Specifically, the song everything is wrong is slow paced, but portrays a great deal of emotion throughout it. Overall, Any Moby fan would enjoy this Album."
positive,Looking forward to movie: I am looking forward to the movie but nothing really compares to a book. This book should be a must read for everyone. My ten year old daughter is reading it also.
positive,"Shower Fanatastic!!!!: Had to replace our shower head, went through two others before we found the April Shower APHH Handheld Filtered shower head, and oh my. It's everything all the reviewers say, incredible power and noticeably smoother hair/skin post shower. Going to buy five more."
positive,"A DEFINITE HIT: Start to finish a great listen...Not one track disappoints, unlike other CD's where you skip a few tracks to get to the ""good songs"", each track on ""The Madding Crowd"" is tight and hooks you in immediately. Very refreshing."
negative,"Gullibility has no limits: This is literally incredible. I mean it lacks a scintilla of credibility. How far does someone have to go with wild, speculative, unsupportable, obviously illogical theories before every human being, even the most gullible, would say ""do you think . . . nahh!"" Clearly we as a people are desperate to find meaning, even if we have to impose the most inane theory imaginable on our world. And how convenient that it asks so little of us: Look! We're already mostly water! That alone makes us deep! Please, people: get a grip! We have real problems to address that won't be fixed by feeling all gooey about being all wet."
positive,"Perfect Christmas gift!: Very happy with purchase. Item was shipped fast, nicer than expected and the price was very reasonable. Ping to be a nice Christmas gift."
negative,"Not for me.......: I bought this after reading about all the benefits of swaddling but after using it a few times I realized that this was not for my baby. I live in the Caribbean and quite frankly swaddling is not commonly done here. The nurses do it in the hospital but it is not taught or suggested for home use. I never did it with my first child but decided to give it a go for my son.The first time I used it(during his first week at home), he slept in it ok for a while but when he awoke and found that his movements were constricted he cried non stop until I removed him from it. My mom absoluted hated this thing and compared it to being in a straight jacket and she was convinced that it was keeping it too hot.I gave in and stopped using it. I guess this is a cultural thing and may work for some but I am sorry to say it was not a hit in our home."
positive,"Romeo & Julliette: I saw this when I was about 12 or 13 in school for English literature class. I was so moved and touched by it's beauty and the loveliness of the main actors. I have never seen it again despite looking for it. so, when I saw it was for sale I had to own it to show it to my son who is approaching 12 years now."
negative,"Just not good: I thought this album was horrible. I am not at all impressed by his wit in songwriting, and the production was extremely underdeveloped. I like a good garage band; don't get me wrong, but each song just has so much more potential. I feel like the real irony of the album is not in the lyrics, but in the album title: The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living didn't seem like it took too much effort.I am scared to buy another album by The Streets, but something tells me that there has to be a better album out there... right?"
negative,"Very disappointing: I got the book hoping to learn the human experience of such an amazing challenge. An experience like that must have such a profound impact on a man's psyche, but I felt he masked all of this with shallow quips and wordsmithing. Way too much salesmanship and way too little reality."
negative,Doesn't work! Cheaply made.: Bought this as one of the toys for my 4 year old's birthday. The mouth does not shut even with all the teeth pressed down. Very frustrating for him as he doesn't see any point to the game. We've tried it several times but no luck. And sometimes not all the teeth stay down so we're not sure if they're supposed to stay down or rebound back up. The spring inside makes a weird clicking sound so I'd assume it's broken. I wish I had taken the negative reviews seriously. Sometimes I luck out with a product even with bad reviews but not this time. It really does not work. Quite disappointing. Make sure it's not the 'only' gift so they can get distracted with the others that actually do work.
negative,"not original: First, I do think that this writer did have a good writing style, wich is why he gets at least 2 stars, however, the characters, especially the main character had NO PERSONALITY!!! He was so... characterless, I actually didn't care wherther he died or not! Also this books lacks originality. If this is one of this first fantasy books you've read then you might not be as dissapointed, but this book copied soooo many other fatasy books. It could actually be a fan fiction. I was really frusterated by the fact that he got so much publicity with this book, and yet... it's nothing original or special. On the other hand, the author is a good story teller. I was never bored while reading the book, but I was deffinatly dissapointed."
negative,"This is music these days?: I just wanted to be able to write my review now before others do so hopefully you'll see this. To be 100% truthful i would say that i did not enjoy this cd for even a second. I can't stand people-critics-whatever, say that this is ""hip"" these days and these two artists are trying to ""bring back the sounds of the past"" if you ask me this cd is just pure rubbish, it furthermore proves that as time progresses, it takes less and less talent to form a band. This is what you get what you scrape two artists from the bottom of the barrel, teach them a couple chords (just enough to play with modest mouse and incubus) and watch it all crash and burn. Maybe i'm just a tad harsh, it just angers me when music is this bland and a lack of talent is so clear... I hope this is the only arthur and yu cd to come and i hope noone gets any inspiration from these two either..."
negative,"Obviously a Liberal: I am upset that I had to give this author money. This book was required for school, and it is biased. Schneider attacks the Bush administration often. This is ridiculous, there should be both sides in a school book."
negative,clip case: it does protect your phone but it started cracking after only having it for two weeks so if you plan on it being used every day plan on replacing it soon.
negative,"killed by the ending: I read this book and thought I had an understanding of the characters. Then we get to the last quarter of the book and everything is completely unexpected except for the killer. I had that figured out in the beginning. I don't believe true suspense in mysteries is achieved by having characters in the end doing completely unexpected, out of character things."
negative,"Burned Up!: Be advised before you buy a TiVo product.I bought this item from Amazon but when it arrives I find that I need to connect to the TiVo Service to complete the setup (can't use device until setup is complete). I don't have a house phone and the network is on the other side of the house so I go to Best Buy and get TiVo wireless connector.Upon getting the wireless set up it tells me that it can't find my network so I call Technical Support. Support tells me that I have to set up an account with TiVo and pay them $12.95/mo so I can use my own machine. I don't want the service. All I want to do is use the DVR. ""Well,"" the lady says, ""if you don't sign up for the service the machine won't work."""
positive,title: Got what was ordered and expected in timely fashion! word word word word word word word word word word word
positive,"Not as bad as some portray...: As a long time reader of fantasy and science fiction, I'm not sure I understand the complete disgust some of the reviewers are feeling concerning this book. For me, Eragon is a good fill in as my post-LOTR:RotK-high wanes, and I anxiously await the next installment in Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I've read Tolkien, McCaffery, Lackey, Tad Williams, and many others. The fact that many elements are obviously taken from these greater works didn't take any enjoyment away from my reading. Not an epic, I agree, but not a waste of time. For those people who have found books of a Tolkien-esque scale intimidating in their size and vocabulary, I think this is a good start to get into the genre. If you are well aquainted with fantasy novels, this is a nice Saturday afternoon read when you just want to read something for the fun of it."
positive,Not the best but still up there: This movie is the 3rd of the films where Anne is all grown up. Her imagination and talkative self have settled down but the temper is still there and the adventures are also. The War was very historic and made the movie a challenge but not quite what I was expecting. The first two are the best and the third...well it is the third. So please enjoy the movie and you will see a bit of the young Anne in a few scenes which makes it seem like the other two.
positive,Eragon: I am almost finished with the first book and can't wait to get to the next book. Can't beleive the auther started at age 15 with this book. Look forward to many years of good reading from Christopher Paolini.
positive,"Emotional Journeys: Amazing story that touches on the raw experience of love, how it can go wrong, perception, the pain of recognition and forgiveness."
positive,"Run Lola Run: This film is amazing... not only is the cinematography masterfully done, but also the many layers of the entire film. I especially love it on DVD because I can hear the director and Franka's opinions about the film. Also, wide screen... need I say more?"
positive,Mission Impossible 1: Great movie to add to the DVD collection and Tom Cruise is such a good actor which shows in the majority of his movies.
negative,"An Enemy of the People: There are two versions of this play by Henrik Ibsen on film in English. One made in 1977 with Steve McQueen un the starring role of Dr. Stockman, and a 1990 made for TV version, produced for PBS on an adaptation by Arthur Miller and with John Glover in the role of Dr. Stockman. The 1977 version with Steve McQueen is far superior. In the 1990 version John Glover is much too hyper. He is often just plain silly--or even stupid--and he does not make standing up for truth appear very noble. Actually, this film nullifies the entire intent of the play as written by Ibsen in that it discredits the whole idea of standing up for truth and right.Steve McQueen's performance is sensitive to Ibsen's original intent, a very fine piece of work.I would strongly recommend that anyone considering purchase of this film insist on getting the 1997 Steve McQueen version.I would have to struggle to give the John Glover version two stars. For Steve McQueen I would happily assign five."
positive,"Not like the video game, but still fun!: This movie has received a lot of unfair criticism. Mostly, the problem is that this movie derrived from a video game. Some people dislike it because it comes from a video game and others hate it because it is too unlike the game. Admittedly, if there were some name and costume changes, this movie could be called something besides ""Super Mario Bros."".In any case, how good would the movie be if it featured a little plumber running through a bunch of turtles and jumping on to a flagpole? If it were too similar to the video game, many viewers would turn away (however, its unlikeness to the game has turned away some gamers). In any case, this movie is a lot of fun to watch. The characters are spirited and, as it says on the box, it's a blast to watch."
positive,love these classics: i have so much fun watching these with my toddler at christmas. love these classics! great value for so many movies.
positive,A Great Testimony to the Power of God: This book is based on a true story. A true testimony to the power of God. The kind of transforming power still available today. The impact of this true story has continued to touch and change lives forever. The movie is also very powerful if you get the chance to view it. Thank God for men and women who continue to listen to God's voice in a time that many naysayers say the sitution is hopeless.
positive,"good product w/ bottle design failure: The bottle press doesn't allow air intake, which means the more lotion you squeeze out, the more distorted the container will be. Because It's odd that such a good product comes with bad bottle design."
positive,"Radiator replacement: The radiator cost half of what it cost at parts stores.So far no leaks except a rubber stopper they use was thin,cracked and leaked.I had a feeling it would so I carried a spare $1.00.I do recomend this product anyway.The shipping was prompt,with no hassles."
negative,This book is very light...no substance: The good stuff is elsewhere ($ -> Rational) is the basic premise of this book. I would have to say that if you want an introduction to RUP then this is definitely that but no more. Don't expect it to do more than familiarize you with the general concepts of RUP. Almost every chapter ends with which tools you should buy from Rational.
positive,"Need to give Prodigy a break....: Everyone seems to hate this single but I really like it and I have gotten my roommate into liking prodigy just because of this single. I would agree that it is a bit lacking but I wouldn't guess that they've been trying to make a cd for 6 years, guys. They have to have gone vacation or just a break in general after the Dirtchamber sessions came out. So I would say that's a bit unfair to make that claim. Anyways I'm a diehard prodigy fan and own almost every single song they've put out (except the What Evil Lurks E.P) and I would suggest anyone who is like me to pick up this single."
positive,"great set!: this set is big! it's very well made, the pieces are nice, the board is durable. I would recommend this set, especially for the price!"
negative,"Disappointing: I don't doubt that this book has some helpful tips for parents with introverted children but just getting through the book in the first place was difficult. And while I do believe parents should help in some ways, the idea that you should change your whole way of doing things just to fit your introverted child is not going to help them when they get out in the real world and the real world does not cater to them like mommy and daddy did."
positive,xinhua dictionary chinese / english translation: i got this for my son who wants to go to china. he is pleased and is starting to speak a little of the language already. good book.
positive,"Beautiful West: Never read a Zane Grey novel so when it was offered on my Kindle for free I decided to give it a try. I was surprised that such a ""vintage"" book would be so relevant to current day. It is full of beautiful description and passion for the West and its scenery. I enjoyed the well written story and was surprised by the woman's journey into a life with purpose. Will read more of this series of books."
positive,"Great Mix: This book is not for the beginner, but for one who is eager to move beyond an intermediate or beginner stage in classical music. One of my first guitar teachers used this method. Twenty years later, I can still pick my recital tunes like it was yesterday. Well worth the money if you're willing and able to dedicate the time."
negative,"wow. this is a boring movie....: a friend loaned this to me over the weekend and i watched it on my laptop while enroute from LAX to JFK. after the first 30 minutes, i had the urge to quit and do something else as this is really a boring movie. the plot is predictabile, the same machine vs. men, humanity and love to all, hug the tree kind of deal. as i already 'wasted' over half an hour on this movie, i decided to stay put and finish the movie... only to find out that the boredom continued. even worse, this movie has no humor, takes itself too seriously as if the director has something to preach..... come to think of it, one star is too much but then, this is the lowest rating Amazon has for us. can we have negative 5 stars in the future?"
positive,"TERRIFIC BOOK: I saved my job by reading this book. One of my co-workers and I were having a difficult time getting along. I loved my job, but this friction between the two of us was really starting to bug me and although the job market is tight right now, I had decided to float my resume around and see what was out there.BUt, I went to the bookstore and saw CRUCIAL CONFRONTATIONS. It had so much great advice on how to deal with confrontation in a positive way. By using the books advice, I was able to ""confront"" my co-worker and I realized we really were not that far apart in opinions...we just expressed them differently. It would be a stretch to say that we will be best friends, but I do think we have reached a common ground and I no longer feel the need to leave my job.Go buy this book if you are have difficulty in your job. marriage or family...It is worth every penny."
negative,"Quite a Disappointment: I LOVE the Anne of Green Gables series, I own Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea on DVD and I cherish them both. I watched The Continuing Story when it first aired on television and I was heart-broken. It strays from the books, and it felt like such a departure from the other two stories. Even the actors reprising their roles didn't quite fit. I was so sad! I wanted to love it as completely as the first two stories, but I kept getting distracted by Anne's now raspy voice, as if she has smoked quite a few more cigarettes than she should, and by Gil's sickly appearance. I really worry for his health and lifestyle! I recommend buying the first two movies in the series without hesitation, but skip The Continuing Story for sure!"
positive,"Chicken Soup for the Spiritually Hungry: Althought the layout takes getting used to, by the 4th or 5th page one can get thoroughly absorbed in the text and the words of wisdom.Nizamuddin Awliya was a great Muslim Saint of the Chishti spiritual order during the Moghul-Indian era. He was a spiritual inheritor of Baba Fariduddin Ganj Shakr and of Khwaja Muinuddin Chisti of Ajmer. Among his famous disciples was Amir Khusroe, the famous sufi poet.While this is a collection of his sayings to his students and people of the era, much of the advice is timeless.Bruce lawrence has made a good effort in keeping the mood of the text and this is a book not only for those interested in Sufism, but as a book of inspiration and comfort ."
positive,Funny and all around Great!!!!!!: Larry the Cucumber makes this cd hilarious!!!!!This is a great Christian cd with great music that you can sing along with and never get tired of. You are bound to enjoy this cd! It has great life lessons just like the movies. I recommend this cd to any one of any age. You will definetly enjoy!
positive,"A unique piece of history: A veteran ABC Newcaster during the turmoil in the south in the 60's and 70's and an individual who met and befriended H Ross Perot, Murphy Martin gives in inside look from his vantage point of the events of Martin Luther King, the Kennedy Assination and some of Ross Perot's most incredible exploits. It is well written and full of interesting tidbits of the personalities of the day."
negative,"Deceptive: Deceptive, this is a book with a strong religious content. It assumes the reader has a strong reliance in God to solve his/her anger issues."
positive,"Great Book: The book was delivered in perfect condition and vey quickly. Having read the book I would totally recommend it. Informative, complete but maybe not ideal for a newbie."
negative,"I agree with all the 1 star ratings: This movie was a real snoozer with no real plot. Brosnan's character is too cool for school, which was annoying. The only thing going for it was Jamie Lee Curtis .... For an older lady. She's still ... nice ...."
positive,"good, not the best: I've watched every episode since the first and I think that this is a good one, but not the best. Now I'm watching the last season and It's amazing It's recovered the essence of begining."
positive,"Great quick read: Read this book many years ago in high school, but had forgotten all but the basic plot. I guess reading it for pleasure (vs assignment) gave me the opportunity to really think about the quality of writing as I read. Great quick read with a thought provoking conclusion."
positive,"An amazing novel. Truly a classic.: Middlemarch is such a wonderful book. I just finished reading it for a Victorian Fiction class in college, and it was amazing. It made me laugh, cry, and think about how beautiful life and love are. I now know why it is such a classic, and I feel re-affirmed in my decision to be an English major!"
positive,"THE BEST BOOK EVER!: This is my favorite book! I loved it! Everyone should read it, even people that aren't very interested in horses! This book is very good to read, once you start reading it, you can't stop. It is a wonderful book with a great theme. I would DEFINITELY recommend this book to anyone!"
positive,"MOVE OVER SPIDER MAN 1!: SPIDER MAN 2 KNOCKS THE FIRST ONE OUT OF THE PARK! ONE JAW-DROPPING ACTION SCENE AFTER THE NEXT! BUT THE DIRECTOR WISELY EMPHASIZES CHARACTER DEVELOPEMENT OVER THE ACTION AND REALLY PUTS A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR FEELINGS! SO YES, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, A SEQUEL WITH A BETTER STORY THAN THE FIRST. OH YEAH! THIS IS THE ONE TO SEE FOR THE SUMMER FOLKS. FOR YOU ACTION JUNKIES, TWO BLEW THE FIRST ONE AWAY. FOR YOU PEOPLE DESIRING A GOOD STORY, LOOK NO FURTHER. ONE FOR JJ!"
negative,"not the one I ordered: I have always recived what i ordered, but this one was not ..I ordered the hi rise, but recieved one way to short to the ground..it was to much trouble to send back, Im too old..I was dissapointed as now I can,t use it..husband can , but I can,t..be careful you get the right product..."
negative,briliant: This is probbably the best book i have ever read.it starts of good and gets better.it keeps geting better and the end is the best bit.if i had not read this book i would read it again.there are so many good bits.
positive,"Don't Pass This One Up: This is a first, truly a first....The FIRST time I purchased an album that had NO throwaway songs. Every single cut is fantastic. Some are edgy, some are inspiring, some are lyrical, fun and upbeat... But all are just beautifully pleasing to the ear (and the heart). Clay Aiken... you sure deliver!"
positive,"Not a Hollywood Expose: Anyone who wants to know a little bit more about Beatrix Potter, the person, will be pleased with this book. Through real-life annecdotes John Heelis conveys what should be obvious but isn't - Beatrix Potter was not a perfect human being, she had tiny flaws just like the rest of us. Sometimes she got cranky, occasionally she was absent-minded with her head in the clouds but mostly she was wonderful - although quite strong willed and opinionated.Those who are fascinated by Beatrix Potter will find the little book a great addition to their library. However, be forewarned - those who are buying this book for a voyeristic look into the intimate details of Beatrix Potter's married life will be sorely disappointed. This very private woman's private life remains private."
negative,It Didn't Work For Me: I bought this transmitter thinking it was similar to my old one that I had which unfortunately broke after MUCH use. This transmitter was terrible. It never held the transmission. Very frustrating and disappointing. Luckily I saved the packaging and returned it.
positive,"Winning the war against the NYC Subway: Anyone who travels on the NYC subway knows they can blow out their ears trying to listen to music over the subway noises. The Sennheister PXC 300 was given to me for XMas, and it has been a godsend.Pros:By my estimation (hardly scientific) the headphones cancel about 75% of the lower frequency noise on the subway. I get an instant boost in the quality of the music, while canceling out most of the mechanical noises. I will still hear some speech and mechanical noise, but it's no comparision.Very comforable.Cons:The mechanism holding the noise-cancelling circuits and batteries is seperate from the phones, and can be cumbersome. I usually clip it to my shirt.Case is not well organized."
positive,Great Product: I already use the Emu oil and thought this might work on my face! Wasn't sure as my face is very sensitive to topical moisturizers. I was pleasantly surprised that I did not break out and this has worked phenominally! I would recommend you try this on especially dry skin!
positive,"5 stars is not enough for this book: 'The Count of Monte Cristo' is, in my opinion, the greatest book ever written. The first time I read it, I was 13. I was at summer camp and read the book in 3 days. I'm 19 now and I have read it around 15 times. I never get tired of the story. I love how Dumas writes subplots that all get entwined all through the book. I've read the abridged version, too. It's not even close to being as good as the original. If you only read the abridged one, you'll miss a lot of the plot that is very important. Anyways, I love this book so much and I want everyone else to too!"
negative,"Is this book a joke?: A book written on ""valuation of swaps and swaptions"" is obviously not for the lay man. I was extremely disappointed to go through this book, which seems to be fit for 5th graders. It's a shame that a supposed leading thinker like Fabozzi can write such a shallow, meaningless book. Mr. Fabozzi, please name one practitioner who cares to use this good-for-nothing book of yours. Perhaps a better title for the book would have been, ""Swaps and swaptions for dummies""."
positive,"WOW, WOW, WOW: beautiful, heartfelt, and the best voice in the world...this cd is absolutly amazing and your right 5 starts is far from enough..clay aiken, he finally came along and showed everyone what real music and talent is about.Im so glad that i can listen to his music, and its not like the junk you hear on the radio from people who cant sing.BEAUTIFUL there no other words to explain it"
positive,"Just what we were looking for: My husband uses this as an exercise mat. After daily use they do eventually get a big airbubble in them, so he needs to replace them, but he likes this particular mat so I was glad we found it here. We were unable to find it in the store because camping season was over."
positive,"Is it so wrong to break from your kiss to turn up the pop song?: These guys are awesome! Witty lyrics...great riffs...powerful power chords...lots of fun. I laughed out loud at the lyric, ""Is it so wrong to break from your kiss to turn up the pop song?"" from the song 'Pump Up The Volume'. Sort of reminds me of a cross between XTC and Weezer...even a little bit Ian Dury. This is a smart band. I strongly recommend this CD."
positive,Whittaker & Watson: Classic text. Good encyclopedic source of mathematics - pure & applied. Definitely not a picture book and takes a bit of digging to find what one needs. Typical abbreviated index found in British texts of that era.
positive,A GREAT BOOK: THIS BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD TO BE QUITE FRANK IT WAS DISTURBING BUT VERY GOOD I GIVE IT 5 STARS ALL THE WAY IT IS A COMPLEAT MASTERPIECE EVEN IF NOT FOR BED TIME.
negative,"Good investigator, not such a good writer: Keppel is obviously a very intelligent man with vast experience in serial murder investigation, and at the forefront of his field. The book explores some very interesting concepts through the use of many famous investigations. However, Keppel seems to write with a real lack of emotion, which I guess is necessary in his job. Which is why he should stick with that job instead of trying to be a writer. The lack of emotion made it feel like I was reading a calculus textbook. Keppel also seems to repeat himself over and over throughout the different chapters. This only adds to the boredom."
negative,"In Th South of France: This book is a bit of a disappointment. Although it contains some beautiful, artistic pictures, I was looking for a book that would highlight all the specific cities and villages with actual photos--not artsy shots. I wanted a book that would remind me of my trip to Nice, Monaco etc. and this one does not."
positive,What an Interesting Life!: MC has had such a fascinating life. Really enjoyed reading and learning more. Understanding his personal history makes his novels more interesting.
positive,Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!!: Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!! Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!! Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!!
positive,"Great: This group was underrated in the US. They had all the jams. Denise, Doris, and Lorraine were so cute. Great stuff!"
negative,Tabla Book: I was not happy with product and returned the book. My edition was poorly printed and pages were out of order.It covered the basics and then quickly became very complicated. Music books can help a student but best used if one has an instructor.The intricacies of playing the tabla cannot be understood just with a book. I would suggest a book with a CD or DVD.David Courtney's other basic book is much better for the beginner.
negative,"chemical can cause a reaction: We usually put our baby in cloth diapers, but we do keep a stash of disposables on hand for trips and emergencies. I really wish pampers would go back to offering their usual 'cruiser' style diapers without the baby-dry. Our child has had a bad reaction to them-- she gets diaper rash almost immediately."
positive,"Don't Miss This One!!!: I have been a Great White fan since their self titled first album...in fact, I went to see Judas Priest back in '84 only because Great White was the opening act.I still love listening to the old stuff, but this one is by far my favorite. It is definitely more mature and mellow by comparison...but I keep listening to this one over and over! ""Rolling Stoned"" is good, classic rock'n'roll, and the ballads are fabulous!The boys get some help from a couple of my other favorite rockers...Jack Blades (Night Ranger, Damn Yankees, Shaw/Blades) helped to write quite a few songs. You can really hear his influence on ""In the Tradition""...which has to be the best song on the album. Don Dokken (Dokken) helped out on ""Wooden Jesus"".So, whether you are a ""old"" die-hard fan, or a new one, don't miss this one!"
positive,"Awesome: Like many other reviewers said, please ignore the bad reviews and read this awesome book for yourself. This book was recommended to me by a person that didnt like reading as much as I did and I was grabbed by the book and read late into the night, every night, until I was finished. I enjoyed the storyline and how it made me want to read the next book. I know that the book was written from many other books but think of how creative Christopher Paolini was to be able to take other stories, meld them together, and make a very exciting book out of them. I recommend this book to anyone."
negative,"Typical action film with strange attempt at humor: This is a typical action film with lots of fight scenes and gun fights but little logic. It's amazing that hundreds of bullets can be fired at point blank range with no one getting hit and people getting hit in the face with fire extinguishers, pieces of wood and other objects without so much as a scratch. And then there are people surviving incredible explosions, again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably. They were not only not funny but were very wierd to me.I enjoy watching John Cena in action, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was fun to watch, but this movie just didn't impress me anymore than wrestling does. I think one star out of five was being too generous."
positive,"A LOT better than R.C. Welch's ""Scary Stories For Stormy Nights""!: A LOT better than R.C. Welch's ""Scary Stories For Stormy Nights""! Unlike that book, these stories are original (and not sad).My favorite story is ""The Hook"", because I enjoy scary stories about serial killers, and this one, like ""High Beams"", can happen, which makes it HORRIFYING!"
negative,horrible cd: i was wanting to buy this cd but im glad i diddnt i burned it from my cousins. After hearing toxicity and chop suey the rest of the songs are horrible. i think that all the procides for this cd is going to terrorsim. WARNING: DONT BUY THIS CD
positive,"What a pleasant surprise!: Made in CAN in 2000, Serial# SK-89237, Playing Time: 55 min.Don't let the fact that this CD (his 18th) is on the Sony Classical label: there's no classical music here!I never know what to expect from a new Joe Jackson album: he's done some I really like (like ""I'm The Man"" and ""Night And Day""), and some I really hate (like ""Jumpin' Jive"" and ""Heaven & Hell"").The performances of the trio (piano, bass and drums) in this case is astonishingly fresh and impeccably recorded; there are some smart arrangements (like ""Fools In Love/For Your Love"") and the renditions of other people's music are respectful yet innovative.This CD won't be collecting dust!"
positive,"Extended what?: This is advertised as an ""extended edition"", but your technical information does not mention the length of this ""extended"" edition as other listings do. Is it an extended edition because it's loaded with extras, like commentaries etc? Or are there deleted scenes included in the movie itself. If you're going to advertise an ""Extended"" edition you should at least explain what the extensions are! I want to buy this movie but not until I see further explanation. I'm sure many of your other customers feel the same way. Your marketing people should be more on the ball. You're losing a lot of sales due to their lack of expertise."
positive,Reliving History: I remember watching this movie when I was a little girl and fell in love with musicals. It was one of the best Cinderella stories ever. I have always wanted to purchase the movie but could never find it anywhere. I am happy to see that it is finally available on DVD. Any little girl can watch and dream about being Cinderella.
negative,"Interesting Ideas, Poor Presentation: While the ideas that lay the framework for this book are solid, everything else is lacking.The humor is forced, awkward, and on occasion plagarized. A nearly verbatim quote from a Monty Python sketch stands out in my mind.The plot is slow and seldom rivetting. The only thing that kept me turning the pages at some points was my search for the origin of the ""REMIND ME AGAIN HOW THE HORSE-SHAPED ONES MOVE"" quote.The character development is poor. The main character, Brutha, makes a sudden transition from a bumbling idiot to a sagely leader-of-men and bargainer-with-gods. I wasn't convinced.The ideas, however, are the salvation of this book. Read it if you have a good imagination...you'll need it to make up a new story around the concept Pratchett so poorly utilizes."
positive,"Dan's Review: A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a good book. It taught me a lot about my faith that I didn't know. It also got into more detail about the things I already knew. This book is about a boy from Philadelphia named Michael O'Shea. After the death of his father, Michael and his family go to live with his Uncle Les, his mom's brother, in Kentucky for the summer. Down in Kentucky Michael is forced to defend his religion against his Uncle Les and church elders such as, Luther, George, and Jimmy. I enjoyed this book, but the only thing I disliked about it was that it was hard to get in to. The beginning was boring and wordy to me, but I finally got into the book during the Bible Studies. They were very interesting and knowledge filled. This was a very good book and a fast read, I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars."
negative,"Hopelessly pretentious and muddled filmisation of the famous 1946 novel: ""All the King's Men"" is a pointless filmisation of Robert Penn Warren's 1946 novel, which had already been brought to the screen to great effect by Robert Rossen in 1949 - THAT version garnered a Best Picture Oscar.The story of a Louisiana Governor (played by Sean Penn) who will stop at nothing to maintain power is pretty tame by today's standards.The script and direction by writer/director Steven Zaillian are hopelessly muddled and pretentious - even the big, emotional moments fizzle. Overlong and overwrought - an excellent cast is wasted."
positive,"Grant and Hepburn's Best Pairing!!: Although probably the least well known, Holiday is Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn's best movie collaboration. The script has that unmistakable Broadway freshness and Hollywood-free feel about it. Like The Philadelphia Story, Holiday's supporting characters were incredibly inviting and zany! But I found Grant and Hepburn's characters much more appealing and human than ""Philadelphia""! This is one of the best transfers from stage to screen that I have ever seen a story and script make! A must-see for any Grant or Hepburn fan!!"
negative,"Incompatible with Kindle: Make sure you view the sample first. Most of the characters particular to Spanish and linquistics show up as gibberish and on most pages the formatting seems to be lost. It is obvious that no one at the publisher even glanced at this to see if it worked when it was converted. Amazon can share responsibility. At the time of this review Kindle developers are still exclusively Anglo-centric. I hope they eventually see the value in adding some foreign language support (yes, Amazon, there are some people that read Spanish in the United States...)."
negative,"didn't live up to expectations: I was quite disappointed in this movie. The trailers, as is often the case, showed the majority of high points in the movie. It had its moments, but it dragged on, and the male lead had no energy at all and brought nothing to the film. I was also surprised Jennifer Aniston would lend herself to such a simplistic, afterthought kind of character. Surely she could get more important parts than this."
negative,"Terrible!: We went from Swaddlers Sensitive to Baby Dry and were so disappointed after less than a week that we gave them away and went back to the Swaddlers. First of all not only did they leak urine (EVERY night woke up soaked) but even during the day when I changed my four month old's diaper after only a couple of hours his skin was very damp. Now he's never had a diaper rash, and all Ive ever used to keep him dry were the swaddler and baby powder but with these diapers I started using desitin just to keep the urine off his skin. They also couldnt hold in his poops. EVERY time he pooped (not exaggerating) it was a complete blow out, down his legs, up the back of his clothes. We NEVER had this problem with the Swaddlers. I also have to agree with the post about them being too thin, feeling recycled and rough against babys skin. The Swaddlers are MUCH better."
negative,"READ CAREFULLY!!!!: They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color. Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top. I was so upset. Deceiving and conniving company. Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back. I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought ""hey, it only happened to one person"" Well, it happened to me too. Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box, so I don't know how good/bad the quality is yet. The sizing is right, I am a woman's 8, to that is a men's 6.It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected, but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops. The picture was of high top shoes."
negative,"On behalf of Britain I am deeply sorry.: This is an obscenely derivative album which basically amounts to some not very talented people revamping Mrs Gallagher's record collection and passing it off as their own. If only they'd been American, maybe someone would have called the lawyers and done away with this formulaic, monotone drivel.I would suggest you go back to the search box and look up the original artists instead - T Rex, The New Seekers and,of course, The Beatles. Also recommended is R.E.M.s 'The Wake-Up Bomb' which derides them nicely."
positive,"Received one glass broken: The martini set is very nice and the price was certainly reasonable but one of the glasses was broken when it was received. I called and asked to have one glass sent to me but they told me I would have to return the whole set. Since it was so inexpensive, it was not worth it to me to go to the trouble to send it back so I only have three glasses!!! I thought it would be much simpler for them to send me one glass!"
negative,"sized incorect: always wear 9 1/2 Med, these shoes were almost two sizes larger, I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately."
positive,"Great Coffee and Equipment Guide: I learned a lot from this book about coffee, and it was a very valuable source of information when I recently purchased a new espresso machine."
positive,"Transformers: This item was suppose to contain a digital copy but it only has a Blu-ray and a DVD disk. The digital disk was not included, from the package and from your advertising it was suppose to be included. What happened?"
positive,"Wonderful CD slightly misleading title: This is one of my favourite Jewish Choral CDs of all time yet I agree with other reviewers that this is not representative of the Jewish choral tradition of the UK. This should have been a double CD set with the first featuring really traditional music and the second exposing us to the new genre of mainly modern Reform choral and organ music.Both Moshe and the choir excel themselves. The master mixing is not good and one can hear obvious retakes and splits in the music which is unfortunate. I've not idea what Oseh Shalom by Nurit Hirsh is doing on the CD!The music of the modern mainly reform composers Lipkin, Josephs, Singer is wonderful. If I had to choose three pieces to take to a desert island, I would take Ma Yedidot by Charles Salaman, Aneh Ani by Verrinder and Psalm 23 by Rideout. Three magnificent works.I believe the company, Olympia, no longer functions so there won't be many more CDs available. If it's still available, grab one!"
positive,"Absolutely awesome and vivid!: This book has to be the best of the ""Cat"" series. The main man in the book, Cat, makes you want to love him, slap him, and then cry for him. Moving and so full of twists and turns it leaves you hanging word for word 'till the very end. A MUST for any sci-fi fan."
positive,"Entertaining horse movie.: This movie is really entertaining and the acting is great. I really like the scene with the two little foals, Beauty and Lucky, playing together. I liked the girl. The scenery in Africa is stunning, too. The horses are beautiful. I got this movie for my sister's 12th birthday. She really enjoyed it too. Some scenes are scary and sad for kids under 7,(like when the stable is set on fire with the horses in it, and when Lucky's mother is killed by Caeser) which is one of the reasons that I gave Running Free four stars insted of five. The names where not very creative, most horses where named things like Lucky or Beauty. Also there is a couple parts where horses do things that a horse would not do,(like when Caeser kills Lucky's mother. A stallion would not in a million years kill a mare.) I like this movie, and it was only $6. Overall, this is a great movie to get if you want an interesting horse movie."
negative,"This item has a desight problem: Length:: 0:10 MinsThis item have a desing problem, cause the plug in get water out all the time..."
positive,"Wonderdul stories: These are wonderful stories. Claudio Munoz is one of our favorite illustrators and Richard Walker is one of our favorite story tellers. With these 2 collaborating, how can you go wrong? My kids, ages 3 and 5 are transfixed by these stories.My one complaint is we never received the CD with this book."
negative,"Yes, just ok: I bought these at Target too. Yes, they are very big and take up a big space in the cupboard. The handles are terrible because there isn't really a handle on them. Yes, the rubber footing keeps them in place- when you can keep the rubber gasket to stay on. But if you want to hang on to the bowl like to mix up a pie crust, I have other bowls with a great big handle that's so much easier to grab and hand on to while working the dough. And if you want to use a hand mixer with 2 beaters in these bowls, forget it, they're too curved at the bottom. My other set of mixing bowls have a flatter bottom so I can use the hand mixer. There's just too much wrong with these bowls to get much use out of them."
positive,THIS CD IS THE BEST!!!!: OMG... if you don't have Clay's CD you MUST get it! All of the songs are so beautiful and it shows off Clay's voice perfectly. My personal favorite is Shine and Measure of a Man. (Also I would recommend that you get his new single with Solitaire :) )
negative,"No Point At All: I wouldn't recommend this book if you like to read things that make sense. Certainly, this book had any point to it whatsoever. The fact that a man would kill his supposed 'friend' just because people are after him is absolutely horrible. There was absolutely no plot to this story and you knew exactly what was going to happen next. This book was a waste of time and a waste of money."
positive,She is the best and we the people are definately feeling you: Lauren touched a lot of everyday issues and i just want to let her know taht she did a great job letting the people know what Lauryn stands for alone. And I aslo give it to her for being yrs. old and having it together.
negative,"WHICH JOKE DID YOU FIND FUNNY?: Adam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian, George Simmons, who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug. He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wanna-be Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) attempting stand-up. Sadler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal go-fer. Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it. George plays the death card to patch up relationships, then suddenly he isn't going to die anymore. George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame. The language was crude and sexual. Brief nudity. Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit-coms look really lame. If you think a guy saying ""tweet"" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you."
positive,"Simply the Best!: This is the ""go to"" book for females that are too nice! Lots of tips on standing your ground, not being a pushover, or a doormat. I like how inside the book there are confessions from men she interviewed and I found what they had to say honest and intriguing. A must buy you won't regret it!"
positive,"Oasis: oasis is a very talented British rock band reminds me of the early days of the British invasion of the sixties somewhat like a mix of the Beatles and the Rolling stones.Be here now by oasis,is a overall good album so if you,re into British rock? I recommend it and give it 4 stars."
negative,"My thouts of the book ""Fahrenheit 451"": I thought there was no point to this book what so ever and i dont suggest anyone to read it...! i had to read it for school and i didnt even finish it because it was so bad!"
negative,"baby what?: they did not let me leave comment on pampers size 5 not the baby dry but cruiser i just bought size five and there is NO MESH LINER! I contacted pampers and this is their response:I'm sorry for the confusion. Sometimes we try new features on our diapers which result in different versions being on store shelves at the same time. I understand your frustration since you're not able to tell which package has the style you prefer, and I'm sharing your feedback with the rest of our team.hmmm....how about I want my MONEY BACK?"
positive,"Touching read, with much relevance to modern times.: This was a special read for me as I grew up watching June Allyson play Jo March in the 2nd movie remake. It was interesting to read all the similarities between the book and all movie versions, but I also enjoyed the stories that were not included in any of the movies. Interestingly, I enjoyed many of the lessons regarding growing up and marriage that I feel still ring true in our current times."
positive,"Thank you Clayton: Finally a CD that I love ""ALL"" the tracks. I hope this is the first of many to add to my collection. Awesome, beautifully done! There is now hope that music will be music once again!!!"
positive,"THE CREAM OF THE CROP!!!!!!!!!!: The finest pop songwriters get a piece of their due with this three disc set. There were no finer writers than HDH during the second half of the twentieth century and this set is testimony to that. Sadly, most of these songs are available elsewhere and avid Motown fans will find this redundant. Great mono versions of a good chunk of their biggest hits but a second volume is called for with more of the post Motown output and a deeper look into the vaults for demos of some of the literally hundreds of top shelf songs these guys wrote. How did they do it? Don't have a clue but I sure do love these songs..."
positive,"Mature ladies! Score this wonderful stuff!!: For a comparatively little price, you can give yourself a bit of that youth ""glow"" that used to come naturally. Use a tiny dab of Revlon Skinlights Instant Skin Brightener wherever you want that shimmer to accent your features. Voila!The effect of Revlon Skinlights Instant Skin Brightener can be subtle enough to use in bright sunlight, but with a little extra application, can create a more dramatic look. If you've been after that subtle ""glitter"" look that you've seen in fashion magazines, Revelon has most definitely got the goods!"
negative,"Another half-baked gay themed film: Three young Germans are hanging out in Brazil. They are a useless and aimless bunch, filling their days making lame pornos for the internet and celebrating moronic rap. (For me, that's enough to give any movie a zero rating.) The part of the story (the non-rap part) involving a love affair between one of the lads and a local is fitfully interesting. Beyond that, save your money."
positive,"Brilliance: Larry Clark, you are a f#$@!$g legend!!! I watched this movie and thought i had just seen the real 24 hours of a teenager who is faced with many dificulties and is placed in many hard situations. This movie is not exploitation, it is meerly displaying youth culture as is. PERIOD!!! Read no more reviews, waste no more time, just click those buttons and order this fantastic movie - you won't regret it!!!"
negative,"Waste of time, soft core trash!: I Spit on Your Grave, more like I spit on this movie. How anyone can like this movie is beyond me. I personally like violent movies, but movies of class and style, such as (Goodfellas, Halloween, and The Exorcist), but I Spit on Your Grave has neither, just a woman getting raped in the first half, and her revenge in the second half. Mabey the reason critics hate this film(HA-HA) so much is because it really does suck. Their really is no bacic story, and acting that deserves turkey awards for the entire cast. Come on people quit wasting your time on a movie that no one can even say (this is a horror movie, a suspence movie, or a drama) because honestly I don't even know myself. But I do know that this garbage should be banned from the public peroid..."
positive,"The beauty of cats: The author provides an introduction on the history of the domestic cat, and then proceeds to discuss the different breeds in the chapters: Persian or Longhaired; Other Longhaired; Unusual & Semi-longhaired; Shorthaired; Foreign Breeds; Oriental and Siamese; and Pet Cats. All the major pedigree breeds are identified and described with a short history of the breed, to help the prospective owner to decide which variety to choose, as well as the most important points to look out for. The magnificent color photographs capture the full spectrum of the beauty of cats, from the cuteness of the playful kitten to the splendor of champion show winners. It is a delightful read and a valuable reference source to the different breeds of cats. Highly recommended to all people owned by cats."
negative,Poor Job: I got all four Discovery HD DVD's. Brazil and China work fine on my ToshibaA-2. Italy and Australia do not. I returned them to Amazon and the replacements did not work either. Then I started reading and found many otherpeople with the same problem which is caused by a coding problem with thesetwo disc's. These two will go back tomorrow. It's a shame Discovery did sucha poor job making sure these disc's were playable especially considering howfew different models of HD DVD Players there are out on the market.
positive,"International Organizations In Their Legal Settings (Kirgis): The work covers many pertinent areas; such as, international legal capacity, international organizations, dispute settlementmechanisms, the formation of European communities, the charterof the United Nations and a fair amount of relevant case studies.The book is scholarly. It is for serious students of world government, the structure of governmental organizations,international law, international protocols and the legaldimensions of world trade."
negative,ARGGGGGG!!!!!!!: This is generic half less than ok - half horrible - completely unforgetable - generic drudge - please get back with Survivor and make something someone in America would like? or are you happy playing to tiny crowds in Europe - comeon....lets get back together for some good music - not this sore missing any punch run of the mill yuk - Survivor could have rocked the sh.. out of the Real One - which is now being endless played on radio...
negative,"Only for a novice: I read Godel's original paper over my winter break (2001) from my second year of medical school at UCSF. It is a fun paper to try to grasp, but unless you are extremely mathematically gifted (like me) or have spent years plodding away studying philosophy or math, then stay away from the original paper. If you are a casual reader and want to read great and important philosophy then stick with Heidigger and Kierkegard and such. Being and Time is a lot more fun if you just want some easy reading. Godel is hard stuff and only accessible to a select few. I loved it.However, if you are new to logic, mathematics or philosophy then you can try to read Nagel's book. I found it too simplistic and way too remedial. If that is your style then buy Nagel. However, if you are more sophisticated like me, then go read the original work. You will be much better off for it."
positive,"The Kindle version is great!: The earliest two 1-star reviews were for the print version. However, all the Old Norse characters show up wonderfully in the Kindle version. I say 'Old Norse' because the text deals with Old Norse / Icelandic and not the modern Icelandic language. Here, the acute vowel accents (á é í ó ú) are passed over in favor of macron vowel accents, just as they are in the author's ""Anglo-Saxon Primer With Grammar, Notes, and Glossary; Eighth Edition Revised"", which is also free for the Kindle!As a bonus for those into Norse mythology there are some stories about the sir, Vanir, and Jötnar in the original Old Norse, and the sections therein which have explanatory notes are underlined and clickable. Another free resource and excellent companion to this Kindle book is the ""Norse Course - Old Norse for Beginners"" website.Kaup essa 'free' Kindle-bók!"
positive,"Great scenery.: Well, there really were livestock thieves back then, and they really were hanged or shot for their trouble. They really did consider rustling to be a viable career choice.I thought the mood of the enterprise that Nicholson's character and friends carried on was about right. Brando seemed to overdo it, but ""regulators"" or hired guns weren't exactly the junior exec type either.This is not a western or cowboy movie that small kids should watch. There are hangings and public displays of corpses in it."
negative,"Little disappointing: Maybe because it was written for his children, and although it provides good summarized historic events, I found the author to be too opinionated on such matters that should be historically evidenced..."
negative,"You Can Do Better......: What a difference a year makes in digital photography! Or 5 years come to that. Having bought the book, 50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques, it was immediately clear that the techniques and tips were aimed at beginning photoshop workers. Nothing wrong with that. However, by today's standards, there are many more attractive books on the market that do the same thing so much better and with much better quality illustrations and colour photgraphs. I found the tips a bit 'old hat' and the illustrations very old hat, the sort of tips and techniques you could easily pick up in an hour's search on the net, AND with better colour examples.Still, to keep things in perspective, the book IS 5 years old and it shows.Buy it if you want a cheap second-hand book for your shelf. Otherwise, you can do much, much better with the scores of other visually attractive beginner/intermediate books on today's market."
positive,"good product: I kept hearing stories of people's teeth becoming really sensitive from these strips. Asked my dentist friend and he told me that is likely due to getting the material (peroxide) on the gums. Also told me that the results are directly proportional to how long you leave the strips on. With this info, I used the strips with good results and no discomfort.If you're wondering what it feels like to use these, it's very similar to getting an x-ray or mold at the dentist. Something in your mouth, which shouldn't be there, but you'll be able to work around it with a little practice. Not uncomfortable, just a bit odd, at least at first."
negative,"STILL only sending 1 instead of 6 pack, 2 year problem: I realize that this ""should"" be a review about the quality of the product, BUT for almost 2 YEARS people have been commenting that they received one canvas instead of a pack of six. Sorry, but that is simply unacceptable. I'm very disappointed in Amazon for letting it go on this long. I'm sorry that the manufacturer won't have people purchasing their item, but there is no excuse for a problem to continue for nearly 2 years and not be resolved."
positive,"Stop the Whining! This Album Rules: Just shut your traps for a moment. It's a bit poppy, sort of indie rock, and still a throwback to the spaced out technical metal that made ""Dimension Hatross"" a transcendently unreal album. They incorporate more muffled strumming bass/guitar impacts in the style of mainstream bands like Pantera, but these musicians are serious about reforming after loss of a member and making competitive, current music. Still listenable to this day, ""Negatron"" is both emotional and coldly logical, violently lowbrow and mentally mutilatingly highbrow. Enjoy it if you have the headspace."
positive,S/S C/Z Eternity Ring: This ring is slim & fancy at the same time! It is a very precious ring to own & i am proud to say I have one. It was a great deal for the $! I love it!
negative,Movie Quit in middle and wouldn't reload.: Watched movie till halfway point and then just quit playing. Tried several times with no success and even moved to a different machine. Only paid $ 5 so I should have suspected something. Not worth the effort to mail back to seller.
positive,"Best Book for NEW breastfeeding Mothers.: If you are planning to breastfeed ( which I personally highly advise you to ) then get this book and read it as soon as possiable, preferably before you have your baby and then again after. It helped me so much and I am so glad for all the advice and encouragment this book gave me. Breasfeeding my new baby is the most wonderful expierence! True, it takes a little time and patience to get it but when you do- it is so worth it!!! This book and a good lactation consultant can make it work for you! Good Luck."
positive,Incredible Christmas gift: This book makes a great Christmas gift with a beautiful message and view of all those involved in the birth of our Savior.
positive,"Good price and delivery: Being a standard product, the quality is not in question. It was a good price shipped in a reasonable amount of time (less than 2 weeks)"
positive,"Poems: I thought the book was going to be bigger than it was, its pretty thin. It comes exactly as described though."
negative,"Cmon ""honors"" people!: the movie was pretty bad, but i would think that honors kids would be original enough to write their own reviews. alice's was good, those were her words, but kayla, jana...we were all there when noteboom said what you wrote and you're taking credit for it? please!"
positive,"Open minded german ""metal""?: With Heiland, Schweissers fourth album, the band takes a big step outside their metal-hardcore image. Most of the tracks show a wider range of styles, taking the very intense lyrics to an even higher level. All of the songs have a very good live feeling, always with an eye on the right groove (and who wants to bang his head to the same rhytm for a two hour show?) Knowing their new work ""..bitte warten"" (please wait) this was the needed link in between. Highlights are: Heiland, Meine Liebe ist ein Monster (featuring Apocalyptica), Friss Scheisse and Nachrechnen."
positive,"~Judge for yourself~: I was so afraid of getting this DVD after reading the bad reviews some gave this movie. I decided to give it a shot as I adored the 1st & 2nd Dundee movies. I was not disappointed & felt is wasn't a waste of money as some have stated.Maybe the bad reviews are because it ISN'T full of filthy language, violence, sexual situations & nudity that some think is needed to make a ""good movie"". I personally enjoy watching something that all my family can enjoy & laugh to. Sure some things in the movie are a little ""corky"" but that's what makes Crocodile Dundee so endearing!It was great seeing the whole gang back together again & am so happy that I didnt listen to the few bad reviews & judged for myself!"
negative,Stopped working after 3 days!: Unsure how a cable can stop working after 3 days but this one did. Wasted a bunch of my time figuring out what went wrong only to find it was the new cable. Total junk.
negative,Dune-once more into the breach: I read the thing back in 1972 and thought it overblown. But I was just a kid. Will the ensuing 28 years improve it? If not I'll read a Robert Heinlein novel to get back on track.
positive,"This toy is still a hit one year later: My daughter (now 21 months) got this toy for Christmas last year, and it has been a toy she's played with nearly every day. We leave it inside for her so on rainy days she can ride it inside. She used it as a walker while learning to walk - my only complaint with it as a walker is that it can sometimes get away from the child as it starts rolling too fast. However, she still loves riding on it - and still gets a big grin when she presses the nose and hears the music. Overall I would recommend this toy."
negative,Lousy: This movie became so boring I stopped watching it after an hour and a half. I liked the first one much better.
negative,"Unfortunately, it's one of King's worst: It's too long, much too long, for the story. The characters are thinly drawn, the portrayal of Duddits is hopelessly sentimental, Kurtz is a stereotype and a cliche, the biology of the aliens makes little sense, nor does the connection between the four friends and Duddits (we never quite know just what Duddits has been doing, if anything) and it all has a hangdog, been-there-done-that feel. ..."
negative,"Waste your money on something else more worthwhile: Yes, I am a big fan of Soundgarden. I was mad that they broke up. I was happy to find out chris cornell was coming out with a solo cd. This cd has only one good song on it, can't change me, but that;s just my opinion. I just got it today, and i wish i spent my money on something better. Oh well, maybe i'll learn to like it. I just want to say, i was horribly disappointed, and i'm happy for all you people who love this new cd, it's just that......i don't."
positive,"It doesn't get any better than this: The introduction to the best story ever written, Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit stands alone in its own right, however, as one of the best fantasy novels, if not one of the best books of all time. You will not be disappointed."
negative,"The $20 stop watch: Before you buy this thing, understand one thing. When you mark a song, you have to remember the station you were listening to at that time. So if you have 10 emarks, you have to remember the station you were listening to at the time of each of the emarks. I wondered about this detail before I bought the thing and found no mention of it anywhere on their website. I assumed it would mark the station somehow. My mistake. Learn from it."
positive,From Jonathans daugter ally: Hello...My name is ally crane and i am Jonathan crane daughter!This book is a great book if you want to know about social programs that work and things like that!It is very well written and gives the reader a lot of info. So if you want a book about it then DO get this book! P.S. it is dedicated to me...lol!My real name is alyssa!
positive,"I like movies: As someone who likes all kinds of movies, I thought that this selection would be a worthwhile watch. It was great."
positive,"Add it to your collecton: After hearing and seeing the video for ""Zoot Suit Riot"", I wanted to hear the whole album. I was skeptical at first when I bought it, but I'm glad I did, it kicks! The music is good for listening at parties or just around the house. Add it to your collection, you wont be disappointed."
negative,"Vast oversimplification: Feldman attempts to ""solve"" church/state tensions by dividing the country into two camps -- secularists and evangelicals. This starting premise dooms the book. He has bought into the evangelicals' rhetoric, rather than any actual array of beliefs on these issues. Those in opposition to the evangelicals are not anti-religion, as the term ""secularist"" implies, but rather in the vast majority of circumstances are themselves religious. The debate over relgion in the U.S. cannot be reduced to this simple dichotomy. This is an ivory tower worldview, untouched by empirical reality."
negative,did not work: The computer that was given to me did not work from the beginning. It did not receive power. I sent it into the company and it has now been a month since I first sent it off. I am not pleased that I was not able to receive a replacement especially when I need a computer because I am in college.
negative,"lord of the flies: Golding wrote his worse book yet, when it comes to lord of the flies. He tries to show the evil in mankind, but saince it is a group of (5-12) year olds it is totally unbelievable. The kids start off all gitty and gay but then turn on each other in a short period of time. The have a democracy at first but then they lose all rules and start killing each other. Ya how real is that? People this is a group of 5-12 year olds and they are roaming around hunting pigs and killing humans. The meetings start off when Ralph calls a meeting with a conch he found. The group declares Ralph as the leader. Piggy represents rules and guidelines. Roger is supposed to show a misguided soul he proably was picked on when he was at his school"
positive,"ALL OF HIS ALBUMS ARE HUGE CLASSICS, R.KELLY IS AWESOME .: First All of the R.Kelly`s Albums are Phenomenal Classics... Every album he made is very entertaint one. As for this one, from the release date almost 3 years ago The TP-2.COM Classic Album still makes me chills and feels butterflies in my heart and soul. Every I mean every single song is very heart felt song for him and he brings all his effort to it.I love the whole album, I don`t have to skip a song here it is all greatness art sensual music on it. As some other fan may said here, ""R.Kelly is still ahead of the package"". Because no one can beat him and his music. I rate this album 5 Stars because they can`t put another high number for rate. For me 100 Stars maybe can make a decent rate for this Masterpice. I Recomend this album for everyone who loves hot slow jams, Mid-tempo ballads, A Pair of Up-Tempo Ballads, Pair of Gospel Sound Beautiful Songs and even a touch and flavor between Latin and Hip-Hop Style. I LOVE IT..."
negative,"Disappointed: I love the box, and even the pictures on the box that the dragon is supposed to look like, you know like ""see-through"" clear blue plastic. Unfortunately, it looks like its made from some sort of tubberware material.The electronic sounds (2 and not in any sequence),one sounds okay/good, the other sounds like the flushing sound on my daughters potty book. The eyes look like round paper decals and looks...wierd. I'm sure my 6 yr old son would like it, just because its YU-GI-OH, but I'm a fan too and was excited about getting this for him for XMAS......I'm glad I started early, I can return it for something else."
negative,"pleeeezz charleeeezz: One has to wonder how a film so bad can be made with so many fine things about it. I see from other reviews that the really horrible actor Stewart Townsend is Charlize Theron's boyfriend. She won an Academy Award so she got to demand his inclusion probably. He cannot act and he utterly cannot imagine what it would be like to be the man he plays in this movie. He has sex with the Charleezz character often. That he knows how to do. And Charlize probably ignored direction because her acting is utterly unaffecting. The beautiful wonderful Penelope Cruz is underused. No gorgeous closeups of her gorgeous face and she dies early. Is this the fault a dumb director/writer, John Dagan? The cinamentography is lovely. The costumes are fine. The story is ok as well. Its just shown in a way that is as boring as it can be and we probably have Charlizzzzz to thank for that for dragging in her idiot boyfriend and rejecting direction. Come to think of it, I havent seen much by her lately."
positive,school resource: I love that I can get these older writings free for the Kindle. It makes a huge difference in our homeschooling budget.
negative,Overhyped?: Product reviews are very subjective. Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price. Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort. They shoes were stiff and far too 'roomy'. My feet where floating inside them. I returned them immediately. I've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box.
negative,Interesting if you like reading about research progress: I am a high school student in grade 12. I read this book as a ISU novel study. I didn't really get into the book until the part about the mice. Otherwise it was pretty boring. But if you like that kind of stuff go ahead and get the book.I recommend this book to anyone over 40 with a lot of time on their hands.
positive,Enjoyed it: I enjoyed this dvd it was amazing to watch I would recommand this dvd to any and all WWE fans.
negative,"see Iron Monkey instead!: Plenty of people have complained about the storyline and acting. I have to agree. I've read Dumas' book, it's great, and this is not even close. Enough said.Others have praised the fighting, but really, you can see better fighting in better movies. The fights range from no-skills brawling (for example, knocking out two men with two punches to the face, or beating down two swordsmen with a tree branch) to Hong Kong-style acrobatics. But then, it wasn't even close to the acrobatics you can find in Iron Monkey (from 1993, directed by Yuen Woo-ping) in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or in Jet Li's Fist of Legend. Those kinds of stunts fit nicely in the Asian culture but look strange in 17th century France.Are we really supposed to believe that overweight slob taught D'Artagnan how to fight like that? And in the end, Tim Roth might have won the fight if he'd spent more time fencing and less time jumping around on ladders like a circus clown. See Iron Monkey instead!"
negative,"LCD had problems displaying after 10 months.: this clock looks pretty cool but the quality needs to be improved. it's absolutely not worth of $$.i bought one with an AC adapter last year which cost me $$ more. i like the LCD to constantly show the time at night so i didn't care the extra $$.it took a long time to receive the radio signal from Coloroda. but it was pretty easy setting the calendar, date, day, time and alarm. i was very happy about it until this February. the LCD suddenly went partially blank. i wouldn't even guess what time it was showing. i thought the batteries ran out so i replaced with a new pair. yet it still couldn't display the time properly and the LCD turned totally blank in a day."
negative,"very dark period piece........: The Girl, based on a Catherine Cookson novel, is a period drama set in Victorian times. While the sets, costumes are actors are all exceptional, the story itself is one of the darkest and disturbing ones I've seen.While in all probability more realistic to the times, Cooksons portrayal of a young girl, born on the ""wrong"" side of the bed, and her eventual life with her illegitimate father, and terribly sadistic stepmother is very hard to watch. Be forewarned-this is not a ""family"" film, as brutal beatings of children, forced sex, adultery, attempted murder, someones hand almost cut off in a ""man trap"", and many more throughly unpleasant scenes make up this mini series.In the end, I found no characters worth any empathy, in fact the ""heroine"" herself becomes so sneaky and underhanded that I for one wished she would NOT end up with the hero at the end.A depressing way to kill several hours and one I would not recommend.1.5 stars for the sets and costuming."
positive,"A Childhood Treasure: it is written in the apocryphal new testament, within the pages of the Apocalypse of Baruch...""around the sun flies a phoenix, the phoenix excretes a worm and the worm excretes cinamon. this is eaten by the kings and princes of the earth.""thats all ive got to say... this man (Frank Herbert) was certainly well read.love, Snow-Flake. xxx*******ps. since writing this article it has come to my attention that the 'apocalypse' of Baruch has been removed from professor eliotts current edition of the new testament aprocrypha... so if you want to read the words i quote above for yourself you will need to aquire a first edition hard back. very expensive im afraid. tc.*******"
negative,"Damnation by Disjointure: I enjoyed the storyline and charactor development. It should have been a 'good read' but was, for me, spoilt by cumbersome presentation and 'arty' expression. I was looking for a story which the theme promised but it got lost in the litteray world. Why can't these writers present ideas and thoughts simply? Complexity does not equate with 'quality'. I also deplore the trend of many a horror novel nowadays having to have a statutary gay component. What's wrong with a bit of plain old spine chilling with a touch of straight on the side?When I finished this story I was not desperately looking for another by the same author! Compare this to ""The Stake' or ""Crota' which where fun reads."
negative,Buy some other album from those nice people at amazon: With no harmful intentions toward the movie brassed off.(thats where the talk at the begining of the song tubthumpin came from)Thank God I don't have any guns. Otherwise I wouldn't be here to write this review. What is this bait and switch. I first heard tubthumping on the radio very most excellent. Or so I thought. I bought the CD hoping for some good British tunes and what did i get. Stuff the baby on the cover could have written better. Please save shelve space never make another CD in this genre.
positive,"A Classic for the Ages: The Fisher King could possibly be Gilliam's BEST film, next to Brazil. The story is a familiar Gilliam theme - treading the fine line between reality and fantasy. What makes this film great is the believability and soul of the story. Gilliam pulls it off brilliantly thanks to a great script and a GREAT cast.Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges along with Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer gave outstanding performances. Williams is great as always and Bridges is at the top of his craft.Heartwarming, surprising, and unique - if you haven't watched this - get it now. If you have, you'll enjoy watching this story of love again and again."
positive,"A Great Read...Thank you!: Grateful I stumbled upon this book. A fantastic read. Timeless and incredibly thought provoking.If the summary grabs you at all, give it a chance."
negative,"Didn't finish: My bookclub picked this book as every once in a while we do a classic and many in my club had fond memories of this book. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it. I got about half through and was never engaged in it. I found myself skimming much of it and finally decided that I'd move on to something else. I think if you enjoy lots of detailed description, this might be a good book for you. It moved too slowly for me, though."
negative,"Almost.........lost it in the end: Held my attention for an airplane ride (hence 2 stars), but I was sincerely disappointed for the last third. Kept reading because I didn't think any author would be that brazen. Trivializes current political / social / religous arguments to an insulting degree."
negative,"""It's the performance, stupid !"": Just my opinion,I'm also a huge fan of the ABB. The music is great, what there is of it. But whoever produced the DVD cut out, and interrupted the music. That's pretty much ""blasphemy"" in my opinion. I got this DVD to see and hear the band play music. To try to get a feel for the live performance.IMO, the folks who chose the format did a disservice to the ABB. I don't have the VHS, but it sounds to me from the other reviewers that it is the way to go."
positive,Amazing update on a classic: This is a great update on a classic. This really helps with the writing style and the added pictures are a bonus!
negative,"Horrible!: This was the absolute worst version of Joseph that I have ever seen. And what makes it bad --- the awful performace by Maria Friedman as the Narrator. Anyone who knows Joseph knows that the Narrator must belt, but Friedman simply cannot belt and it brings down the overall production of the show."
negative,"A Good Surprise and a Let Down!: I had seen the Batman video years ago on youtube where he battled the Joker, Predator, and Aliens. That led me to this movie Hunter/Prey, since the leading actor had played Batman in that video years ago. I read some of the reviews and thought, ""What the heck!"" Unfortunately, this movie was a waste. It had tones of the old Dennis Quaid movie Enemy Mine, but sadly it didn't have the heart that movie did. The plot was silly and the acting was terrible. It's one of those movies where it's not bad enough to turn off, but when you do finish watching it, you'll wish you hadn't wasted the time. There was potential, but I would guess the writing is to blame in this circumstance. As far as Sleep Dealer, it wasn't anything to write home to mom about, but out of the two it was definitely the better movie. I actually found parts of it interesting and even thought the ending was somewhat silly, I felt better about the experience on this one."
negative,"Some sense in the plot please?: Terrible storyline seems to wander aimlessly from page to page. While reading Eragon, many a time I would find myself getting extremely irritated with Paolini and would have to remain calm by reminding myself that this is the work of a pre-pubescent teen. This is definitely noticeable within the cracks in his plot."
negative,"Bottom of the List: I have to agree with the veiwer who said ""A Sickening Picture - Bottom of the List! You would enjoy chewing on aluminum foil more than this piece of trash. This movie made me sick, especially the scene that glorifies rape. I see no excuse for this movie to have been made except to shock and offend which it does to the max! Do yourself a favor, and instead of watching this, shave your head with a cheese-grater. You will enjoy it more"" I don't think I need to add anything to his/her great review."
negative,Not useful for the IBM RUP Certification Exam any more: I used this book to pass the IBM RUP Certification V2003 exam and it was OK (3 stars) for then.I'm giving it 1 star now to warn would-be buyers that it is no longer useful for the latest IBM RUP Certification exam in 2009/2010 IBM have revised the RUP process considerably so lots of processes and terms are different now.
negative,"Problems: I have been very unhappy with this product because it:1) makes a high pitched buzz2) intermittently stops providing enough power causing my computer to constantly switch back and forth between battery and wall power.3) the cord is difficult to wrapI'll be trying to return it through the warranty process, but I wish I had just coughed up the [lots of] extra money to buy an Apple one."
negative,"Bulky, feels gross, not worth ordering: I read up on belly-wrapping after my c-section and bought a couple compression tank-tops from Wal-Mart, which worked nicely. I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews. When I received it and tried it on, it felt disgusting on my skin. It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable (even without a super-tight or thin shirt on), especially when I sat down. The seams and the boning are all very noticeable, and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way, like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty. I have wore corsets for years, and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body. I returned it immediately."
positive,Very happy..: This product gets used allot in my home and its easier to sit and not hurt our backs like the traditional toilet seats do. Thank you...Robert R
positive,"You don't have to be/have a sister to enjoy it.: It was a joy to see how these two sisters took the highs and lows of life, love and loss, birth and death, laughter and tears, and made me feel a part of the event. Shakespeare said brevity is the soul of wit and the authors have captured that advice superbly. There are poems in this book that are so short in lines yet are so deep and touching in the message conveyed, they sparkle with brilliance. You don't have to be a woman, or have a sister, to enjoy the celebration of the authors' lives."
negative,"Basic Romeo and Juliet: I am a high school English teacher looking at the different versions of classics texts available for Kindle (fire), so my review will not be for the play itself, but rather for the eBook--readability, layout, price, and other features.This 99 cent version is very basic. It has the complete text of the play, but that's about it. It does not have any chapter select links to either act or scene, and no line numbers are provided. There are no notations or explanations. The layout does maintain the iambic pentameter poetry, but the text appears crowded on the page as there is no line break or spacing between speakers.At 99 cents, this version is not bad; however, there are better, equally inexpensive versions."
positive,Good read!: Lots of good tips on maintaining control of oneself and not getting carried away too fast after a first date and in the relationship.
positive,"Its a good movie!: I really liked this movie. The previews made it seem a bit sad. It was nice to see Zach be a different character, and everyone else was also excellent. The under pressure scene is awesome."
positive,"The Greatest Animated Film Of Our Time.: MEGATRON MUST BE STOPPED. NO MATTER THE COST! Those are the most powerful words to ever grace the Animated big screen. This is a tale of bravery like you've never seen before. In pure ""George Lucas"" fashion we are sent on an impossible mission in which the fate of our universe lies on the deeds of a small band of heroes. Beating the odds is what life is all about. It's an inspiring movie that will give you chills down your spine. Anyone who has seen this film will certainly agree. To the true fans I'll use the Universal greeting ""Bah weep granna weep ninny bon."" To all the rest. ""Feed them to the Sharkticons."" ""Till All Are One."" DN"
positive,"If they ever cut a record, they're here: This is the most complete history of rock I've ever seen--and I saw quite a few when I was researching for my book ""Forever Retro Blues."" This book has become indespensible as a tool for promoting my book also. I can get a call to be a guest on radio as few as three hours before. It's great to be able to look up an artist or record that a host mentions before or during commercial breaks. This book is organized in a way that allows me to do that."
positive,"The Munich Olympic Massacre is finally examined: Without going into the historic details, this DVD is a masterpiece of documentary filming. Severely affecting, it made several members of my family cry throughout the film. By the time the movie ends, you will be deeply disturbed. This DVD is a must-have."
positive,"Great bag!: Bought this bag to carry textbooks recently, and it's a perfect size. It has 3 pockets - a cellphone pocket, a zippered pocket and a pouch pocket. I like this bag so much that I bought another one - not the same one but one that is a reversible tote."
negative,"Nice show but wait for the 3D version: Wait for Black Friday or the 3D version to be released,it gonna be like LOTR Bluray all over again.First version Theatrical version(normal length)Second Version Extended Cut"
negative,"Totally disappointing: Sorry to say, although Roland Barthes is an icon to some. This short book is self-indulgent, unintelligible, and therefore useless. The author is far more interested in himself than he is interested in the subject."
negative,"Shockingly Terrible: It's rare to a see a movie where it appears that the entire cast, director AND writer all phoned in their performances. But the Tailor of Panama is such a film. The heavy dialogue drowns itself and its actors, who don't seem to try to tread water. Rush and Brosnan are broad charicatures which might work in another film, but not here. The films jokes and attempts at wit are labored and artificial. What the heck does ""Casablanca without the heroes"" mean? The beauty of Casablanca was that there were no perfect heroes in that movie, everyone had their dark side. Watching this film made me flinch far too many times."
negative,"Story good, reading is abysmal! Don't do it!!: I have Always preferred to hear an author read their own works because only they really know what was intended--until now. Mr. Bradbury has one tone and one tone only and that is carried out with a mush-mouth. It's just horrendous and painful to listen to. Go find another copy--trust me (I would quit but I'm trying to finish it for a book club). Mercifully @ 5 CDs it's pretty short.Amendment: So after finishing, I must say that the last CD is just an interview with the author and it's really very interesting. If you'd like to hear him talk about his life, the books genesis, etc., skip to the last CD. I did enjoy that and it's almost like a different person speaking. He's so much more gregarious when just talking."
negative,"This generations ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"": What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie."
negative,"It scared me to death!!!!: I do not recommend this book at all. There is way too much discussion of what can go wrong and too much ""new age"" philosophy that is very strange to me. Elizabeth Noble is under the impression that she had a twin that died in utero and that influences the way she has gone about writing this book. This is very scary reading for any woman pregnant with twins."
negative,"Pathetic: Ok, ok their music can be ok e.g. All the things she said. But the track ""not gonna get us"" is so stupid and requires not talent. Plus those girls are not even lesbians, so please don't get this just because you think their lebians because their not. I feel sorry for the lesbians who bought this because they thought they where lesbians. Ontop of that their music is played on radio mtv all the time so its not like you don't hear them much. And yes the only avg song by them is ""all the things she said"", rest is [garbage]."
negative,"A Memory: There isn't much to add to the other comments except this: I attended the premiere of this little opus in Southern California back in the late '70s. Many of the stars, including Mae West, were in attendance. Afterward, making my way through the stunned crowd, I came face to face with Dom DeLuise. I will never forget the look that passed between us."
positive,"It was a fiction book...: I just finished to read Three Lions Roar.It is amazing! All times, dates, places for England National team became true. Please read the book and check the England's games. You will see how a fiction book comes to reality.Yes. I beleive it. This book is the Bible of England's fans.""England fans! Have the book. Keep it close to you. It will happen...""England will be the World Cup Champion again."
positive,"You Schmendrick, you!: I grew up with this movie. I had a tape and totally wore it out watching this movie so much. I make everyone I know watch this movie, whether they want to or not. So many great things about this: Alan Arkin, America, Jules Bass, Jealous Magical trees, etc."
positive,"My family and other animals: I read Gerald Durrell's books 10 years ago, while I was still living in Romania. I loved his books from the first page to the last and literally I couldn't put them down until I finished them. The best humour I ever met in books! His stile is unique. I am planning on reading all of them again in English. I would recommend them to anyone!"
positive,"You Watch Out!: There's been a lot of buzz about this actor Matt Riddlehoover (one very easy on the eye man) and this director Steve Balderson. I had to check it out for myself and watched it last night - some 4+ hours of material. The film - with and without commentary - plus over an hour of bonus video blogs. I've seen a lot of movies, but nothing quite like this. I'm still trying to absorb what I saw and heard. This is a keeper to watch again and again and well worth the price of admission. Act 1 is way-over-the-top-bizzaro-titillating comedy. I kept thinking - where is all this leading? Act 2 take an unexpectedly darker turn until the end. There's ample nudity - OK, more than ample. Someone ask Matt Riddlehoover if he did his own ""stunts"" and he said ""why, yes I did."" I'd say this film is a must see to believe, but that's just my opinion. I'll be waiting for Part 2!Sidenote: click on Steve Balderson's name."
negative,"handles fall off often: I was very excited to receive this, but had to return it after its 1st day in court... In one hour, I spent more time in fixing frequent handle fall-off issue than teaching tennis to my 6 yr old son."
positive,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would approve: I'm new to audio books. But, I'm afraid I've already been spoiled. I wonder if there could possibly exist a better combination of author and reader. Holmes sounds just the way you'd expect the great sleuth to sound. Deliberate, never rushed and always a gentleman.The story is carefully woven and the presentation of the characters by Timson is masterful. I've listened to it over several times and each time I appreciate a little more the complexity and the detail. The Musical interludes are brief and sparse, but definitely compliment. If you like Sherlock Holmes, Timson is the right reader for the job. I'm buying the big collection now."
positive,"The Best Book Ever!!: Eragon, By Christopher Paolini, is an outstanding book. You can never skip a page, for fear that a crucial link will be found. This book is a riveting novel. The description is so complete that you feel you are really there. Very hard to believe the author was only 15.Eragon is the first part in a series of books that tell the story of Eragon, a young boy who discovers a blue stone that is actually a dragon egg. Soon, the egg hatches. Eragon soon names her Saphira. Together, with an old storyteller, they embark on a quest to avenge his uncle's death. On the way, Eragon discovers his power within."
positive,Really nice ring: I bought this to go with my engagement ring. It's really sparkly and nice quality. Looks nice with my real diamond anniversary band
negative,"yuck: Why must I even start, why must I even tell you guys that this sucks. FATA is not a band you should mesure anything to, becuase FATA is a trendy band that sucks. This is also a trendy band that sucks. THANKS A LOT VICTORY! Why did Victory sell out, they have been selling these hard core boy bands by the dozen. How could a label that has bands such as Snapcase, Grade and Integrity go and sell out and sell crappy music. Be careful, if you see a new Victory band's cd don't buy it. Chances are the next cd Victory puts out will suck and will be ""screamo"" crap that has been destroying the scene. Don't listen to fake, glam ass hard-core."
positive,Mere words cannot do justice: Dune: Quite simply the most enthralling book I have ever read. Herbert's attention to detail and vision are unequalled and this book is a testament to this.
positive,"One mans junk is another mans treasure.......: This is one of the years best and certainly the best that Moby has put out. Those that accuse Moby of ripping off blues/gospel are in one word..jealous! Sorry you nay-sayers didn't think of it first. From the opening track Moby handles each sample with reverance, surrounding each with either deeply penetrating grooves or transcendent arrangements. A deeply moving much needed reprive from electronicas same 'ol stuff. This record can make the most uptight white boy want to get funky!"
positive,Magnetic North Is Amazing!: There is something soft and beautiful about Magnetic North and the rest of this amazing album by Sasha. It's very different than his previous original work the excellent Xpander EP. The album has floaty ambient qualities which takes you on a trance journey. If you are looking for full on trance like the Global Underground or Northern Exposure stuff then this CD is not for you. If you are looking for something to make you feel good then definitely check this release out.
positive,Plenty of action: This is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the author. I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantastic.The story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British. His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionaires.The action is non-stop and pretty interestng. It's a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deep.The only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth.
positive,Clarify Quanties: Very happy with the shopping services and the product but suggest much more clarity that ordering ONE really means a SET of FOUR weight plates.
positive,What a rich resource!: Drum Fun! (Musical Games for Groups) DVD by Kalani is an awesome resource! It is full of musical games my students love to play and learn from!
negative,"Excellent book, very poor e-book editing: Yet another example of an superb book done a serious disservice by e-book publishers.Multiple spelling errors, improperly placed figures & captions, whole sections of the book written in CAPS for some reason.If you are looking for an excellent reference on traditional timber framing, look no further, but please pick up the print version instead of the e-book."
negative,"boring: This movie is so predictable and boring. I seen this movie so many times before, couldn't they have gotten an original plot! And then the picture quality was bad. It felt like I was watching an 80's movie."
positive,"this cd is classic: I really liked this CD, it is courtney and hole at their best early in their career."
positive,"Question: This is really a question insteadof a review. I have a copy of Boots and Saddles written by Elizabeth B. Custer. The copyright is 1885, by Harper & Brothers. The first page has a note wrote on it ""To my friend Richard Dec 25th 1890 then a signature of the giver M L Malis ? Would you know anything about this particular book?"
positive,Cooky Book: One of my co-workers had the original and brought it in. This is the best. I gave it as a gift to my daughter who loves to bake.
positive,"Great read!: A great into to a wonderful part of North America and what is happening to it, to us as well over-develop every square inch. Great read!"
positive,"pleasantly surprised: I'm not normally a big fan of comics or the movies they inspire, but i was very pleasantly surprised. Highly recommend it."
negative,"One of my favorite movies, but...: I loved this movie as a child. I watched it easily over 100 times on the VHS copy. The problem I have is the quality of the DVD itself. The DVD goes unnaturally dark during the night scenes causing all the detail to be removed from the movie. Since there are a lot of scenes where the movie takes place at night/in the dark about a good 50% is almost ruined.Otherwise I love the story and the songs."
positive,"Absolutely Heavenly: I love every song. Each song is so unique and versatile in melody that I play it several times a day. Can't seem to get enough of him. Also bought the Christmas cd. Best songs are from Clay and Kelly, all the rest are ok."
negative,"Mormons Awake!: This guy just ""cans"" Mormonism, as he ""cans"" pretty much every ""faith"" other than his own, whatever that may be. I'm NOT Mormon and don't hope to be - but I did expect some sort of unbiased reporting from someone with an ""open mind"". He professes ""Christianity"" and tells us to keep to the ""straight and narrow"". But what exactly are HIS own views, and let's see him review THEM candidly and without bias. He forgets to mention that Christianity (per se) has so many ""holes"" in it that we shouldn't believe ANY of that, either. To each his own, I suppose."
negative,"Kindle edition NOT the Tom Stoppard translation!: I bought the Kindle edition of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard under the impression that it was the translation done by English playwright Tom Stoppard as the authorship of the item clearly states in Amazon's description. However, upon examining the title page of the Kindle book I was shocked to see someone else listed as the translator. I have not read this translation and therefore cannot review it, but I am extremely disappointed that Amazon is misrepresenting this item and they need to dix it!"
positive,superb: A novel full of action and adventure. Very detailed and specific description of the characters. Intersting through out the novel. A lot of literature tricks and hidden messages are at play. Great for disscusion. Simmilar to the book Coral Island.
positive,Great: This is perfect for the twins I have we go thought the smaller amounts very quick but I buy a couple big boxes and I'm covered for a while
negative,"Disappointing.: Regardless of what I have read here, I think this movie is not on the same technical or artistic merit as Akira or Ghost in the shell are. The graphic art is very poor, the story telling is also very badly done. Any one that is not a japanimation fan but does like pictures like the above mention, will find it as disappointing as I have. I do not recommend this title. don't waste your money ."
positive,"Comfort cookies: Remember the best cookies from your childhood? They probably came from a Betty Crocker recipe and this is THE book.Betty Crocker's Cooky BookThe best chocolate chip cookies, the best snickerdoodles, the best molasses crinkles--yes, they are all here and so much more. Take a trip back to the 1950s with the illustrations and overeat on pure nostalgia. And the cookies are great!"
negative,"""The Number"" is totally useless: This book contains nothing of use, whatsoever; it dances around what you need for your ""Number"", never providing any useful information or any insight. (No wonder the publisher concentrated on pre-publication sales; if I hadn't bought it before I could see it, I could have saved myself some money.) For real information about your Number, read William Bernstein, ""The Four Pillars of Investing"" (McGraw-Hill, 2002)."
negative,"I hated this book!: When i read Rebecca i decided i wanted to read anothor book by the same author. I picked this book because i thought this would be another fabulous book, but i tunred out boring and dull untill the very last page."
negative,"Not good for full suspension bikes.: The reviews in Amazon made me decide to buy this bike rack but now that I have it, it is obviously an over-rated product.The extending arms that hold the bike are thick especially towards the end which make it hard to fit a bike properly.I have a full suspension bike and even though I bought the extra bar to go between the seat and the handlebars, it is not very easy to put on and definitely doesn't feel safe (the bike is hanging by the seat which is not a fixed part.)The seat post strap is a nice feature but is also cumbersome.As far as the plastic, it's good to have the material of the rack softer than the bike so that in case of a bang you don't damage the bike.After using it for a few weeks I found that it is easier to put the bike on in reverse with the seat post strap towards the lower bar."
positive,"Wonderful Book: This is a wonderful book. I am new to the Catholic faith and had many questions. This book answered them all. It is very informative without being too long. I could not put it down. Now that I have finished reading, if I need to answer a quick question, I can look it up in this book. There are many misconceptions about the Catholic faith and this book set them all straight. It is wonderful for someone who is a cradle Catholic, a new Catholic, or protestant who wants to learn the truth about Catholicism."
positive,Loy-Powell set: Excellent set of Movies for all Nick and Nora fans. Our teen and sub-teen children love them making good family time.
negative,"Incorrect Product Information: The actual model of this meter is the i410, I am unsure where the number 617727 is relevant as Fluke doesn't identify it with this number. I suspect this is a component of some kit, which is defunct and therefore the reason for the strange model number. There are a few vendors that list this part number, but I also suspect this is a single-sourced inventory item. A lot of speculations, but what else are we supposed to do?[...]After one review that states the inaccuracy, AMAZON should have this rectified.There is not a valid excuse to keep a listing that is know to be inaccurate.That being said, the i410 is an excellent instrument.AMAZON is usually fair about inaccuracies when it comes to returns. If someone purchased this and did not return it, maybe AMAZON did not look at the listing.I suggest those looking for a current probe visit the link in this review and proceed from there. The review is for the improper listing."
negative,"Robbed of 85 minutes of my life & I want my money back!: Take heed! Don't rent/buy or even watch this movie for free! Instead, get yourself some bubbly toilet bowl cleaner and watch it bubble for 85 minute - you'll have a MUCH better time. Yes, parodies can be funny, (Think Airplane! or Scary Movie) but when a studio stoops to pump out watered down trash like this it just ends up turning off people from an entire genre. The length of this move shows 85 minutes. 5 for credits & another 5 for repeated flashbacks, (which serve no purpose than to take up space) and you are down to 75 of pure trash. Why oh why?"
positive,"""I'm Gumby, dammit!"": 60 minutes of Gumby and his buddies in full color!Eight delightful adventures:1.Gumby Concerto2. Gold Rush Gumby3. Gumbasia4. Mysterious Fires5. Robot Rumpus6. Stuck on Books7. Too Loo8. Tricky Trainy"
positive,"Great plot involving the supernatural: Sarah keeps seeing her cat Shadow. Her dead cat Shadow. Things are happening too fast for Sarah. Her older brother is home from college, her mother hires a new housekeeper, and Shadow keeps appearing in dreams. Her brothers fight often and their parents ignore them. Nobody believes that Shadow is there. Then it happens, the reason why Shadow had stayed instead of processeding on to the cat afterlife.Shadow is a nice, spenceful book that mixes in a bit of supernatural into the usual (if extreme) problems of life. The characters are well delevoped and rounded off nicely."
positive,"No Bridge Too Far Part 1: This DVD is absolutely OUTSTANDING!It covers a segment of operation that was so critical to our success in WW2 - Army Engineers.I did not want the video to end and am anxious for the next in the series!It was not only the contents of the DVD but its production, the music, the photos, and everything that make this a must have for anyone that has an interest in WW2."
positive,"One of the best!: Very enjoyable book.when u start reading u can't close the book.after u finish reading it ,all u talk about is Eragon .I can't wait to c it on screen.Waiting to read eldest..."
positive,"Stainless Steel 10 inch Covered Fry Pan: I have a larger fry pan but, this 10 inch is a perfect size for smaller dishes. I have been so pleased with this pan. It is one beautiful stainless fry pan."
negative,"Where, oh, where, were the spiders?: I'd heard so many good things about this album, and must say that it's the biggest disappointment I've heard so far this year. We get Bowie sounding frankly bored while generic alt-rock guitars and miscellaneous noise try to capture the brilliance of his earlier albums.Listen to the album honestly, and count how many times Bowie actually hits a note or does something that doesn't sound like a bad cover band lethargically ripping through parodies of his hits.Even Pat Boone doing metal was better than this."
positive,"The best one I have ever heard !!!: Psycho Circus is more than Psycho. It's amazing, incredible, awesome and everything good !!!"
negative,"I hate it: because I believe in God through Jesus Christ and DeNiro curse God. I though to give to the library, but I did not agreed with it because it was not a solution so I break it and trash it."
negative,"21st Century Caveland: WOW, over 700 pages of tea drinking, 5 minute formal introductions for every personal encounter, 21st century medicine and anatomy lessons, social welfare reform, and Giorgio fashion statements. Also noteworthy to mention are the condo living arrangements, wine and Tupperware parties, oral hygiene practices, and western Christian ceremonies for deaths and weddings. I loved the parts that told the spirits to ""go to the light"" or they ""tied the knot"" and were mated. All of this knowledge of humanity, medicine, art, and civilization and they still can't figure our how babies are made. Go figure!I only finished this book because I waited 12 years for the continued saga. What a waste of time. I skimmed over pages of pure bunk including ceremonial songs and chants. Ayla is of course WONDERFUL. Without her, I guess we would still be swinging from the trees.Wait for the paperback to show up at Goodwill for a dime, then it might be a bargain."
positive,Awsome movie: i love vin diesel and i would die for him if i was older but i'm only 14 years old i would love to see him if i could afford to fly over to california and see him just for one time i would like to spend one whole day with him.
negative,"Too stupid to even smile at: ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is just another teenie-bopper-sex comedy movies to go along with the rest of the teenie-bopper...comedies....There is no real plot. Just two morons who woke up after a...night before (where many teenie-boppers will laugh at) and they can't find their car. And they are to stupid to even know what happened. This movie was made to draw in teenie-boppers, and it succeeded. But smart people who toally despise the teenie-bopper era, like myself, will stay away from this..."
positive,"Slightly dated but still good mystery: Quite a few suspects and a nasty murder--but the victim was really asking for it. You will probably guess whodunnit, but there is still a lot of fun getting there. Good essence of time and place with the characters being well drawn. A little long, but a speedy reader can handle it."
negative,"So sad, such a wonderful machine: We absolutely loved the Keurig for 2 1/2 months, then it just started acting up. One never knew when they would get a cup of coffee. Idea is wonderful; the engineering needs to go back to the drawing board. I am sorry I did not pay attention to the poor reviews. :("
positive,Great historical fiction novel: A real page turner! I had a hard time putting it down. One never knows what to expect. Enjoy it!
positive,"Our favs: We tried 4 or 5 different kinds of diapers when our son was born from all the samples and such. We got a pack of these from a neighbor and they worked the best of all, so we've stuck with these. You can tell how wet the diaper is by feeling how inflated the diaper is. Wish I was using cloth diapers but that didn't really work out for us due to logistics (no washer) and I wish I had a more ""natural"" choice, but others are more expensive and don't work as well. These are 14.5 cents a diaper w/ Amazon Mom."
positive,"Great little product: This thing does what it says it does, has three cutting attachments to hit any angle you need, and nearly zero instructions to confuse the heck out of you. Very, very straightforward and easy to use product. If you are looking to spend very little money for very good value, this is a product worth your time and cash."
negative,"Why is this called Mission Impossible?: First off I enjoyed the film greatly. Having said that, why make a film and call it Mission Impossible then make it so that it is the exact opposite of the TV series. I could just about accept the plot apart from the apalling travesty of making the baddie Jim Phelps. I would like to know how Paramount could sanction this. It is no wonder Peter Graves wanted nothing to do with it."
negative,Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 5-1/2-Cup Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker: Unfortunately we didn't get to use this as we fell for the old 120 volt appliance into a 240 volt supply. Blew the buggery out of it. Be warned that if you want to use it in Australia it is not dual voltage. A good thing to remember if buying other appliances from America.
negative,"Terrible ending: Until the ending of this book, I was sure that it was going to rate a 10. After finishing it, I can say that I do not remember being this disappointed in a books conclusion in my life. This book left me depressed, and wishing that I would have never read it. Certainly one does not have to tidy things up all the time but to purposely have people act out of character is unforgivable sin for an author. I very much cared for the individuals in this book and at the end felt very manipulated by the author. Do not read this book."
negative,"Great film, bad print: This is an historic film version, but the print I just purchased from Amazon is of very poor quality. If you go to Netflix, a much better print can be viewed streaming (and it's free to Netflix subscribers). This version for sale on Amazon should be retired. Amazon, please do something!"
positive,"Feel the groove: If you like funk and you don't own this CD, stop reading my review and ORDER THE CD...then come back and read the rest of course...this is one of the most groove-heavy and funky CD's I've ever heard...just in the first track alone when Maceo goes at it with Kenwood Dennard (drums) and they solo together it is so funky. if you can't feel the groove this disc will help you find your way to the groove...this is what you need...anyone who likes funk should get this CD by ALL and ANY means possible!"
positive,"Winchester is good quality: I like this tool a lot. Although a bit heavy and large, it is very good quality for the price. I am also particularly fond of my Winchester knives."
positive,Inspiring to tree-huggers!: This book is a great book for those who care about the earth. There are so many great quotes and stories that are still relevant to our societal values. We use this book at camp to open campers' eyes to the world around them. The contents are a great inspiration and conversation starters.
negative,"Simply Borred: Borred, Borred and very borred!! to much bla bla! I spected that this book would say something about ancient phylosopy, something to think about, but never get it, it is very borred."
negative,"Slow read: There wasn't much of a plot. The author, used commas, just about, everywhere. Made it very difficult to read. It might have been avant-garde when it was introduced in the early 19th century but now, it's just a slow read where nothing happens."
negative,A $49.95 value?: I was not thrilled with the advertising on this one that claimed it was a luxury towel set with a $49.95 value. The set came in a plastic bag and the quality of the towels were very low average. I was not impressed and wish I had not bought so many.
positive,"A Dark Look At Prison Life: Brute Force is a surprisingly tough look at life in a prison, given the time when it was made. Burt Lancaster stars as an inmate who plans his escape to be with his critically ill girlfriend, Ann Blyth. He enlists the help of his cellmates and an older, experienced inmate, Charles Bickford. Standing in their way is a brutal, ambitious guard played very well by Hume Cronyn. There are a number of great scenes in the movie, including Cronyn's beating of an inmate to the sound of classical music, and the death in a giant press of an inmate that informed. The performances are good, the film moves at an excellent pace, and the ending surprised me somewhat, again given the time that it was made. Brute Force is a very good movie."
positive,"adidas Kids' Absolute TRX Firm Ground Soccer Shoe,White/Black/Gold: The price was perfect for a brand new cleat. It wasn't shipped as fast as another competitor and was delayed by 1 day. However, the price made up for the time of delivery."
negative,"Anyone For Pig On A Stick?: I didn't like this book because of the gruesome behavior of Jack and the other boys on the island. They had been out of civilization for so long that killing a pig, or even each other, sounded like so much fun they couldn't resist it. I would give this book two thumbs down. Don't read it if you don't have to"
negative,"One erotic passage in the entire book.: I kept thinking that Elliot and Lisa would really get down and dirty at the ""Club"". Was I disappointed when they actually only had sex once, and in New Orleans to boot!!! I will say that the one time they did have sex was worth the price of the book. But the rest of it was very poorly written."
negative,"To Reiterate VERSION 2 does NOT WORK WITH TIVO: Version 2 of this adapter will not work with TIVO. TIVO will not recognize this version the WG111. To find the right card make sure to look at the SERIAL NUMBERS on the box. They must start with '130' or 'WG72' if they don't have those serial numbers, you are out of luck."
negative,"Phoning it in, and on a bad connection at that: As others have stated, there's just nothing funny about this one. Clearly trying to cash in on the predecessor, but without any thought toward creative content. Rather, make some bodily function jokes and hope nobody notices. Skip this one."
positive,"A Classic Theme In Life: I rapidly read this book in high school for a test the next day. I knew that I wanted to read it again because it was so good and I was missing the subleties. I loved it. The theme is that our lives are goverened by what we think of ourselves. Poor Tess was so wrong, but for the times understandable. Hardy writes without including the graphic details, but the story remains. A story that is suspended in time."
positive,"All I can say is wow!: Clay Aiken's voice shines on this CD!!!! I bought this and well, I have bought one for my mom for her birthday. She has not been able to put it down!! She has listened to it over and over. Thank you Clay for a wonderful album and I can't wait till the next one!"
positive,"Shoegazers, get this album!!: Very dreamy, shoe-gazer pop reminiscient of Catherine Wheel (in fact, the lead vocals sounds very much like Rob Dickinson's hushed vocals on ""Ferment"" 15 years prior), only with tighter beats and more dramatic drone where appropriate. These guys are ultra-personable on-stage as well so it will come as no suprise when they're playing live on the O.C. Season Finale (not that it would be a bad thing)."
negative,Absolute Waste of Time: My 11th grade English teacher tortured me with this morbid book and I can't say if I'll ever forgive her. Not only was this this book boring but Hawthorne unnecesary uses all sorts of complex language to convey one simple thought. The only reason that I didn't give this book 1 star was because there was some art in the book and symbolism. WAY OVERRATED.
positive,"Fantastic album, but their second is a bit stronger: I really hate how it seems that everytime a metalcore band is starting to hit their stride they go ahead and break up. Deadguy, Kiss It Goodbye, Spread the Disease, Botch...etc. The list goes on and on. Maharahj is on that list too and its a shame for they are probably the very best of all gone-before-their-time metalcore bands. Their debut album is packed end to end with all of that uber-technical yet strangely listenable chaotic noise that fans of this stuff love and Maharahj do it better then just about everyone with few exceptions. They improved on their second album Repetition to a point of near perfection but this album is still more then worth picking up."
negative,"Very disappointing: I picked this up while traveling and thought it would be a fun read on holiday. It wasn't. While I can understand the author's anger at herself and her former husband and life, it is cumbersome to read. She has great distain for most men and overweight people. Despite traveling to numerous locations around the world, her writing reads like a diary and is often repetitive. While I'm sure this was cathartic for her, it just wasn't interesting. It is highly judgmental of others. The book abruptly ends when she boards the plane to fly home. I only read through the entire book to see what kind of impact the trip had on her life after returning home. Very disappointing."
negative,"Meh...: This game is nothing compared to Shadow Hearts and Shadow Hearts Covenant. I really did not get attached to the characters like I did with the previous games. I enjoyed the bit roles from old characters like Lenny, Roger Bacon, Keith Valentine etc. but they were just that...tiny roles. And the Valentine sister, so annoying. If you really want a good game, play Shadow Hearts Covenant. I could play that game everyday, forever :)"
negative,"Don't waste your money: I notice that 9 of the reviews are posted by the same person, A Customer. It looks like the author is trying to get a better rating by making up reviews. The book is trash don't buy it."
negative,"Studio Executives Seriously Out To Lunch: I do believe that the studio executives who a) thought the remake would be a good idea and b) allowed it to be made the way it was should be forced to work at McDonald's for the rest of their lives. This movie was laughingly bad - particularly if you've seen the timeless and still very scary original. Once again Hollywood chooses FX over everything else (plot, character development, etc.). If you are the kind of person who needs to be spoon fed your entertainment - having everything explained to you every step of the way and can't believe in it if you don't see it, you will certainly enjoy this video. If you want to see a classic haunted house story and be scared, then get the original movie with Claire Bloom."
negative,"Tries Too Hard: I hate this movie. I think Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey was much better. I even love Malcolm McDowell and think he is a great actor, but that wasn't enough to redeem this movie. I am dating myself here, but when this movie first came out I think people were into it for shock value alone. I think this movie tries too hard to be avant-garde. There was nothing that made me care anything about what happened to any of the characters in the film, either the perpetrators of violence or their victims. Watching this movie is like banging your head into a wall over and over."
positive,"Everyone Wants an Ocean Wonders: I purchased the Ocean Wonders for our 4 month grandson. He loved it, but our other older grandchildren, 19 months and 29 months, wouldn't let him play with it. The sounds and the fish in the water excited the 4 month old. He will definitely enjoy the toy as he grows."
positive,"best modern reggae album: This NYC group has authentic early reggae/rocksteady sound. The music features great organ and tight rhythm section. The lyrics are just right for the mood of each song. Includes a brilliant rocksteady version of Johnny Cash's ""Long Black Veil"" -- best remake of this classic song I've heard. If you didn't know, you'ld swear it was the late 60s and you were catching Jamaican radio broadcasts."
positive,"Every page has many a turn of phrase: I read this together with my teenage son, him for English class, and me for pure enjoyment and a re-read. We actually listened to the audible version as we read along on my Kindle - our own kind of 'full immersion' experience. What I found is that giving Dickens my full attention (vs. listening while e.g. doing yardwork, driving, etc.) really made a huge difference in my experience of this book - because there are do many delightful nuggets throughout this book! It was rewarding and fun to see in my mind's eye, and take pleasure in, the huge banquet of tasty and very often humorous nuggets offered. Many are in passing, like when Pip is in Wemmick's guest bedroom, with the head of the bed so close to the flagpole that he feels as if he's spending the night balancing the pole on his forehead."
negative,"save your money: This book is little more than a pamphlet. It's written totally for men in the younger age brackets. I also bought and read I Can't Believe I'm Buying This Book: A Commonsense Guide to Successful Internet Dating. That book is much better, and has much broader scope and depth. Save your money on this one."
negative,Paranoiac...: This record gives one a nightmare. This kind of music needs to stay in the nineties where it belongs.
negative,"its okay: the brow powder its just ok. I just wouldn't expect this from a product that cost almost $30.00, for me it should cost like $6.00. It doesn't stay on for long and if you have dark eyebrows like me you cant even see that is on."
negative,Horrible Scans: I picked up this device to replace a ten year old HP Deskjet & a Canon scanner.It didn't print as well as the old Deskjet & the picture scans were horrible with lines in the image & it didn't seem to have enough gray levels as b/w pictures were clipped
negative,The Sword in The Stone: There are parts in the book that start to bore you at times. T.H. White puts anachronisms to make it more interesting. The book was not very thrilling. The book can seem like it is never ending. But I'd say that this book is plain boring. It does have some adventure. I did not like it. I DONT RECCOMEND IT!
positive,"Great, Except for this...: Well, this movie was nice. It had more action, was more funny than ""The Mummy"", and was sad because that girl was killed. I keep forgetting her name. Her actress was Rachel something, wasn't it? Either way, this has more action, and you know what. But it seems like Johnathan is the only one that's ten years older. Well ,you have to see this, even though I may have some harsh comments."
negative,"A well-intentioned but disastrous project.: Unfortunately, Jerry Rivera does not posess the soul or voice of the late Frankie Ruiz so this tribute CD (while well-intentioned) is disastrous. His cover versions of Frankie's classics ""Desnudate Mujer"",""Tu Eres"", ""El Camionero"" and ""Separemos Nuestras Vidas"" are ludicrous at best. Frankie was one of the 1980's and '90s best salsa soneros and Jerry Rivera is quite simply NOT in his league."
positive,Heavy and big but do a great job: I needed to carry 4 bikes on a camping trip so I purchased this 2 bike extension. It is as solid and easy to use as the main bike carrier it was added to. Once the heavy lifting is done and this rack is in your hitch your bikes snap in and out with ease. I nicked it one star because it is a bit heavy and perhaps a lighter metal alloy could have been used when manufacturing these.
positive,"State of Play: These Miniseries are excellent, if you like sophisticated scripts, good acting, intelligent ambiance, this is for you. No one can beat the British on this genre."
positive,"A book I always give my friends.: This book changed my life, and I've reread it several times already. I've always read the Bible and assumed that the stories I read there were not for today, until I read this book. After reading this book, I realized that if God could work the same miracles He did in my hometown of New York, then he could work anywhere in this world. And He does!"
positive,"I really enjoy the series.: Ever since I read Clan of the Cave bear and its sequel The Valley of Horses, I have been looking for books just like it. If i were you, i would rush to the bookstore or the library and get it. Don't wait. Its a good book."
negative,Poor Formatting: Middlemarch is one of my favourite books but the experience of reading it on Kindle is marred by poor formatting. When looking at the sample on the Amazon store the bad formatting is not obvious. Why is it the kindle editions of books give no contents pages. I am uncertain whether I want to buy an edition of this book because I cannot tell if the formatting will be any more worth it in the paid for editions. If I did not know the book really well I am not sure if I would be able to follow it with the often confusing format. The quotations at the beginning of each chapter are presented just as part of the text and their is no space between chapters which is really very bad.
positive,"Worked Well: The screen panel worked well. I was a bit concerned that it would not fit the commercial grade canopy, but it worked fine with a little rigging, so as to ensure access to the front of the canopy, which I didn't want closed off."
positive,"Magic, on Blu Ray, starrring Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret is a well crafted film.: I like this BluRay release of the Anthony Hopkins/Ann Margret film. The BluRay transfer was done very nicely and the extras were pretty good but could have been better.I really enjoyed the Dennis Alwood interview, Fats and Friends. I do wish there were new interviews with Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret though. There is an old, archival Anthony Hopkins interview which leaves much to be desired. Though it's better than nothing."
positive,"Better Than Harry Potter: Much better than Harry Potter and a great way to introduce a classic- with an actor a child can associate with. If your children like Harry Potter, this is a must have."
positive,hot: Ann Rice writes erotica like no one else!! A must have for your library. Other favorites are her Sleeping Beauty series. Definitely not for the prudish. She has the ability to pull you in and connect to the characters. I couldn't put them down!
positive,A favorite shoe and style of mine: I love the Breeze Walker sandal. I gave it 4 stars because they changed their sole. At least that is my opinion. I am going to call the manufacturer to check. What I am referring to is that it seems to be a man-made composition instead of the way it used to be leather. As a result I feel like it is slippery if there is perspiration. Other than that it is a very comfortable walking shoe.
positive,"My nephews love them!: I purchased 2 of them for my nephews so that they don't fight with one another. My only complain is the flashlight, very poor quality. The light keeps going off and on, even with a new battery. I think it's a connection problem. Aside from that... my nephews love them."
positive,"Awesome CD!!: Stacie Orrico is one talented teenager! I have to say, I was very surprised to find she was so young! I think it's wonderful and refreshing to have someone like Stacie Orrico in Christain Music. It sort of puts the ""life"" into the Christain Music for the average young person (or young at heart!:) who may find other Christain groups a bit dull or the music outdated. I bought this CD about a month ago and I can't stop listening to it. My daughter loves it too. I think the best songs are ""Without Love"", and ""Restore My Soul"". I didn't like every song at first, but they have a wonderful message and a catchy tune and I love them all now. If you like Christina Aguilara and Mariah Carrey, you'll LOVE Stacie Orrico."
negative,"Recycled And Then Some: RE-CYCLED VINYL BLUES represents the first time I have ever been disapointed by any music Neil Innes has been associated with.Maybe I'm giving him too much credit, but I always thought Innes was an overlooked genius who could turn virtually anything into an interesting tune. This CD proves me wrong. The production is thick and muddy, the playing is slow and slovenly, and the lyrics are dull and lifeless.The only redeeming tracks here are ""Lie Down And Be Counted,"" an acoustic strummer with a sense of humor and some tasty backing vocals, and ""How Sweet To Be An Idiot,"" which fits in with some of the very best of Innes' catalog. Too much of the rest of the record sounds like Innes and some studio hacks trying to fulfill contractual obligations.Thank God for the Rutles."
positive,"A Story For Everybody: This book stands alone as one of the most powerful and easily read books of all time. Bunyan's simple style makes every point clear and without the possibility for misinterpretation. A tale of life and its trials, this book should be read by all."
positive,"Womanist Theory: I really appreciated how African women adopted and nurtured the term ""womanist"" to accommodate our experiences, cultural realtiies and socio-political stances. Kolawole's essays do an excellent job in capturing one African woman's perspective. I gave it 4 stars because she asks us not generalize and group all African women's experiences, yet frequently makes overarching statements about African women's values.Great academic text and is very helpful in my analysis of other ways African women operate in the private sphere."
positive,Liked: I liked this book. The characters are very enjoyable and the plot was interesting. It was a little predictable though...
negative,"Worst movie I've ever seen.: Simply the worst movie I've ever seen. If I could give it negative stars, I would.Dont waste your money."
positive,"Step-by-step photos cover these techniques in depth: The craft, art and restoration techniques for stained glass are explained in Pere Valldeperez's Stained Glass, a practical, ""user friendly"" guide which goes beyond competitors which merely display stained glass. Step-by-step photos cover these techniques in depth and detail: art students working in the medium will find this an essential coverage."
positive,"Pretty Good-But then again, I don't read many books...: Wow, this book iz pretty good. Its about this girl named Patty Bergen who lives in Jenkensville, Arkansas. Okay, now these WWII Nazi prisoners come to stay at a pison thing nearby, and one of them, Anton Reiker escapes. Now Patty fell in love with Anton, and supposedly, he loved her too. But then, he ran away from her house(not willingly!), and Patty accidently admitted to sheltering and hiding him. I must admit that the ending was a bit disapointing, but then, it leaves the way for the sequel, which I want to read. I reccomend this book to people over the age of 14(don't ask me y). Overall, as I said before, its pretty good."
negative,"DON'T purchase from godsnet!: I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my grandson. I FULLY admit my mistake; I thought it was a DVD version not a VHS. Immediately after I hit the purchase button, I caught my error. At that moment, (not more than 1 minute after purchase) I sent an email explaining that I was sorry but I didn't want the item. I sent a total of THREE requests to please cancel the order. I didn't receive a single response from them. My VHS version of Robin Hood came in the mail and the money was deducted from my account. The VHS tape is still sitting on my dresser in the original mailing box, in the wrapper and of no use to me. I will NEVER purchase again from godsnet and would STRONGLY recommend others not to. I made a mistake yes, and would not be leaving a negative response if they would have just contacted me. No response at all makes me question the ethics of this company. RED FLAGS are up for a reason."
negative,"Poor quality - leaking: The swaddlers are wonderful diapers, never had any problems, however, the Dry Baby diapers are terrible. We have gone though one box of them, and still have another one to go before we switch over to cloth (this is not the reason we are switching to cloth). My son has woken up several nights in a row completely wet and we've been having to change the sheets. They leak horribly. Even daycare hates them. We've had so many blowouts as well. They are incredibly thin and cheap feeling."
positive,"Less than Smith is capable of doing.: Wilbur Smith is my favorite author, but I was disappointed in this book. It appeared to be written hastily and without the wonderful descriptive phrases he normally uses to paint his stories background. Never the less I still read it cover to cover."
negative,Disappointed!: I'm disappointed because my daughter has no interest in this set at all. But she loves the Volume II collection.
positive,"This CD is Great!: I have this CD! I like ""Adventure Heart~Davis's theme~""and number17 music,number1 song. Number1 song'sJapanese title is""Target~Akaishougeki~"" Number17'sJapanese title is ""Kenchan..wormmonnotheme."" This music is my favorititeits. Number17music is like a Japanesemusic""Kamatakousinkyoku"" I think very similar.but I like very much!(^-^) I recommend this CD! Tonikaku osusume! ..sorry..this sentence is strenge..and funny!(T-T) sorejya situreisimasu~! Emi"
negative,"Dreadful: After reading The year of the death of Ricardo Reis a book I thought was one of the best ever written and Blindness (not quite the best book ever written) I thought by buying this I was in for a good read...wrong!Jose Saramago continues his bizarre obsession with young women being attracted to decrepid old men (as he does in all his books) The story is thin, uninteresting and leads nowhere and the siege (read massacre) of the Muslims of Lisbon by the 'brave' crusader knights seems to have little to do with the plot apart from add a little sexual sleeze (the gang rape of a Arab woman by crusader knights) and some ill placed Portuguese nationalism."
positive,Kid loves it: My daughter loves this. Very simple/basic design and materials make up this toy. Good value all around. . . .
positive,"Addictive and Very Fun!: This game is totally addictive. If you have time to kill, play it. You will be so wrapped up in getting tasks done on there that you will literally forget about real life. It's nice to forget about things for a hour or so and play a carefree, non-competitive game."
negative,"Slow motion-no motion Lava lamp: I am disappointed in this lava lamp. After waiting for nearly eight hours for the 'lava' to start moving, it finally made a slight move upward. That was it. The lamp makes a nice night light but it is NOT a lava lamp. More like an oil-filled glass container with a blob of wax stuck at the bottom.Do not waste your money on this product. You would be better off going to Spencer's."
negative,horrible: This is not the Triumvirat I grew up with. No original members. Disco at it's worse. SUCKS!!!
positive,"Works Great!: This was a breeze to setup. It gets great signal considering it is on the second floor diagonal from the AP which resides on the first floor. If you need to connect wirelessly to your TiVo, this is the device to get."
negative,"One of the WORST movies ever made: Bad acting, unbelivable action shots, terrible dialogue, no plot, what more can I say than xxx is a waste of money and time."
negative,"Painfully Inaccurate: This movie is so painfully inaccurate, one could assume it was written by someone who not only has no notion of who Joan of Arc was historically, but also has no reverence for her as a saint. Joan of Arc had two brothers, not a sister. Domremy was not attacked by the Burgundians or the English, as it was already English territory. Joan heard the voices of Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, and Saint Michael. Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret were the dominant voices. She also spoke of the voices comforting her, not terrorizing her for following their direction. I despise this representation of Joan as a broken, pathetic, and incredibly insane antihero. Anyone who has given the time and thought to reading her trial transcripts would know that she was so much more than this film could possibly pretend to portray."
positive,"Good printer, bad for Mac computers: This is a great computer, but unfortunately it only uses Windows----which I have a Mac. It is a good printer, but make sure you have Windows before purchasing or it's a big hassle.BTW--it's B&W; only & works very well!!"
positive,"Color Heroes: A very extensive review of all that goes into good quality illustrations and comic books. There is minimal text, and MANY illustrative examples. This book covers everything you need, from tools to terms, in order to design a classic comic panel. I recommend for all cartoonists and illustrators."
positive,"In 1993, this movie was a cinema ride.: Mario and Lugig, (Based on the characters from the popular Nintendo video game) are two Brother plummers from Brooklyn, the two embark on a adventure. When Dasiy, a beautiful young woman is kidnapped and is taken to another world, ruled by a evil ruler named Koppa. Mario and Lugig with the help of Koopa's cousins Iggy and Spike, both rescue the princess and save the dimension from Koppa's humanity."
positive,"Guaranteed classic: This was not an easy tale to read, and I have to admit that it took a few chapters read before I could truly delve in and appreciate the story. The story was well written, especially having been revised from the original 1937 writing. I am not disappointed; however, I am concerned that the movie version (2012) release will fail to include minute details detrimental to the theme. I highly recommend this book to be read by those seeking an adventure based on a different time period in another world."
negative,"Coffee hardly warm after 15 min.: I was just hoping for it to keep my coffee somewhere close to hot for a while. My coffee, in a normal coffee mug, is barely warm after 10-15 minutes on this. Yeah, it's warmer than it would be without it but I still have to go warm it up with fresh coffee if I want to enjoy it. My expectations were low. I don't even like my coffee very hot. Did NOT expect this thing to let me down but it has. It keeps my coffee at about 5 seconds worth of microwaving."
positive,I THINK IT IS VERY GOOD!: I HAVE REVIEWED THE FIRST TWO FILMS ALREADY. ALL THREE FILMS I GIVE 5 STARS. I LIKE THE NEW STORY!
positive,"Paco de Lucia's performance of Aranjuez: I've only listened to the first movement of the Concierto de Aranjuez as played by Paco de Lucia, which is included in a Paco de Lucia anthology (thus I can only rate the first track of this CD, while not having heard the rest of the CD). Paco and the Orquesta de Cadaques really put the Spirito in the Allegro of the first movement. It's the best performance I've heard--full of rythmic energy and excitement. I think the flamenco guitar (I'm assuming that's the instrument Paco is playing) and technique are most suitable for the first movement. On the other hand, I suspect the classical guitar may be more suitable for the more famous second movement (John Williams' performance with the Seville Orchestra being my favorite)."
positive,"Revealing and well written: I have read that book in a day. Not only the text is very revealing and well written, the art in this book is realy realy good. Very good for every Storyteller who want's to bring some light onto lillith."
negative,Stinks: I am sorry but this CD just does not work. You are better off buying the single mp3 that you want to listen to. Buying the complete CD is a waste.
negative,"A Waste of a Picture: This picture is a complete waste, considering it had nothing to offer, even the perversion in the film becomes trite and tiring, by the end, I had hoped that all the characters would wind up dead because they are uninteresting. The director thinks that he is being morally ambiguous by presenting Bardem as a villain who rapes and plunders all form of human decency but actually he is being silly. The film never knows if it is being a slasher film or a comedy, but by the end, who really cares as long as this disaster is over?...."
negative,"How many different plot lines at the same time?: Wow, truly how many plot lines can you put into a single movie? We start with the creation of the 4th Reich by escaping SS troops and scientists. Then we get zombie super troopers, forced abortion as a cure, a nazi spaceship, robo-hitler, etc... Don't pay more than $5 for this movie, that includes shipping. It had a few funny moments, but not many. The special effects weren't too bad, at least it wasn't a rocket on a string with a fire cracker in the tail. The actors were mostly supporting actors tossed into leading roles, or more like co-leading roles."
positive,"Wonderfully heart-lifting!: I truly enjoyed this book as I became a part of the story, letting myself love every moment of the innocent happiness (or afraid of the different obstacles that could've made the whole story come crashing down). (My name is Amanda : ) ) and I love how this book reminds us to never give up our dreams!!!"
negative,"Keep walking: Every good artist has an album that should have been taken out and shot.With Queen, it's this one.Olly Buxton"
positive,"Sadly...One and done.: For those of you who remember those early days of the 1990's, where Big Hair, Cross Colours, and great dance music. New Jack was at it's absolute height, Damian Dame delivered a musical masterpiece with their debut album. I loved every track on the CD, and after all these years, I recently found a copy of the CD and have been listening to it and enjoying it. ""Love Come Near Me"", and ""Virgin Island"" are among my favorite cuts. Sadly, both members of the group died on the exact same day two years apart, one from cancer, and the other from injuries sustained in a car accident. Never the less, they delivered a beautiful album on the LaFace label."
negative,"Shows the power of a director's name: One of the very worst movies ever made with no redeeming value, horrible acting, worthless in every way. This is a great example of how ""art"" can be used to defend useless crap."
negative,"Stink-o-rama: This is a disapointing, [try] at an action romance story.It puts young Jackson against a freaky mucus covered monster who is only defeated when a shingle falls on it."
negative,"Ungodly Awful: Are you sure this wasn't a parody of a bad '60's English thriller?Horrible directing - no surprise (Preminger). Terrible dialog. Lots of bad acting (Olivier is good, however). Ridiculous situations. Horrible editing (Ed Wood, Jr.?). And worst of all - a third act that is just interminable. I think it's still going on - I don't know, I had to leave after they repeated the same stupid gimmick four times (or more - I don't know 'cause I left).Oh...also, why The Zombies? I mean I like them but...what...the...hell?Also, doesn't anyone in England lock their doors? Talk about re-using a cheap gimmick...Tuer l'idole"
negative,"Santa's gone surfin'.: The idea was a good one: surf music versions of Christmas songs. But the excecution leaves a lot to be desired. The problem is that, while the album has the trappings of surf music, it doesn't feel like ""real"" surf music. Probably because ""The Wave Benders"" aren't a real surf group. The album was recorded by a bunch of studio musicians in Amsterdam, of all places. So, what we have here is an album of generic ""surf music"" versions of Christmas songs."
positive,"JOHN CARTER OF MARS BETTER THAN ANY JEDI KNIGHT!: A PRINCES OF MARS IS A THRILLING SWASH BUCKELINGSTAR WARS TYPE BOOK WITH ROMANCEADD FOR FLOVER, IT IS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE SERIES EVEN BETTER THAN TARZAN, IF YOU LIKE SI FIFANNISY,YOU WILL LIKE THIS BOOK IT IS A GREAT ADVENTER STORYOF NO COMPARE! EXECTING ,FILLED WITH ACTION!"
positive,"A review of the album: Peter Tosh / Legalize It: It is tempting to spend some time correcting other reviewers who have asinine ideas about Reggae music and who have slandered the memory of Peter Tosh with their personal attacks on him, but this is a place for reviewing the music, so I will proceed to do just that. Peter Tosh did Reggae music about as well as anyone ever has and this debut solo album shows his emerging talent. However, apart from the title track, these are not his strongest songs. This album is an enjoyable Four Star release."
positive,"Get entertained with Great Expectations: Great Expectations is filled with ambition, greed, cruelty, and love. It is one of the best books I have ever read in my high school years. Get entertained with Mr. Joe and her violence towards Pip and her husband Mr. Joe Gargery.Also, Pip travels to France to become a gentlemen, which is one of the best parts of this novel."
negative,"Made Things Worse: When I received my order, it was obvious that it was repackaged (a previous return). That was my first hint. At the very least I was hoping for some marginal improvement on a couple of channels. However, after installing this device, I actually lost a couple of channels.It could be a defective device, I don't know. This definitely isn't worth the money."
negative,retarded son of a cousin twiced removed of JA 2: it is ok for like the first 5 mintues u play it then it just dies and ur just killing ppl with no towns to hold or mines to increase your income and apperantly have 99 marksmenship seems to be worst then a person with 50
negative,"Boring.... really boring: Nicely photographed. That's the end of the good news. Absolutely dreadful script. The main characters stumble around in a stupor and mumble... scene after scene, after scene. After an hour or so it really gets old. Before buying this film I looked over the customer reviews and saw some people loved it an some people hated it. I had to see for myself. I quickly sided with the people who hated it. Maybe you need to see for yourself and decide."
negative,"BS Detector Hits ""11"": Just finished watching this for the 3rd time in the last 15+years or so. I try to give LTIP another chance every severalyears or so, hoping that something in me has changed or maturedso that I ""get it"" a bit better. Well, I haven't or can't. It still seems like an indulgent, boring mess. Yes, Brando can act.Yes, Maria Schneider has a fantastic 20-year old body. What does it all add up to? Nothing! A 2 hour waste of time. A movie with a totally emoty story and emotional core. I like a lot of stufffrom the late '60s and early '70s, but if sitting through tedium like this in the name of art was indicative of the era - thankGod we've moved on. Oh, and congratulations to the otherwise usually excellent Bertolucci and Starraro for accomplishing the impossible and making Paris look ugly."
positive,"One of Amy's best pop albums...: This is a sad and thoughtful album, indeed, and Amy writes one of the saddest songs on this album (Missing you). Many of the songs are about unrequited love, marriage, and hardships in life. This album def. reflects Amy's feelings on her marriage to Gary Chapman, and her love for Vince Gill. It is a beautiful, heartfelt album from a beautiful singer. Buy it if you like Amy's previous pop albums, or if you like sad songs (Which I do!)Choice tracks:Nobody homeCry a river,Leave it all behind,Missing you,The feeling that I had,Somewhere down the road."
positive,"Yours Until Dawn: This is a very enjoyable book. Its written in that old 1800's english langauge which is lovely. The main character is wounded in war time and rejected by his fiance. That same woman who is unable to face him scarred and blinded takes on another identity to nurse him back to health. Once she suceeds and gets him mentally and physically healthy she disappears and reappears as his long lost fiance. Gabriel realizes that the two women he loves are the same woman. Cecily explains to Gabriel why she told so many lies and they admit how much they love each other. Its really lovely. I don't like the lies but, she was afraid to admit the truth to him. It makes sense in a weird sort of way."
negative,"Don't Be Fooled By the TRACK LIST!: If you are REALLY in love with a specific song on this soundtrack, like the LOBO song for example, make sure you know what is REALLY on the CD before you order. This track list is not exactly accurate!"
positive,"A great game for families with young kids: This game basically combines the games Memory (where you turn over tiles to make matches) with Clue. The production value is low, but the game play is good and the artwork and theme are fun. Makes me want to try other games by Family Pastimes."
positive,"This book saved my life: If anyone is going through the hell of being stalked, or even think they are being stalked, they MUST by Detective Proctor's book ""How to Stop A Stalker""I have read other ""stalking"" books, and they have been helpful, but none to the extent of Detective Proctor's book.The information, the suggestions, everything is a MUST for someone being stalked.He UNDERSTANDS, something that I didn't feel from the other stalking books.Detective Proctor knows the reality and horror of stalking in an easy read and extremely informative book.This book is up to date (unlike some of the other Stalking books) and my only problem is that he doesn't have a sequel. Hopefully that is something he is working on.I give this book ten stars. This book literally saved my life and it can save yours.If you, a friend, or a family member are being stalked, you must read this book."
positive,Ricky Martin is the best: Ricky Martin is the best don't ... Ricky has a great voice and his songs are very well written. And he's very handsome too!
negative,"Nice sound, poor construction.: I got these last December-05. The molded plastic that holds the ear cups onto the headband started to crack (right at the L/R labels). They eventually crumbled and fractured, causing the cups to fall off. I taped one side up and the other failed as well. I have no doubt that if I replace these, the same thing will happen. My complaint is for $300 I expect something other than soft plastic holding these together at the stress points."
negative,"A classic fantasy, and the greast tale ever.: A story that will leave you speechless.Bilbo Baggins will make you beleve in magic again. A fine prequel to the Lord of the Rings."
positive,Wonderful: Great tale to re-read and enjoyed reading it to my children. Helps get a child's imagination to work harder than they imagined
negative,This Book Sucks!!!!!: This has to be the most boring book I've read in my life. I had to read this book as a requirement for my school and let me tell you i failed the test miserably. This book was so horrible. I didn't understand it because it wasn't clear writing. I'd advise anyone to not read it but if you have to I feel for you.
positive,"touching: What can one say about Neil Young? He has gone down the highway in the slow lane, the passing lane and sometimes in the ditch but he always writes what he FEELS. That is what makes him so GREAT. The new album is very touching. I laugh, He was the King, I cry, When God made me, I reflect,This old guitar. There is not a bad song in the lot. Of course there are those that think differently but Neil does what he does and THAT is what makes him who he is. Sure, he's run the gamut of weirdness: TRANS comes to mind, but to me that was really pretty good altho the concert itself was strange. Does one want to relax and reflect on ones life? Then this is the album for you. His voice does crack just a little, but again, he's NEIL YOUNG. Yes I am a HUGE fan 35 plus years I have listened to Neil. Have ALL of his albums/CDs. This one rates at the, if not the, very top of his music. I don't think you'll be disappointed. LONG MAY YOU RUN"
positive,Great Product from Tivo: I would definately recommend this product to anyone with a Tivo set who wants to use their broadband instead of a phone line to update Tivo. It was very easy to install. Took me about 10 minutes and I was up and running. I've had it for a couple of months now and never had any problems. It always stays connected.
negative,"no: this movie was absolutely terrible... you should not watch it, its really not worth your time. instead of adding an interesting twist, the ""imaginary"" aspects of the film are both absurd and ridiculously literal/unnecessary. i strongly recommend not buying, renting, or even watching this movie."
negative,"I want the last 96 minutes of my life back: This movie is horrible. Don't waste your money buying it or even renting it. COme on, 5 minutes of him staring at something, doing nothing? Or 5 minutes of watching the grass blowing in the wind? Art or not, it sucked horribly."
negative,"Great story: This story was meant to be Jean Giono's gift to the world, but the publishers took over to make money. There are certain places on the web where you can still access this wonderful story the way in which the author intended."
positive,"FIVE STAR CAMERA!: This is my first SLR camera... so I won't be able to compare this camera with other SLR camera. But I am able to say that if you were to buy a camera this would be a great choice. The quality of the Picture is much greater than point and shoot. You have more control on how your pictures turn out. The Minolta HTsi plus is easy to use for the basic features, but if you want to use the advance feature.... reading the manuel is recommended, but don't worry. ( )Pros: Design, and easy to use.Cons: Can't print date on pictures."
positive,"Great Book- I couldn't live without it.: This is one of the best books I've ever read. my best friend told me about it, promising to bring it to school soon, and that night my mom broght home the second book from the library. Now me, my best friend and another friend are totally obsesed with these books. I'm waiting for the sixth one to arrive.The story is about how Rusty, a ordinary house cat goes out into the woods one night and meets a cat from ThunderClan, Later joining ThunderClan and getting a new name (Firepaw). Inside the clan, deadly secrets are kept hidden by one of Firepaw's best friends. Outside, a Mean and horrid leader from a different Clan drives out yet another Clan(and there's one more Clan, too!).I won't say anything else, as not to ruin the plot, but I will say this: This is a great book. I advise it to anyone who likes cats and/or fantasy."
positive,"book from the past.: I purchased this book because I remembered I read it as a young child. I still love the pictures and the characters but I do have to agree with alot of other reiews that this book is not appropriate for children. The story is dark (a child who's left alone with no explaination of why ), spanking is used as a form of punishment, and the idea of strangers taking over a child's welfare is creepy. I love the book for the pictures and the layout. I suggest buying this book but not giving it to a young child."
negative,"THIS IS NOT WATERPROOF!: I bought two bottles of this product for ink and watercolor sketching based on the description on this page,and paid to have them delivered overnight for an impending trip. They arrived, and the ink is DEFINITELY not waterproof--certainly not suitable for taking a watercolor wash over the lines. Disappointing, to say the least. I'm told Noodler's Lexington Gray is a good waterproof choice for sketching, but haven't tried it yet."
negative,"WARNING: Here there be monologue.: Lawhead is, unfortunately, a very inconsistent writer. Sections of each book in this trilogy are excellent and quite enjoyable. However, there are longer portions that are awkward and tedious. The writer also commits a number of literary sins that drag the whole down. In the first book, there is the character of the professor. He is quite flat and is what is known as ""the author's mouthpiece""--a set-piece device used to conveniently convey information that the author has trouble working in otherwise. The professor has at least a couple long monologues that reek of the above device.Although there are worthwhile sections, I recommend you avoid this title and pick up something better."
positive,"My go-to cookie book: This is the first cookbook I bought, for Christmas baking in 1978, right out of college. I use it all of the time, and bake dozens of cookies out of it for Christmas gifts every year. If you like to bake cookies, this is where to learn."
positive,"Asimov's early work his best: The best example around of Asimov's work. It is intellectual, interesting, and just plain entertaining. reading it, you can feel the danger that the fledgeling Foundation is in when threatened by its aggeressive neighbors and there are unconventional solutions. I have only two complaints. The book is dated and there is little action. Get past those and you're sure to enjoy the book."
negative,"A little disappointing: I wasn't too happy when I got this book in the mail. It simply does not have very much material, even for a baby. All my granddaughters teach their children simple signing starting at a few months and pre-verbal signing is great for eliminating much of the frustration of not being able to express themselves, but it seems to me that the pictures in this book would be difficult for them to catch on to. Obviously, the adult would need to teach the signs but I don't think they would be able to recognize them from the pictures after they learned them."
negative,"A trick, no treats!: No Michael Myers, No point!This film is totally oblivious to the original series as this should not really be titled as a halloween sequel. It may have worked better if it had just been called SEASON OF THE WITCH minus the halloween 3 title. I'm collecting all the halloween films, but I will leave this one out. Very unimpressive. Fans will be dissapointed."
negative,LINE OF BEAUTY IS NOT BEAUTIFUL: WAY TO MANY EXPLICIT GAY LOVE SCENES IN FAIRNESS I DO NOT LIKE TO READ EXPLICIT SEX AND THIS WAS X RATED
negative,"Dissapointing in all but a few areas.: I ordered this book becuase it was the first available on Server+ but I wish I had waited. The book itself is all jumbled up with no coherence to the layout. If all of the needed information is included (which I doubt) finding some of it is difficult or impossible. Some of the authors anecdotes are completely unnecessary and the inclusion of a 70+ page glossary seems like overkill in a book of only 680 pages.Much of the information is very A+ esq and the coverage of network cards seems way too high. That said, the questions in the book do seem to match the CompTIA obejectives - I just have a feeling that if you are taking the test you would be better off with another book or a different resource.One other thing, the author information does not say he is Server+ certified which makes you wonder."
positive,"Addictive Fun: This is a very fun game to play.You can eat,socialize with other sims,use the bathroom,watch tv....there is so much you can do.This is the first Sims game I ever bought and I absolutley love it.Since I am new to the series,I am gonna check out more of these Sims games."
positive,Great Resource: This is a great resource for a new or experienced dog owner. Well written with great illustrations that show all aspects of the breed!
positive,"Opposing View of Divorce: The heart break and loss from a womans point of view,abused by the court system, robbed of her hard earned home and possessons to a new and very different life in a strange country and different culture. Ms. Lanes best effort in an attention holding and often surprising, recovery. Beautiful scenery and superior directing make this one of movie lands best kept secrets."
negative,"disappointing: I have never seen the American version, but I loved the original British ""Queer as Folk"". It was funny and real. I didn't just believe in these characters, I felt like I knew them. Series 2 is more than a disappointment, it is almost a betrayal. It is not just that the action seems contrived, but so do the characters. I couldn't believe a minute of it. If you were a fan of series 1 you will probably have to see series 2, maybe with lowered expectations you will enjoy it more than I did."
negative,"...: Well, I just bought myself Transformers on DVD. Giggling like an idiot and running to my DVD player I was absolutley shocked when I threw it in. No extras whatsoever. Not even a theatrical trailer. Pan and Scan only ?!?!! Augh! Could it get any worse? Yep. The sound is horrible. Hissy and muted. The Video isn't incredible, either. on Par with the VHS copy. Perhaps slightly crisper. I'm not sure if I got a different version. It has a different cover than what's shown here on Amazon (I bought mine at a local video store) This version is released by a company called Seville and Sports a cover like the VHS Release froma few years back with Optimus. Needless to say. I was incredibly dissapointed. Disgusted, even."
negative,"It may be a good product, but Verizon made it junk: I bought this unit to replace a unit sold to me by the phone company. It was to be ""combatable"" to DSL Verizon. Not so said the phone company. You have to by from us, they said. I battled this unit for a month. It changed my IP so many times and would lock up. Customer service from Zoom was as bad as Verizon. One would say, ""Its the phone company's problem"", then the phone company would say, ""Its the modem company's problem"". I was given a modem from a friend that had a wireless modem from a different phone system. It works great. Buyer beware. It does not work as advertised."
positive,"One of my favorite books: I love historical fiction and was unsure of how I'd like this book when it was recommended to me. I wasn't too familiar with the Old Testament story that this book is about, but this novel really made it come to live. I love Lynn Austin's writing style and have since read many more of her books. This book, though, is the cream of the crop. I loved the characters, the setting, and how the plots interwove together. I've read this a few times since I first read it and it's always as good as the first time."
positive,Great buy!: My son wanted Lincoln Logs but I could not see paying that much. The Frontier Logs were a great buy! I got more logs for a lower price.
positive,Thought provoking: When i started this book i had no idea that it would lead me to read the next four. two thumbs up.
negative,"Not her best work.: My 18 month daughter absolutely loves the Going to Bed Book, she asks us to read it over and over again. Unfortunately this box set does not compare. The illustrations are not nearly as clever, the text is not as rhythmic. I wish I would have gone to the bookstore to check it out first."
positive,One of the best albums ever: The Black Keys are one of the best bands around today. This album is great from start to finish. You will not be disappointed. I saw them in concert and they are just as great live as they are on CD. If you are interested in good old bluesy rock then this band is for you.
positive,Nice compression shirt...runs small...: like the other reviews state order size bigger...trust me I usually wear XL...I'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice. I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet. SO do order size up.
negative,Featureless DVD: This DVD is a very weak release of a terrific movie. There are no bonus features -- including scenes once broadcast on network television -- and Disney went back and changed some of the animation to sanitize it. Here's a big thumbs down and I hope they re-release it with the original animation and with enough features to make the DVD worth the price.
negative,DO NOT BUY!!!: This product claims to be six canvases but in fact they only send one. IT IS A RIPOFF!! DON'T BUY.
positive,"Does not break.: This is definitely a good cell phone.I have seen all those fancy cell phone with huge screen and photo capabilities, but what's the point? I only want to call people with my phone, and if it does that, I am happy, and this phone does it well and has a good price.I have also dropped this phone about 50 times since I got it 6 monthes ago and not a single thing has gone wrong for the phone as a result of my carelessness.I think this is a perfect phone for someone who wants to keep things simple"
negative,"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: This book was a very poorly written effort in my opinion. Additionally, the author would have you believe that the terriorism that exists today is the fault of the U.S and the protestants that make the U.S. their home. It would seem that the author alines himself with Osama Bin Laden and those who wish to control the middle east. It's hard for me to imagine that this man is a professor at Columbia University. Instead of wasting his time here, he needs to return to his own country for the purpose of educating his own people."
negative,"SLOW very very slow: Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on. The only song information I could get was ""information unavaiable check back in 24 hours"". They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours. This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours. So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site. Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker."
negative,Absolute Rubbish: On behalf of Randy-Paula and the producers of american Idol I humbly apologize for besieging America with this crap.
positive,"Not the typical teenage horror movie...: This movie doesnt have all of the blood and gore, but it does have suspense. It has a few surprises and the ending comes out great. This is one of those all-of-the-pieces-come-together kind of films. It has good characters and not too many to get confused. The plot is well put together. It is a good movie to watch, although it is not the best horror film ever made. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but I think that there is just something missing to make it a five star movie."
negative,Not worth the money: The instructions are the worst I have ever seen! Right now I cannot tell if the d@#$ thing is even cooking rice! Buy one of the cheaper cookers and save yourself a lot of headaches!
positive,"a milestone in a beautifull singer's career!: When I listened to ""FAITH"" the first time,I did not hesitate to order the two previous albums as well! Beautifull songs from a damn' good looking young woman. Every song will touch you in a different manner. Who needs Shania Twain ? We have Faith Hill!! Go ahead,Faith!"
negative,"Blank- Man Begins: Batman Begins would've been a better movie had it been it's own original character. Although comical at times and the constant changing lead actors playing Batman (i.e. Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer & George Clooney), the consistency was there. Batman Begins and doesn't quite offer an insight as to what you're watching. Is he in Tibet? Okay, halfway in you find out why he was locked up. Batman Begins tried to be darker than it was. The unimpressive BatMobile (Hummer, dune buggie dragster fusion). Maybe the new generation of kids will enjoy this. But as a new twist on Batman, 2 stars. As a standalone hero, Begins would deserve maybe 4 stars."
negative,"WARNING: ARGENTO, ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL: This film lacks all the elements that make Argento's movies great and fun to watch. There's no memorable music; no fantastic use of color; and no likeable characters. The holes in the plot are unforgiveable and the story-line is infantile. The plot twists are predictable and almost laughable. This is simply a sorry excuse for an Argento film. I just hope that He'll make-up for it on his next project."
negative,"This is not Pratchett: This is a strange book, quite good, but it reads like well-informed fan fiction, not at all like Terry Pratchett himself (i have read all of the Discworld series, some titles several times over).The style is dry, the characters non-developed, the pacing and structure do not have the same feel as other works, and it lots of ways this story is flavorless.It doesn't feel right...."
negative,"Worst Product I have ever got from Amazon: The product link says the cable is detachable from the computer end to the brick, not true. It says it has an LED to show when it is charging, not true. It says it is for a PowerBook G4, not true (From the start I had to twist it to get it to tell my computer not charging. it doesn't have the power to charge). I returned the first one to get what was listed but Amazon sent the same thing out. I couldn't be bothered so I just stuck it in the corner.DO NOT GET IT, its too overpriced and doesn't do what it says. PRODUCT INFO IS FALSE!"
positive,The River Between by Ngugi Wa Thiongo (available from Amazon): The River Between by Ngugi Wa Thiongo is a very interesting novel. The author gives us a good picture of the Kenyans' cultural beliefs and their reactions to Europeans settling on land that had been theirs for centuries. We learn about the myths that govern the Kenyan culture. Our protagonist is very engaging. The book is intense and fairly short.E.J. Dunne
negative,"Trash: Infantile depiction of politics, sex, and Panama itself. Insulting screenplay for the viewer. The movie is pure bravado and seems made-up on the fly. No sense of understanding for the people or politics of Panama. Shockingly bad."
negative,"Worst movie I've ever seen: I seen this movie because a Halloween all nighter wason a feseveral years ago and I have to say this is theworst movie I've ever seen. The plot is dreaful... Somerich dude is trying to kill kids by selling masks thatmelt thier faces as they watch some lame TV program.How dumb is that?Then we have Tom Atkins the big hero. What???? You meanthis is the guy we are supposed to root for? Somepersonality less old man that honestly isn't much of ahero is all. In fact, he shouldn't have been in a movieanyway. If John Carpenter was just trying to take thisseries in a different direction he went all wrong aboutit. Sure the Michael Myers series really wasn't all thatgreat, but it wasn't bad enough to have the series turnedlike this. What a horrible movie!"
negative,"Seems to have no point. Don't waste your time.: Allowing for the possibility that I am just too dense to understand it, this seems as pointless as it is boring. With the same repetitive scenes that make little if any point the first time, any more than the rest. Certainly not plausible, even for fiction, this is bizarre film of a crew that takes a cruise on a small boat, capsizes in the Bermuda Triangle, its passengers rescued by a passenger ship without passengers or crew. One of the woman keeps reappearing, after being killed over and over again, frequently by herself (a double, triple, etc.) I watched this my wife who agreed with this. Even the genre is not clear -- not exactly a horror film; certainly not a mystery, except for the mystery of why it was even made. Don't waste your time or money."
negative,"wrong item: I was going to get a book with a ISN number of 0072316373...But today, I got one with 0070412901...So I need you send my money beac to my account, and give me a well reason why you let the seller mail me a totally different book again, It is the second time I get an item with wrong number"
negative,"10 Short Months and My Keurig is Already Dead!: How frustrating! I used it without problem for the entire 10 months. Then all of a sudden this morning, I brew one cup of coffee and it was apparently its last. It's just dead. No error message, no weird noises. Just a dead, blank screen. I had such high hopes mine would be the exception. But no. I hesitate to get another one, but it's just so darn convenient. If anyone has tried the Tassimo as a replacement to the Keurig--is it any better?"
negative,"Anecdotes: I gave this book TWO stars instead of ONE because of the included anecdotes about patients of the authors.Save your money, and read this review instead of buying the book:Boys have feelings, not just girls.Boys are just as sensitive as girls.Listen to your son and he'll be emotionally healthy.Boys are special because they have lots of energy.Nope...nothing about your son being gay, if that's what you're looking for.I just listed those four things off the top of my head without even thinking about the book. As I read over what I wrote, I see that my blind guesses were right: That's pretty much what the book says in its 250 + pages."
negative,"This book is overrated!: I ain't trying to hate or anything but I didnt like Casting the First Stone by Kimberla Lawson Roby. I thought the soap opera plot was built upon stereotypes of the one dimensional characters who I found completely lacking in depth. I disliked it so much that I was completely turned off by the idea of attempting to read the sequel Too Much of a Good Thing, even after I read the preview online on the authors website. I kept thinking to myself ""hasnt this negro(Curtis Black) learned anything."""
positive,"Grew on me.: This album has more of a country feel than the older ones. I was not that into it at first, most musically and lyrically (Which is really Bright Eyes' strong point)....but I have to say, after awhile, it grew on me. Now I like it quite a bit for background. I must say though that I love it much more than the solo Conor Oberst album."
negative,"Looooooooooooooooong.: If you can read and readily understand old-english, you *may* be able to enjoy this novel.I found it painfully long and didn't even care to finish it, which is unheard of for me!"
positive,"I loved/hated it: Oh how I wanted to hate this. It's racist, sexist, rude and absurd. But man oh man could Chandler write. He dragged me down into the seedier side of 1940 Los Angeles, and I couldn't get out until he let me go at the end of the book. The plot? Not so much to it in the end, really. Just a basic hunt for a killer who hunted for the girl he once loved. The twists and turns along the way just provided excuses for more wallowing in the seamy side of life--decadent rich, smelly poor, liars, cheats, and killers. If you asked me, I'd say it wasn't my cup of tea. But the man could describe everything from people to houses to a crawling pink bug in a way that kept me mesmerized. Read this if you want to know what hard-boiled is supposed to sound like."
positive,"Transformers: This movie is a simply an action movie. It has the explosions, the cars, and the drama of an action movie and not much else. But then again, how much more do you need for a entertaining movie? With the level of graphics, a blu-ray is especially nice."
negative,"don't buy the dvd: all the dvd is, is the vhs version with the top and bottom cut off on the screen.i rented the vhs and dvd together one day and found once you get passed the widescreen intro that the vhs version actually shows more of the movie. the dvd is the full screen version with the top and bottom removed!this is ridiculous. go rent it yourself and see."
negative,"Too scattered, too shallow: Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated; for example, there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot-matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation. For some unclear reason, two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing. If you are actually involved in technical writing, there are better books."
positive,Waited too long to buy one!: The best rice we've ever made. All claims provided by Cooks Illustrated are true. Excellant product that is so easy to use!
negative,"Completely silly: Charen sure has lots of footnotes - I just noticed 5 of them in one paragraph on a page - but it's still hard to take her seriously when she suggests things such as her claim that Democrats are trying to make African Americans feel targetted and despised.I'm not sure which is wackier: That blacks NEED a political party to tell them that some folks discriminate against them? Or that Democrats have some kind of organized Master Plan to keep blacks voting for them by making them THINK they are discriminated against.She even blames liberals for homelessness, which is just too absurd to even comment on. Does Penguin Group not have any writers out there who are more worthy of being published than someone who makes such crazy, silly claims just to get her 15 minutes of fame?"
positive,"Best Cookbook I Own, and I Own Many: I bought this book last year, and have used it over and over. I am not the most enthusiastic chef, but this book helps a lot. Dishes are not overly complicated, or time consuming, yet are healthy and filling. Most importantly, they are almost all delicious. My husband is thrilled that I bought this book, for now he gets to eat well prepared meals often, and lose weight to boot."
positive,"rooted in New England: These poems seem firmly rooted in New England and seem to be timeless, though decidedly pre-modern feel to them (this was originally published in 1916). Some of these poems may seem familiar ... ""The road not taken"" is popular at high school graduations. There are poems of nature such as The Oven Bird (""There is a singer everyone has heard,/ Load, a mid-summer and mid-wood bird,"") or ""Birches (""and they seem not to break; though once they are bowed/ for low for long, they never right themselves"") but with wider significance. There are also poems of rural isolation such as ""The Hill Wife"" and ""Snow"". His poetry plays by literary and poetic rules, and may not be simple to read, but he does not oversimplify life."
positive,"Stellar voices performing a Rodgers & Hammerstein classic: This stellar cast of wonderful singers/musical theater actors show off the beautiful, magnificent score of Rodgers and Hammerstein's King and I. With Julie Andrews playing Anna, Lea Salonga and Peabo Bryson playing the doomed lovers and American mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne guesting to sing ""Something Wonderful"", the musical was brought to great heights while making us more understanding of the Asian culture interspersing with the Western ways. The musical is worth getting just because of the duets of Salonga - Bryson. Andrews' singing is an added ingredient to this recording."
negative,"His age is no excuse...: To be honest, criticisms of this book have already been voiced a hundred times before, and better than I could say. Derivative, unashamedly cliched and dull...sadly, it's all true. But one thing that keeps popping is the author's age. The fact is that blaming the poor quality of the writing on his youth is a bit of a cop out. If you can write well, you can write well no matter how old you are. Sure, you improve as you go along, but a novice writer who starts at the age of 30 can be just as bad as a novice who starts at 13. Don't give this kid the excuse; talent shows at any age, and he has very little."
negative,Not so Hotline to Murder!: I thought this was written by an inexperienced mystery writer. Not suspenseful or even very special in writing style. Very humdrum.
negative,"Too Long and Dull: This book started off ok. I mean there was a good intro but after that nothing seemed to happen. Dont get me wrong, there were like two scenes of action but they were really short and lasted maybee a page. And it was a long book so there were huge spaces in the book where nothing happened."
negative,"A disappointment.: Even though I ended up bottle feeding, I did try breastfeeding while using this pillow. I am not a huge person, but a little larger than average, and this pillow just DID NOT work for me. I tried it every which way I could, and no such luck.My son enjoys it as much as a 3.5 month old can. Even though it clearly tags the product to not use for a sleeping infant, it saved me at times when his reflux was especially bad.If you are a size 14+ you will want to look into a pillow that will fit you better, because most likely, this one will not be as helpful as it is for smaller women."
negative,Diapers had strange stain: Some of the diapers in the box had a strange stain on them! Had to throw them out. What a waste. LM for Amazon to provide a refund.
negative,Basic labels: I purchased this to create labels for gifts. I found it easier to create the labels with the templates that come with the labels (Avery). So I'm not using this product at all.It might be ok for DVD labels. I didn't try that.
positive,stainless steel frothing cup: This item is just what I needed for our new espresso machine. The item is nice and large enough to froth milk without making a mess.
positive,What could be great is only good.: This could have been excellent but Eddie Kramer edits out the second guitar and the percussion.Also two tunes missing--tunes that appear nowhere else.In order to further the Hendrix legend(as if there is a need) Kramer cheats us.Typical music business B.S. Too bad--this could have been something awesome.Remember you are NOT hearing the true show--what a bummer!!!
negative,"Not a fan.: This textbook is boring and more about other people's experience than actually explaining Hospitality Information Systems. While beneficial, too much reading about other people's lives gets old real fast."
positive,Garmin Zumo: Looks Great and works great but do not purchase for the XM radio feature.The Manual is very sketchy about the radio and you have to purchase a 300 dollar antenna to make it work and no other details about the quality of the radio. Other than the XM the Zumo's displays and ease of operating is execlent.
negative,"Dumb...: I just saw this movie last night and It amazes me that The Mummy Returns made as much money as it did in the box office. I believe the theaters should have pad us to see this one. The first Mummy was OK, but not great. I would have given it two stars at the most. But this one only gets one, and that's because I had to put a star up there. If I had a the option it would have got a big fat goose egg. If you plan on buying The Mummy Returns... please return it."
negative,Get another one!!!: The poles bent when I was putting it together. I have since seen tents that are easier to put together with one pull of a string. This is easy to store in the bag they give you. But I wouldn't recommend this product.
negative,Really aweful movie!: Extremely boring with a very weak storyline. This is compounded by the fact that it is very poorly executed. You will start snoring after the first 10 minutes as you realize that there is no character development at all! This movie was so aweful it put me off from seeing other movies for a week...it was that bad! Minus 2 stars!
negative,"Wasn't horrible, but still a let down: I love to cook, and I'm also almost 30, so when I picked this book up at a bookstore at Grand Central Station a couple of months back, I was excited to read it. I read the first chapter and wasn't impressed, so I didn't come back to it for months, until I finally broke down and finished it last weekend amongst laundry loads.Like the other reviewers, I found the book to be very little about cooking, and more about a rather immature perspective on what seems to be a life with little to complain about. I didn't get the impression that Julie even LIKED to cook, so that kinda bothered me, since I thought it would be more of a celebration. She frankly struck me as someone with too much time on her hands who took on the ""Project"" merely for something to do.It was ok, and an easy read, but very self-indulgent and precocious."
positive,"The best racing game that doesn't have a nude for a mascot!: Don't listen to the cons up there, this game has great graphics, long levels, tons of secrets, and great background music. And if you don't want to race, you can play the totally exellent stunt level!"
positive,Loads of fun!: My 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game. Has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade. You get to design a float and it just endless fun! Graphics and animation are very colorful and cute. It's a winner!
positive,"Dance, sing, and tap: My two-year-old loves this CD, asking for it every day, and I'm happy to play it for her. There's only one song that I find annoying. On the whole it's a good variety of easily singable songs and exercises to teach ear training. This Drum Song Collection focuses on drum accompaniments, but uses other instruments as well. We're enjoying it."
negative,"the main seam was separated: after i recieved the product, the main seam was seperated on the ball, the little colored lenses were rattleing around inside the ball.. took some time to fish them out of the ball.... so yeah it was defenatly broken when i got it.."
positive,"Master Story Teller: This is the first Rick Bass book I have read, I will now buy everything he has ever written, he is that good. For those of us who don't need murder and mayhem in every book or movie, Rick Bass offers stories which will stay with you for a lifetime."
positive,"Interesting book, but some problems: I think April Morning is an interesting book. It really lets you see what people might have been thinking during the battle of Lexington and Concord. It should be read along with the 8th grade history book in history class when we learn about the Revolutionary War. It would make the class much more interesting, and then we could compare the information in April Morning to what our history book says. However, sometimes there were too many details about the battle scenes and the language used in the book disturbed some people I know. Smile! :0) :0) :0)"
positive,"Another amazing season of Weeds!: I won't say too much, because not much needs to be said. If you have loved any of the previous seasons of Weeds, you will love this one, too. It changes perspective a little, as they are no longer in the suburbs, but the social commentary follows them to their new home. If you've never seen this show, you need to. If you've seen it, you should own every season on DVD, including this one!"
negative,"Not as expected.: This movie has the same characters as the show, but it just didn't seem the same. It's very long, which usually doesn't agree with the targeted audience's short attention span. I didn't find this nearly as enjoyable as the TV show, and my son didn't watch it much while it was playing."
positive,"Excellente: Though I don't work in an office environment, I still have to put up with idiots everyday. This movie is right up my alley. This movie plays on current stereotypes and cubicle horror stories to make you laugh until you wet yourself (and I almost did). I bought this movie for my father as a birthday present becasue he does slave away in a cubicle and hates his idiot boss. However, amidst all the coffee and desperation, most of the jokes could be expected a mile away, but that didn't stop me from watching it again and again."
negative,"Broadway Clay: I still do not understand how this guy is getting more attention than the winner of AI, but that said, how can anyone listen to this CD and not think that he has a voice for Broadway and only Broadway. He punctuates every single syllable, lighten up Clay!The music on the CD is catchy, but the voice behind the music is just plain annoying."
negative,"What a load of c***!: I never read the book, but the CD is such a masterfully ""abridged"" version of the book that it manages to tell you for hour HOW WONDERFUL six sigma is, while totally neglecting to tell you WHAT SIX SIGMA ACTUALLY IS, or HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED. In short, the CD contains nothing but self-marketing bull. If you have money to waste, go buy it."
positive,A great series and great movies: I liked this one better than the first movie about Ori. I think that anyone who liked the series should get it. I haven't seen the extras yet but will as soon as I can.
positive,Love these puzzles: I have purchased several M&D puzzles for my 3 year old granddaughter and she loves putting them together. Very durable and colors are so vibrant.
negative,"Although to call it garbage is a bit harsh: Songwriting lacks creativity, almost all straight major chords. Singer has good voice. There's much better electronica available."
negative,"incomplete: I need nutrients as well as calories, protein, carbs, sodium, fiber, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and %fat calories. This book does not cover nutrients."
positive,"A Clockwork Orange: Novelist Anthony Burgess is obviously a wordsmith of the highest order, and director Stanley Kubrick was able to share that in the dialogue and especially the narrative. The film is itself is one of the most clever and perceptive I've seen, with a sardonic wit, and a sense of irony so sharp it almost hurts. Shockingly violent visuals. Psychedelica gone amok which you must love. This 1971 vision of the world in and my 2005 vision of the world are identical. If you've never seen it, go get it right now.It's very hard to believe this film is 34 years old. It's too damn modern. I'd really hate to be Kubrick 30 years after this film, probably knowing he'll never top it.Malcolm McDowell. I suppose that, for many folks, he'll go down in cinematic history as the guy who killed Captain Kirk. I'd like to humbly suggest that McDowell watch this film so he can remember that, once upon a time, he was a damn fine actor."
positive,Great: The book was in great condition I just didn't realize it wasn't the book with the foot notes....But service was great!
negative,"DODGY GEEZER WITH BIG EARS: This sucks really badly.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!it has will Smith in it. Enough said.But, saying that I haven't explained yet.He has ears that are on the same scale to Tom Cruise's nose, and my pal AJ""Jizzy B"" 's enormous girth. I said to AJ ""Dude! Sweet! Dude! I wonder if we can get satellite T.V. for free if we splice a wire into those things?"" He reckoned we could, so we did, but the wire was really short, so that's why he looks so angry on the cover of the DVD, cos he's dragging the wall of my house round with him, but he can't figure out what's going on ; he's like: ""Dude, why's that wall following me around? That must have been one bad trip.""So the film sucks as it cost me a wall of a house, which promptly fell down, and also you can't see half the cast cos of Smith's ears, but it got one star as I got free satellite T.V.!!! WHOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!"
negative,"Not Stable: The 2.0"" Receiver Stabilization Assy' is cheap and does not keep the rack and or the bikes stable."
positive,"Plug-n-play, works like a charm: I bought this because I didn't want to fiddle around with uncompatible third party wifi adapters. It plugs-n-plays and configures easily. I was up and running with my Tivo in 5 minutes. I also want to complement Amazon. The first shipment was stolen from my front porch, Amazon sent another one no questions asked. $40+free priority shipping+no tax is a Win in my books!"
positive,"I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!: FINALLY!! A REAL historian who writes from a position of sympathy towards modern witches and pagans while unceremoniously debunking most all of the pet fantasies held by many feminist oriented authors today. Of course, I don't agree with ALL of what he says here, but boy did he ever open a can of worms and make me think! I am so glad this book is out there and hope that it finds its way into the syllabus of some of the Christian colleges. I know....but we can hope, right?"
positive,"good book: When I say a good book, I mean one that keeps your interest. A sad story, probable a little over done on the actions for the white people, but one that makes you realize what racism does in a nation. Its hard to believe how we humans can treat each other."
negative,Not really an uplifting movie: Poorly filmed and bad acting is the best way to describe this B movie. I would avoid it if you can.
negative,"Go with pampers swaddlers: I bought these thinking that there couldnt be that much of a difference between pampers and pampers swaddlers. I was wrong. The diapers just feel very cheaply made, the outside is a different material that is rough and the diapers seem to swallow up my 10lb baby. As for absorbancy, they are ok, better than the huggies and so far no accidents up the back, but I will not buy them again."
positive,good: good why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is good. strange.
negative,"Extremely Juvenile: While reading this book I continuously kept thinking I must have picked it up in the tween section of the library. Pretty much everything about this book is foolishly unrealistic and completely childish. I actually had a bigger problem with Lottie than I did w/ Hayden. No 20 year old woman living in that time period would have behaved in the way she did. She was idiotic. So was her friend, Harriet, who chased her to Cornwall and became a servant in her home instead of asking to see her and ask to stay there. Even the way they collected cats was weird. This book is just plain dumb. Everything is cliche, drawn out, boring and while I did enjoy the 2 love scenes in the book, they are near the end and it's just not nearly enough to save this mess of a story. I whole heartedly recommend skipping ""One Night of Scandal""."
negative,"Riding High Livin' Free by Ralph Sonny Barger Amazon Kindle Version.: Found the chosen story lines disappointing. The booked lacked reader appeal for me, hence I was not compelled to return tothe book after several chapters had been read."
positive,"great bed time toy: my infant loves this toy!! everynight i use it to put her to sleep. she loves looking at the soft lights and listening to the music. i read several reviews of people saying they were upset because the music only lasted for five min, and that was not long enough to put baby to sleep! however it will play for longer!!up to ten minutes(it depends on what setting you put it on)if you read the manual , i believe it is the setting for lights and music only. and so far ten min has been plenty of time for my little one to fall asleep!! its drifts her off right into a trance!!"
negative,"A High School Senior's Review...: Like many other reviewers, I read this book because it is a requirement in many English classes. Although the plot becomes interesting at times, the majority of it is filler. The book is filled with pointless characters and chapters devoted to run-ons of Pip's thoughts.Because the book was written so long ago, it is also very difficult to connect with. The character relationships are annoying. The romance between Pip and Estella becomes very hard to believe, because Estella is not a likable person. And the dialect is very unbelievable. It is hard to picture someone using Joe's speech patterns, even in old English times.While there are probably many people who will enjoy this novel, I would not suggest this book to someone looking for a quick read (meaning high school students). It is very difficult to skim and requires alot of time to appreciate. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you enjoy long, character developing novels this book may be for you."
positive,"a voice unsurpassed: This CD is stunning. I am a cellist, and I originally bought it for some of the Bach pieces that featured prominent instrumental parts, but from the start, I was spellbound. The first selection, BWV 82A, is one of the most beautiful works of Bach that I have ever heard. Ian Bostridge's voice is spellbinding. I am looking forward to hearing much more, especially his lieder CDs."
positive,"i loved this book and it was funny as well as informative: I am 13, and I first read this book when I was 11 and just finished re-reading it for about the 8th time or so. This is such a great book! It is about a motion study expert and a psychiatrist who marry and plan to have 6 boys and 6 girls, which they do: Anne, Mary, Ernestine, Martha, Frank Jr, Bill, Lill, Fred, Dan, John, Bob, and Jane. They each have their own adventures; Anne with having the most resposibility, Ernestine and touch typing and many more funny adventures, all lead by their crowd-loving and humerous father."
negative,"Horrible Film!: This is a horrible film. I expect Lovecraft's work to be modified when translated to the screen, but there was very little left of his original idea in this film. This film is slow, boring, monotonous, and predictable. It was so bad I found myself apologizing to a friend who watched it with me. Very disappointing. By the end, I wanted the characters to die."
negative,A BAD ANIME: I can say that this a bad anime.the animation quality is average and the story is dull from start to finish.There isnt any heat or excitement and it doent have a real ending.
negative,A genuine waste of time: Crude and silly with a plot worthy of 3rd graders but to vulgar for that age group. I suggest you not waste your time or money on this movie.
positive,Read it!: Why are you sitting there? Get up and read this book. It may show you how human you really are...
negative,"Blows!!!: As I write this I'm 48 min. into the movie and i don't know if I'm watching a female version of cliffhanger or a Horror movie. All I have seen is 5 females have a sleepover in a cabin, some woman get stuck and starts to hyperventelate and some woman have a hard to time crossing over a hole. So if your up for watching 5 women having a caving expedition with the usual female driven bickering among each other then i would recommend it but if your looking for horror see Wolf Creek or something. Oh by the way i'm 56 min. into it now and still nothing. Save your money."
negative,"Amazed: I give a one to the writer because they know how to capitalize on their own magical economical development. Amusing. Keep going, there are still new people falling off the tomato truck every day."
negative,"Don't Even Waste Your Time: If you are looking for a book to put you to sleep, look no further. Here it is. This is the most pathetic book I have ever read. And not only was the book boring, the main character, Meursault, was an emotionless, hopless, and disgusting human being. His views on women and relationships are no less than vile. He does not even remorse over the death of his mother. He then says that he no emotional attachment to Marie, the lady that he is sexually active with. Thankfully, he commits a cold blooded murder and is put to death. And at his execution, he says that he wishes there be ""howls of execration."" It is amazing to me that an individual can want there to be people cursing him on the day of his death. Bottom line, this is not woth the time for you to sit down and read it."
positive,"very nice: its a perfume and u get what u smell. was delivered on time and smells as it should smell, what else is there to say."
negative,Bad size: Garmin GPS coverDon't make my error and assume this cover will fit the popular Nuvi series-there are none.
positive,"A must have: This book is a must have for anyone that uses Six Sigma, is learning Six Sigma, or wants to advance their Quality career.This book gives insight into the ""why"". Why Six Sigma is being implemented, Why it's so ""hot"", Why it can turn any company around, and Why it's better than TQM.While the book is mainly aimed at those in leadership positions, I believe that anyone that has a thirst for knowledge on Six Sigma should pick up this book. For those of you who need to implement Six Sigma buy it in conjunction with The Six Sigma Way Team Field Book. Everything you ever wanted to know about Six Sigma can be found in these two books."
negative,"Compatibility issues: It appears that the Netgear MA401 802.11b Wireless PC Card will not work with this network adapter.Belkin's site claims:Q: Can the Wireless PCI Card Adapter be used with any other PCMCIA or CardBus adapter cards?A: No, the Wireless PCI Card Adapter F5D6000 will only work with and was only designed to work with the Wireless Notebook Network Card F5D6020. Using other PCMCIA or CardBus adapter cards will not work."
negative,"a travesty: This film did nothing to portray Audrey in the best light possible. sub-par acting (Natalie Portman was the obvious choice!!!), and the directing was 'off.' Also, that ""moon river"" crooning had to be a JOKE! Buy or rent one of Audrey's REAL films, and you'll be much better off."
negative,"Great story, excellent writing, poorly edited.: Like so many other people who have read Lynn Austin's Gods and Kings, I appreciated her fine writing skills and excellent story telling ability. However, her editors must have struggled with the manuscript translation to ebook style. There were so many lines that did not separate into paragraphs, punctuation problems, words not separated or separated words when not needed, and words run together, that at times it was difficult to read. I can't believe that Bethany House would release a script with this many errors in it. An author of this caliber deserves a better production than this gobblygook."
negative,"Bad Design-: What is Scotts thinking? Cannot hook this piece of junk inline like you could with the older design, and the mixing is now inconsistent - nothing like the older design. Do not waste your time with this- it is a piece of poorly designed junk."
negative,"ho hum....yawn: i heard this cd while hanging out in some cd stores in boulder colorado. over their system it sounded great....kind of a stripped down j.s.blues explosion. i then had several long days of driving to get into it. the more i listened, the less i liked it. now, several months later it never makes it out of my stack of 1500 cds. in fact, i am thinking of moving it to the ever rotating pile of cds to trade. i guarantee that most of you will never listen to this cd more than a year from now....there just isn't enough there to hold one's attention. white guys doing stripped down blues is nothing new or radical or interesting. listen to the originals (hooker, guy, waters, harpo, wells, rev.gary davis, hopkins, wolf....)....they are much more interesting. If white blues is what you crave, search out peter green (hot foot powder) or go for the funkier js blues explosion (completely unlike the other artists i mention above)."
negative,The onesies were too small and shrunk immediately--had to be given away.: The size ordered were what she normally wears--but were smaller than comparable clothes of the same type. Very disappointing.
negative,"PRUNELLA SCALES NO HEIGHTS: I've always been a fan of the British actress Prunella Scales and already own some of her readings of classic novels, including Cranford which she handles delightfully.So it was a big disappointment to find that she seems to have completely misjudged her narration of Emma. One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."
positive,"Unique presentation of the vampire genre: This is a truly unique novel. Newman presents us with a London virtually taken over by the undead. Vampires have come out of hiding and are now fully ""out"". Living people (referred to as ""warm"") flock to be turned, and vampires are now found in every walk of life from government to shop keeper to prostitute. Newman is extremely detailed, and he introduces numerous characters while weaving in actual historical occurrences into the story. We get a glimpse of this London at the time of the Whitechapel murders; only this time, the Ripper preys on vamp prostitutes, and his identity harkens back to Stoker's DRACULA.All in all, this is a delightful and creative novel. It is a breath of fresh air amidst the Lestat wannabes. Keeping up with all the different characters can be a task, but if you give this novel a chance, you most definitely won't be disappointed. This is the first novel of a trilogy, and I'm rushing to read the next in the series (BLOODY RED BARON)."
positive,"Excellent Urban Tale: Garden's Corner catches the flavor of growing up in New York City, without trying to have flava. It is the tale of Little Speedy Copeland, a young Black man trying to understand life in the aftermath of a terrible incident. Like main characters in many great stories he goes through a journey of discovery and redemption. The story rings true with many realistic details and personalities and it does not try to exagerate or belittle. Highly recommended."
positive,"Live review: I had a copy of this album back in the 90's but somehow lost it. After hearing some of the live tracks on the radio, I had to have it again. Out of all the CD's that I own, this is one of my favorites. Peter's vocals on this album and the extra added to the songs are awesome.buy it,"
positive,"Easy to use, trusted: After opening the package, I simply plugged this in to a wall socket (making sure that it is not near a heating source, gas, moving air, dust or sunlight). I tested it, the alarm rang loud and clear. A red light lets me know that it is functional.I feel better having it in my house."
positive,"Very approachable: This ambitious evolutionary approach to the vertebrate nervous system gives the student all the tools needed to proceed with the advanced (3-volume)works of Crosby, et al (paleo) and Niuwenhuys, et al(neo). The text is well organized and has only a slight amount of redundancy. Would hope the next edition would have improved and possibly colorful figures. This will become the only ""one volume"" classic of vertebrate comparative neuroanatomy."
negative,"East West, this is not Rushdie's best!: Sure, there's imagination in this book, but the language used to put it across is not worth talking about. It was a major disappointment after I'd read Midnight's Children and the Moor's Last Sigh. It's not a book worth buying and I'd only advise borrowing it if you're really bored (or curious, I suppose)."
positive,"Quality: A quality read without question. I was with The Bruce. I struggled right along with him.. My my, I cried at the end, and at some parts in between.. Mr. Tranter was a talented man who knew his country and its history well. Whoever said that Tranter cannot write like Penman, I say, read it again. To love your country, to give up everything and everyone for the good of it.. Wow, Im off to read Wallace, for he is in this novel as well, and just makes it enough that I am happy that he has his own tale to tell."
positive,"I read this book 10 years ago...: I read this book back in high school, thinking ""Well, it's a classic. One of those books I SHOULD read."" I was right. There are so many things I have not forgotten about this book, and given that it's been that long ago, it's amazing.I think that we all know how the story goes. Government censorship, Big Brother is douple plus un good. No books or writing. So on and so forth. Authoritarian, totalitarian, dictatorship. Not sure what exactly the government would fall under; not a big government/history buff.This is one of those books I am truly happy to have read. There's constant references to this in media, pop culture, etc. It's just an important piece of literature. I think every single person who cares about their own intelligence should read this book. You just HAVE TO! Nuff said."
negative,COBALT DRILL BITS: HAVE USED THE 1/4 IN BIT ABOUT 3 TIMES AND IT IS ALREADY SHOWING SIGNS OF DULLING. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BITS THUS FAR. WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN .
positive,"Great Collaboration of Products!!!: This a great combo of cleaning/care products for my car. It was exactly what I was looking for. If you know what all these products are, then you will understand this is a great purchase. Everything included is really all that is needed for a perfectly clean car. The only thing missing is the bucket, water, and a good means of drying (I used one of those super absorbent towels rather than a chamois)."
negative,"Light is very dim: I was excited to get this thinking it would light up like the picture shows. Well I should know better than that. I bought the green jellyfish, and while it does light up, you can hardly see it unless it is pitch black outside, even then it does not light up the water at all and now my jelly is floating sideways. It does not even float upright."
positive,"Gladiator: I liked this movie. The scenes are a little darker due to the setting or time period, but it is very well done. Action packed with romantic scenes. For more mature audiences."
positive,Hit the spot: I have always had a curiosity about nuns which would include their habits and this book was the only one I was able to find that helped break it down.Thanks!
negative,"A Wretched Production: This reprint is so ugly in its typography and layout that I sent it back and bought a used copy of the 1970 edition. The reprint is smaller than the original, and to compensate, the publishers have not only cut the margins down to almost nothing, but have compressed the text horizontally so that the character glyphs are unpleasantly out of proportion. Do not buy this edition unless you are completely indifferent to typography and graphic design."
positive,"Like Hearing Bruckner for the First Time: I have listened to Bruckner for more years than I'd care to admit, but these recordings by Eugen Jochum are like hearing him for the first time. It is startling how good these recordings are, and what freshness Jochum brings to the more familiar Bruckner offerings...the 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th and 9th. Electrifying is not too strong a word to describe them. In addition, these EMI recordings are an astonishing value. Buy and listen for yourself. I dare you not to be transfigured by the music-making."
negative,"Don't!: It would have been more honest if these players had just presented this disc as their own interpretations of these fine songs. These songs do NOT sound as though the Beatles were doing them. Any creditable musicians with genuine love for the early Beatles sound and atmosphere could have done a better job recreating these numbers, if that was the desire. For a good comparison, listen to ""That Means A Lot"" done by Billy Sullivan (not half so well known as Vinny Fazzari), on his ""All American Popster"" album -- exquisite!"
negative,"Don't bother.: This book is appallingly written, brazenly self-promoting and transparently biased to the left. It is full of cloying rhetorical questions (""They never shared their lunch with a starving Japanese child,"" supposedly characterizing younger Congressional Republicans -- how would Brokaw know who they'd shared lunch with, anyway?) and laughable self-contradictions (in a book that purportedly applauds the old-fashioned values, he criticizes Dole for being out of touch with the younger generation's self-absorption in his presidential campaign). Whenever he can work it in, he slings it to the Republicans, those meanies who care about no one but themselves. Critical thinkers will find this book superficial and opportunistic."
positive,"Best Computer Acessory: A year and a half ago, I purchased everything I needed for my first computer. I did a lot of research and went way wrong with highly recommended Dell computer. But, based on what I could see at the store (the clerks at CompUSA are not too eager to help) I bought this printer. It has been the best purchase of my computing experience. Photos are flawless, as is everything else I print with this printer. It seeems to do what it is supposed to and musch more incredibly well."
negative,"Lots of errors: This book is misleading. Contains impressive amount of errors, that leads readers to learn wrong concepts. I am starting to doubt that this book was written by a Phd. Or if it was, then lets revoke his title. Hope they release some decent review on this."
negative,"Disappointed: This mug warmer does NOT keep coffee at the temperature it was when I put the ceramic cup on the warmer. It keeps it warm, yes, but not hot. I still have to reheat it if i leave it for any length of time.It might be fine if you're drinking warm milk, but if you like hot coffee, I think you'll be disappointed -- as I am.The lack of auto shut-off is a problem, but I knew that when I bought it, so I just have to be vigilant about turning it off when I leave my desk."
positive,"Brilliantly evocative of the mythological West: This upgraded reissue presents potent, early work that is essential to Robbins' catalog. Sony has cleaned up the audio, added new liner notes and augmented the original disc with bonus tracks.Robbins' 1959 LP is oddly anachronistic, having ridden a wave of Old West nostalgia that is now itself 40 years old. Even so, his highly-romanticized images of cowboys and outlaws are as captivating today as the (single!) day on which this album was recorded. Robbins' singing is breathtaking, backed perfectly by the Glaser Brothers and spiced with Grady Martin's Mexicali-flavored guitar. Classics like ""Big Iron"" and ""El Paso"" linger in the air like the smell of sagebrush, resulting in an album whose allure is as strong as its mythological subjects."
negative,"Cheaply made boot: Had these boots for a while. First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying. The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay haven't done that before, had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear, even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They don't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price!"
positive,"Great book!!!: My son is issued this book from the school. So as to not have him bring books home, I buy duplicate books for him to use at home."
positive,Recommend this seller: I recieved this book on time and in excellent condition. I'd definitely recommend this seller.
negative,"If the book has ruined for you any chance of ever sleeping soundly again, take heart...: ... the film will then take all that surreal horror your imagination has been running wild with, and transform it into parody. What a joke! At least I'll catch some ZZZs tonight."
positive,"Well made CD by C-Murder: Tru,this CD does not rank up there with his debut album ""Life or death""in terms of emotions,but the party joints on this CD are enough to make up for that.When C-Murder does try to be emotional in ""Where do we go""feat.Young Silkk,he fails.The beats are too fast for an emotional song and the vocals are garbage.The good songs,however,are ,#2,#3feat.Snoop Dogg and the Eastdidaz,#4feat.Master P and Erica Fox,#5 feat.Da Brat and Jermaine Dupri,#6 feat Fat Joe,#10 feat. Mystikal,#14 feat.D.I.G and Master P,#15 feat.Mac,Magic,and Ms.Peaches,#19(this a very funny interlude with Soulja Slim's music playing in the background),and #23 feat.Snoop and Magic."
positive,"It was sure that it would win the Hugo and Nebula Awards: There ain't much to say about this book else then: SUPERB! It really takes hold of it, makes you read it and then desire for the sequel-book ""Dune Messiah"". A rich family, currently ruling the Planet Calladan, is sent by the Emperor to take control of the Desert Planet Arrakis. The only known place were the ""Spice"" is found. The Spice became an important resource, because it sharpens the mind of the consumer and in some rare occasions can make people look into the future. Who rules the Spice, rules the Universe. There's only one tiny problem about it. Arrakis is currently run by the archrivals of our rich family and they just don't want to give up the best income-source in the universe."
positive,Dressage Today: Simple if you ride Dressage or know some one who does they should get this magazine.It keeps you up to date with what's going on I'n the sport and has great articles from different experts every month.Great Gift
positive,"Truth is stanger (and funnier) than fiction!: This movie is a must see for anyone who has worked in a ""cubicle dweller enviromnet"". This movie is much more true to life than I had expected (don't fear the dog who barks, fear the dog who quietly growls). Almost every scene in this movie has happened to me in some way, shape or form (""PC Letter Load?!?! What the ---- does that mean?!?!""). Anyone who doesn't find this movie funny must either: Never have worked in a large company, gone straight to middle management, or be utterly humorless. One of the funniest movies I have seen in a while."
positive,"Circling sharks: They both circle and stalk each other, use each other's styles, and general have a good old fashion cutting session. First rate for Diz and, Little Jazz fans."
positive,"Will Put A Smile On Your Face!: This is really one of NRBQ's finest pieces of work. Once again they proved themselves to be the classiest combo in music by really stepping back and letting Skeeter Davis shine. Her duets with Joey, Al, and Terry are a joy and there is just so much warmth and good humor in this collection that it's a pleasure to listen to. A match made in heaven!"
positive,"Great kids book!: These are some of the best children's books I have ever read (and I've read many a bedtime story!). This one is a house favorite and has been read so many times none of us have to look at the words anymore. They rhyme throughout each book (which helps the children read along), have a very cute story my kids love to read over and over and I can't forget to mention the great illustrations. One other bonus to this installment in the Jillian Jiggs series is the instructions in the back of the book on how to make your own 'Wonderful Pigs'."
negative,wrong item sent/can't get a response: I bought the arm band but they sent me the waist band and I can't get a response from them.
negative,Take a class: Don't waste your money. If she had been my instructor I would have asked for my money back
negative,"Bad movie? You're soaking in it: Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague."
positive,Uranium 4 Uranus: What can I say? I'm on medication that causes severe constipation. I bought this item with one of the recommended applicators. It works like a charm! I've never been happier!!Wifey does insist that I use public toilets but that's a small price to pay!
negative,"""Hit the gas,Grasshopper!"": Before David Carradine experienced a career revival of sorts in Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" movies&crossed; swords with The Bride,Uma Thurman,he was Cannonball,A Man on the Run.The plot is completely nonsensical;it involves a cross-country race.David Carradine gets helped by car geeks,has a strange convenience store brawl,shows off his chest for no reason whatsoever&a; squeaky voiced Marilyn Monroe lookalike goes to bed with an unpleasingly plump bad guy.Okay,it's a cross country race,David Carradine has to win to clear his name--it's good dumb fun.Need I say more?"
positive,"It never gets old.: I recently purchased ""Mambo Kings"" on DVD. I've watched it many times on VHS and it was time to update and use my surround sound system so that I get the full effect of the music. If your into good looking men with a passion for latin music and women, you need to see this one. Makes me wish I was born earlier to participate in the dancing too."
positive,"Excellent Romance: I have to disagree with the editorial reviewers who stated that the book falls apart at the end. I found this to be a solid romance, enjoyable cover to cover - a nice quick read, far better than so many other titles that have been released lately."
negative,Just buy The Fall of Reach.: Just buy the Fall of Reach. It's a fun read while the other two are big ol' stinky turds.
negative,"Nasty: Take some good advice! Find three of your best buddies, rent a mountain cabin and replace Dreamcatcher's tainted mind infusion with wonderful memories deserving of the setting. Who wants to spend a thousand pages of time reading about extreme body gas and the ""f"" word (purposely not capitalized) repeated over and over again in every imaginable contortion, etc? (I will always wonder how this kind of ""carrying on"" gets published in the first place, regardless of who wrote it.)"
negative,"Not Suitable for Blu-ray: The color scheme that was used for this Blu-ray product looks unnatural and is not true to the original film. The color changes are so pathetic that the Blu-ray production should be called ""The French Disconnection"""
positive,The most eye opening movie on sexual issuses: Everyone should watch this movie.This movie really helps to see how sex is viewed by society at that particular era.
negative,"weak story but interesting ideas: This book is a classic but suffers from any of the problems of antiquated sci fi. It is not character driven, but is more about the authors neat fictional idea and the character is more of an after thought."
positive,"Josef Strauss and the Family Formula.: London-born violinist and conductor John Georgiadis is in charge here, exhuming and enlivening long-forgotten dance music from the pen of Josef Strauss. After he was bulldozed into joining the family dance-music business, engineer-trained Josef (1827-1870) proved to be the most industrious of all the Strauss family during the remainder of his short life. I reckon, having collected and listened to all the volumes so far issued in this Marco Polo Josef Strauss Edition, that inspiration and innovation did not always keep up with his gruelling work schedule. Reliance on the family formula seems evident in most of the items on this CD, where you'll find a spanking little march, three waltzes, a quadrille and a variety of polkas, heard best at concert hall volume so that subtle lifts in rhythm and phrase and the skilful orchestration are heard to best advantage."
positive,"A pleasant surprise: It's possible I've missed the point and, no, I haven't seen the comics but this movie has to be one of the most (only?) enjoyable in the ""demon"" genre. For the first half-hour I wondered whether I'd made a serious mistake. After that, I learnt to enjoy the ride and the laughs.I'm now entirely convinced the movie was intended to be tongue-in-cheek, entertaining and stimulating - in all of which it has succeeded. It definitely presses a few buttons and perhaps its detractors' funny bones were bumped a little too hard?"
negative,"too slow a burn on DVD-R: I purchased this unit because it advertised 16x burn on DVD-Rs. I used 4 different brands of DVD-Rs listed on the website for this unit. None of them recorded faster than 2x. I could not get it to even record a DVD+R faster than 2x. I returned the unit after 3 days of trying different software configurations. Nothing I tried increased the burn rate faster than 2x.The only reason it deserves a ""2 stars"" is because it plays back very well and did produce a good recorded DVD-R, it just takes ""half a lifetime"" to complete a burn."

negative,"Not impressed: This product didn't work as well as I had hoped. It doesn't hurt, but it also doesn't remove all of the hair. I had to go behind and pluck my eyebrows (even longer hairs that should have been picked up by the strips). Save your money and buy wax instead."
positive,"Look in yourself: The ability to heal is in all of us. It does not matter whether Prot is from K-Pax or earth. What is important is that humanity sometimes alienates individuals who then as a self-fulfilling prophecy alienate themselves. Prot was the alien necessary to re-socialize the alienated.Personally I think this goes a lot further than mental conditions because a lot of physical conditions are caused by our minds, thus healing these will also lie within our own minds.If you believe that you can heal, you will heal."
negative,"One of the worst movies ever.: The acting is horrible. The story is nonexistent. This is a movie that is surely not worth your time.The special effects are its one redeeming factor, but they can't redeem this movie. The only good thing about this compared to Transformers 2 is that there is less screaming in this one."
negative,Not 8 just 4!: They are good but it's not a set of 8 just 4! So I was dissapointed because wanted to use all 8 and because of the price (twice more expensive that it seemed).
positive,"Very Enjoyable: ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a delightful and entertaining historical romance, that explores the life of Mary Boleyn as well as her more famous sister, Anne. It does not seem like Philippa Gregory did extensive research, as the book was rather short on description of life in the Tudor era. But the characters and their relationships were interesting, and kept me turning the pages until the end."
negative,Do NOT buy this product: I have been using Pampers Swaddlers size 3 but because of the outrageous price increase I switched to Pampers Dry economy pack......my child's linen is now wet in the mornings and blowouts have been horrible. And now I am stuck with 2 boxes of unusable diapers. How could Pampers sell such an inferior product. I am switching to another brand and another source (such as Costco) from now on.
positive,"One of Loudon's Best!: For me, Loudon's best work was on the trio of studio albums he did for Rounder: Fame and Wealth, I'm Alright and More Love Songs (the latter two co-produced by Richard Thompson). I'm Alright finds Loudon on the top of his game with several ""wit meets pathos"" classics, including One Man Guy (later covered - perhaps with double meaning - by his son Rufus) and the title cut. Cardboard Boxes is a great acoustic rocker about the woes of moving and Daddy Takes a Nap has a great last line. Loudon mostly avoids the sometimes too personal musings of his later work (starting, IMO, with the first post-Rounder album), but the most personal song here, Screaming Issue (about daughter Lucy Roche), manages to touch the heart without making you cringe. And a great band, too, featuring several of Thompson's collaborators and at least on Fairporter."
negative,"Keep Your Memories: If you have pleasant memories of seeing this movie as a child, leave it that way. You will be sorely disappointed if you rent (let alone buy) this movie. Visually it is very beautiful and it looks like the same animators who did The Hobit. The story is okay and the acting is bearable, but the music is awful!!! This overextended depressing 80s music really ruins it. The best way to enjoy this film is on a poster."
positive,"Entertaining Education: A good choice for those who are not a ble to make it to birthing class, or those that want additional information. Funny, witty and covers everything from start to end."
negative,APC MAKES JUNK BX900R: I spent a lot of money for this unit and got about one year of use out of it before it started constantly beeping and overloading. I replaced the batteries with new ones plugged it in and it still overloads with nothing attached to it. I deduced from reading all the other reviews that this is a poor design on cooling the circuit board. The unit runs hot with nothing attached. I guess the cheap fan doesn't last too long and you ruin the warranty by replacing it. If you go to the APC site the unit is discontinued thank goodness they retired it. This will be the last APC product I buy.
positive,Ham Radio well represented: One of the best films to highlight Ham Radio accurately ... much better than the lame attampts in modern film. And Bonita is a cute little actress... The plots are ok too.
positive,good series: Extreme Trains is a good show for people who want to know a little bit about railroading. Matt bown is a little hyper and awkward sometimes. There is lots of good information presented and interesting facts. If you have no intrest in trains this will put you to sleep. It would make a good Christmas present for younger kids and old people. Me personally I am a little bit of a train fan so I liked the show a good amount.
positive,good buy at the time...: Bought this as a gift for my wife way way back in 2005-6 ish. It was excellent back then. Had to ebay it off in this era of smartphones and still got a pretty good price for it!
negative,"Smell terrible, leaky and expensive: The only reason I gave these diapers 2 stars is because they prevent diaper rash if you aren't able to change a wet diaper right away. Otherwise they're awful. The baby powder smell is overpowering and stinks up the baby as well as the baby's clothes. They're also leaky at night because of the lack of padding in the back, so if the baby lays on his or her back while sleeping, protection is unreliable. They don't work for 12 hours at night like the package says. I've used Pampers in 2 other countries--Japan and the Philippines--and the American ones are cheap looking and stinky like the ones sold in the Philippines but cost more than the Japanese ones. The Japanese ones are unscented, don't leak at night, and are cheaper than the American ones sold in stores. The only good thing about buying them at Amazon is that you can get a better price on them, but in my opinion they're not worth buying no matter how cheap."
negative,"No better than a corded phone: Phone works fine, but signal dropouts begin when any more than 10 feet from the base. My old 47mhz cordless works better from the same location."
positive,"A must for any avid reader!: I paid the extra money and bought the hardback illustrated version of The Hobbit. It is one of the finest books in my collection. I just finished reading it for the first time, at age 26, and can't wait to dive into The Lord of the Rings. I highly recomend this book to anyone considering purchasing it. The illustrations are hand-painted and are of a very high quality. The book is printed on glossy paper, with very good binding. And the cover is embroidered with a gold dragon on the cover, and gold lettering along the spine. Well worth the money!"
negative,Not every book is created equal.: Greatly disappointed that I paid over $6.00 for a book that turned out to be a pamphlet size booklet.
negative,Don't Buy The Batcave: My 4 year old son received the Batcave for Christmas. I know it is about $40. It took my hubby 1/2 hour to put together - is EXTREMELY flimsy & my son got batman stuck in the bat elevator within the first 2 minutes of using it. Soooooo not worth it. What a let down.
negative,cheaper at target: I purchased this set in early december paid over 40.00 -- the next week target had it on sale for 23.00 returned it ... also bought another dvd set(house) and also found that for over 20.00 cheaper at bjs ... the week before christmas amazon put this on sale .... check your prices look around... I overpaid by a total of 40.00 then was charged 3.00 each by amazon for returning it and it took over a week for my credit to come though....
positive,for dummies: this book certainly does spell things out in simple form and provides a lot of valuable information particularly to those that don't know much about these birds.
positive,"I love SOKEN Ramen: I think the Spicy Dragon is very good, although not that spicy, if you want something a little more spicy try the Wasabi with green tea noodles. This has been the only msg free and vegetarian ramen that I have been able to purchase in my local stores and now none of them carry it any longer. Thank god for the internet."
negative,"won't display on Fire: I love the book,and sent it to my wife as a gift, but since it won'y display on her Fire, I have to give it one star. Funny, because the sample displays on minejist fine(but not on hers)."
negative,"wannabe: Mr Davidar thought he was writing the great Indian novel. Unfortunately, what came out at the end was a schoolboy effort, characterized by Raj cliches, prose that sounds like it is translated, and occasional paragraphs containing personal views on India and Indians which dont mesh with the main text at all. I am glad I borrowed this free of cost from the library and did not waste my money - though I did waste my time reading it. All I can say is that it would make good reading on a long flight - at least the story has tempo and keeps you mildly entertained."
positive,"A heart-filling and loving story!: This book tells about how four young girls and a mother grow and prosper,learn the morals of life, and learn to cope with anything and anyone to come their way. They never forget one another and learn fron their mistakes. If you're a real girly girl, Little Women is the book to read!"
negative,"Defective out of the box: Right out of the box, the tuner was defective. On both AM and FM, there was an extremely annoying ""POP!"" sound every five seconds. As a test for the problem, if you leave the AM antenna disconnected and turn up the volume, it's very obvious. When the AM and FM antennas are properly connected, you won't hear it so much on loud music, but during quieter passages the five second interval click is a real nuisance.The Sony support website Knowledge Article C399832 for ""Popping or clicking noise when playing the radio"" suggests unplugging the unit for a minute and then plugging it in again, but that didn't help. The suggestion in that case is ""service may be required"". I also called the Sony 800 number and spoke to a service rep who admitted that the unit needed repair. Well, since I only bought it last night, it's obviously going back to the store.File this one in the Sony junk product category..."
positive,"Journey To Hell: This is actually a retitled and edited version of John Bunyan's, ""The Life and Death of Mr. Badman,"" which is otherwise rather hard to locate these days. Its lesser popularity is most likely due to the subject matter, which focuses upon sin, and the fact that it doesn't have the ""happy ending"" most people seem to require. However, it is a terrific work, definitely the equal of Pilgrim's Progress or Grace Abounding. Bunyan, as usual, finds new meaning in many verses of scripture that one might otherwise overlook. If you like John Bunyan's work and don't have this, get it. It's a keeper."
negative,"ok: It is a decent little kit, but not worth the $ you pay for it. Little disappointed, could have used more in the kit."
positive,Thanks BGS!: This is my first time to order wheat grass and I'm very happy with my choice. The product arrived faster then expected and the seeds look great. I can't wait to try them out.
negative,"One episode cannot define a season: Smallville season 9 is downright the worst season of Smallville. The plot is not interesting at all. The plot of Smallville has really gone downhill. However, the finale episode showed great promise. I believe that where smallville really got messed up, was when Micheal Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) wanted to leave the show. In my opinion ""Lex Luthor"" was a big reason why the first 5-7 seasons of Smallville where so good. I think if the producers could convince Rosenbaum to come back, that would turn the show around.Overall, I thought season 9 of Smallville just was not very good, however, I have hopes that the 10th (and final) season will be great!"
positive,"Hilarious, yet meaningful: With each Twain novel I read, I am amazed at how he can be so funny while packing such astute insights about life. This novel is no exception as Twain strikes the balance between the two again here. The premise for this novel is perhaps Twain's most original idea (when did Tom Sawyer ever time travel?) and the story and characters satisify at every turn. While this isn't Twain's best work, I think that some of his funniest moments are in this novel. I recommend Tom Sawyer as the place to begin reading Twain, but if you are already a fan then this book is a must-read."
negative,"it sounds like mice being tortured: having heard lots of positive buzz about this CD, i listened to it at borders. i quickly found myself frantically skipping through the tracks, trying to find a single one that did not make me want to egg the cars of the producers who created this monstrosity.buy the beu sisters' CD instead. you'll be glad you did. tatu = p.u."
positive,"Great Resource for Parents and Their Soccer Players: With no background in soccer, I was at a loss, and as a new soccer player, so was my son. I took advantage of the ""Parent Soccer Coach"" DVD as a tool for our family's mutual ""Soccer Education"". My son enjoyed watching the DVD and used it to reinforce what he was learning on his team. He also seemed to get a lot of self-affirmation from the DVD by pointing out his knowledge & skills.This DVD offers an easy & convenient way to build awareness of soccer for the entire family."
negative,"Don't buy this vacuum: We bought the Hoover Deluxe Elite Rewind vacuum a little over a year ago. It seemed great at first but then things started to go wrong. It seemed to loses some suction a few months ago and then the suction for the hose became so bad it would barely even spin the brush, so of course wouldn't actually pick up anything from furniture. Then today it just died while I was in the middle of vacuuming. It just shut off and wouldn't turn on again right away. I tried again several minutes later and it re-started but we are now shopping around for a different vacuum. I had researched before buying this one and bought it because of it's great reviews but have not been pleased at all. I'm sorry I spent any money on it at all!"
negative,"I, Bored: What a boring movie. There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours, but not by much. Every scene begins with a door sliding open to reveal Will Smith (of whom, I can't say I'm a fan) and/or his dialogue partner (I don't dare call much of what anyone does in this 'acting'). I've never seen Bridget Moynahan in anything else, and I hope the trend continues--what a bland, monotonous person.The commentary is likewise boring, and repetitive, with pretty much nothing interesting to offer... much like the movie.The only bright point would be Alan Tudyk's performance as Sonny the robot. Capable actors James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, and Chi McBride are all pretty much wasted in bland background roles, in favor of Will Smith's wise-cracking good cop with a troubled past cliche--I mean, 'character'. At least they didn't find a way to shoehorn one of his songs into the movie. Watch it only if you must."
positive,"Lord of The Flies Review: I thought this book was very interesting in many ways. It really opened my eyes to the evil nature of human beings, and how, if we let it, that evil nature will come out. When they first land on the island, the boys are all dressed in a uniform, and they are proper, as their upbringing would cause them to be. There is, however, a huge difference in their appearance and attitudes at the end of the novel. All of the boys are dressed up like savages, with paint on their bodies. None of them care at all about rules or regulations or what is right or wrong. That shows just how easily humans can turn from good to evil. I enjoyed reading Lord of The Flies because there was usually never a dull moment. In every chapter, there was always something new developing. This was a very good book."
positive,"Depressing, but enlightening.: As an American, I enjoy freedoms that are alien to the majority of the world. If this had any effect on my life, it made me appreciate where and how I live my life. The book itself was very well written and entertaining. The beginning of the book was depressing to the point where I didn't want to read it, but as I progressed, I started to enjoy it. It was very difficult to emphasize with Winston because I cannot imagine the world he lives in. As I reflect on the book as a whole, I realize that it was more than worth my time to read. Every person who reads this book gets something different out of it, but I can guarentee if you read with interest you will get something out of it."
positive,"Best adult read of a childhood tale: Tolkien brought this tale to life in a quick and pleasant read. I took to the tale which held my interest as an adult, and brought back my love of reading as a child. Highly recommended!"
positive,"Nylon Lead: Not that my pet needs a lead, but it's the law. It is working out really well. Has not been chewed through yet. :-)"
negative,a terrible representation of the intricacy of Tolkien's work: This video along with all the other animated films mocks the significance of Tolkien's work to the fantasy genre. The only possible reason a person would enjoy this film is if s/he is a child or has never read the books. Support of these movies is a tell tale example of the weakening literacy of the population.
positive,"Amazon.com and the world should take notice of Paolini...: Christopher Paolini was already quite the gifted writer at age 15 when he submerged himself in the writing of this book which he claims ""ate him alive!"" He is now 18 and I look forward to meeting him at Island Books on Mercer Island, WA when he visits on October 25th! At age 38, I am not yet at the close of this great classic, yet I am eagerly awaiting the next! I almost don't want to complete it...I don't want the story to end! My 12 and 14 year old sons are in line to read it next, since I rarely rave over a book. I want my sons to see what they can accomplish if they set their minds to it. What a joy to slip into this novel! I would give it 50 stars if that were an option."
negative,Disappointed with the finish: The unit I received is full of scratches on the surface. I am not sure if it's a brand new unit or not. since it works fine I just didn't bother to exchange for another one.
negative,"Wrong one: It was to be the restored edition with the protagonist named Talos, this one has him as Stark. So then it is the original version. Not as advertised."
positive,"Interesting and engaging: The author, ""a journalist and travel writer,"" manages the difficult task of keeping all of the names of various kings, dukes, and earls straight without descending into a tedious recitation of dynasties. This is a very interesting book and is written in an engaging style while still managing to be a serious work of history. Good job."
positive,"Hurrah for Bradbury!: Art imitating life? One need only contemplate the depths of political correctness to see the coming new order. Utopian societies are hellish and brutally banal at the same time. Like Jerry Furland's terrifying novel ""Transfer - the end of the beginning"", Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" delivers a message and a vision of the future that is bleakly horrifying. You will devour both of these fine novels in a sitting. Guaranteed."
positive,"Cute Story of Two Brothers: I thought this was the most adorable movie ever! My boyfriend and I went on Christmas (we're 22 and 21 years old), and we both loved it! Michael J. Fox was perfect as the voice of Stuart, and I've loved Jonathan Lipnicki since Jerry Maguire! Don't miss this cute movie!"
positive,"Excellent book for those who own companion lovebirds: A visit to my local library yielded many books about breeding lovebirds, with little focus on the pet owner who wished to keep a single lovebird just as a pet. This book was a lifesaver! It was thorough, as well as fun and simple to read. I am buying the Cockatiel book in the same series for a friend who owns one because this book impressed me so much!"
negative,"If only Hollywood...: Could stop making horrible movies such as this, then there'd be a chance for something good to come out more than usual. I can't begin to say how bad it was. The SFX weren't nearly as good as the first, the acting was worse (though I didn't think that'd be possible), and the worst part about the movie was The Rock's head superimposed on a scorpion's body! Ye gods, that was pathetic. I was going into the movie expecting a massive 3-man brawl b/w the Mummy, Fraser, and The Rock. That would've made the movie more enjoyable, but alas, Hollywood couldn't be that interesting. So, if you're looking for an enjoyable action flick, look elsewhere. Go buy ""Predator"" and see what Hollywood used to put out as an action flick. Don't waste your money on this trash."
negative,"Great Beginning--Disappointing in Total: I loved the first chapter of ""Surrender.."" and then the author killed off the most interesting character... But even worse, there are huge psychological flaws here... Flat characters.. Unrealistic portrait of a mother's grief .. and an ending that is so out of touch with the mother's reality.. It's just too light and doesn't , as so many books seem not to, deliver on its initial promise... Yet, on the positive side, the scenes are vivid, memorable and ditto some of the characters.. But that beginning was SO promising.. that the rest drops you into sadness.. not about the death portrayed but about the value of a great story that doesn't begin to meet its promise."
negative,the plot itself could make a movie on Lifetime or Oxygen: do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book.
positive,"NOIR FOR CONNOISSEURS!: It doesn't get any better than this. The delicious writing and cool, gritty ""look"" of the film is perfect. No one's more male, sexy or gorgeous than Richard Conte at his height, an icon of 1950's style and attitude, in love with a young, blonde femme fatale. But once she (Cornel Wilde's real wife Jean Wallace) finds out that he's married, God help him."
negative,"Copy of a copy: This was definitely NOT worth $25. I could have made a better copy off my DVR. What a waste of money, time, and effort."
positive,Gets the job done: I bought this for my daughter when we went on vacation to the beach. Its quick and easy set up. The only negative side is that it is very lightweight and could easily blow away while at the beach so we put all of her toys in there and it was wonderful. It covered her from the sun and gave her her own little play area and i recommend it to anyone going away to a sunny place.
negative,"Warning... leaks ahead!: These leak every single day! Please avoid and save yourself money, time, misery and agony.We committed the mistake of buying a big pack."
positive,HIGH QUALITY: Strong hinges and clasps. Rigid case body. Firm foam inserts. Made in the USA really makes a difference. I highly recommend these cases.
positive,"Early walker.: This is a great toy that helped my daughter take her first running steps. I was however a little disappointed as I thought the music would play with just moving the walker forward to give her incentive to keep going, but actually the music only plays with a hard bump or touching the face on the front."
positive,"In regards to: ""Clay's Claymates Attack"": Everyone could go round and round whether Clay Aiken's CD is worthy or not but it all comes down to ONE thing...we all have our own opinions on music and the types of music we choose to listen to. As for radio stations denying playing any of his songs....well, just one little tidbit to think about...there are some songs on the radio now that I could care less about hearing but they still have the chance to be aired on radio. So why shouldn't Clay's song? Little hint: If you don't like the song playing on the radio at the moment--flip it to something else. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. Play fair!"
negative,"A let down: Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King. I own most of his stuff and have been working on reading everything of his for years now. But this one just doesn't cut it for me. It's boring and hard to follow compared with his other stuff. If you've never read King before and are trying to pick a book of his to start out with, avoid this one. He has plenty of others that will blow your mind."
positive,"The Stranger means a hell of a lot.: The basic problem of The Stranger isalienation. Meursalt kills a man, butdoesn't feel sorry for killing him.Why not? Is it because his mother dieda few days earlier? Is it because ofhis refusal to believe in God? May itjust be that his life is utterly meaningless?Those who read the afterword in the Penguinedition of The Stranger (The Outsider)must consider the author's explanation -'So one wouldn't be far wrong in seeingthe The Outsider as the story of a man who,without any heroic pretentions, agrees todie for the truth.' 'The Stranger doesn'tmean anything' is a lie. Why? Meursaltdoesn't think so. Secondly, Albert Camusdoesn't think so. And thirdly, thereviewer doesn't think so."
negative,"Doesn't warm bottles: Ever been in a car on a long distance trip with a cold bottle and a hungry baby? Let me tell you how obnoxious it is to have a bottle warmer that, even after 20 minutes, still has not heated that cold bottle. Don't buy this product."
positive,"For the price, great product.: As it states in the title, for the price great product. Seems to be accurate up to .01. When testing the same object, no deviation from the original measure up to .01.Only issues, it is what you pay for. It feels a little cheap, but that's ok. Doesn't feel as if it will break. Issue, and why it is only 4 stars is the roller on it is all but inoperable. Other than that, comes in a good case, extra battery, and seems nice...again, for the price."
negative,Disappointed: I read this book and hoped against hope for something new in vampire lore but it's basically the same old stuff not very interestingly written.
positive,A Christmas Carol review: I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. I know this story so well and have seen countless movies and versions of it. Nothing beats reading the original Christmas story. I plan on 're-reading this story every year at Christmas.
positive,"Youngbloodz Classic Debut: With classic cuts like 85 f/ Big Boi, U-Way (How We Do It), Shakem' Off, and Pop,Pop,Pop this album is a must have. It has great production, and is an overall classic album. Pick it up if you want to hear the dirty south's finest, Youngbloodz."
negative,"Doesn't live up to its potential. . .: The Third Secret is a very good story; unfortunately its written in a mediocre manner. The plot is shallow and poorly developed and at times, obvious. Its more akin to the work of an amateur than a published author. Although Berry seems to have stumbled while penning this work, the editor has badly let the reader down; errors in prose, style and consistency are too numerous to mention.I suggest those who wish to read Berry's work wait for the paperback edition or visit their public library. The Third Secret is a poor waste of hard earned wages."
positive,A class act!!!!: This book is a must have. It lets you into Troy's world and really does show what a class act he is.
positive,"Great Book: My nephew Nathan says: ""I think that the dragons and the dragon riders were cool. I also liked Durza. Overall, it was a really good book. I highly recomend it if you're really into magical beings""."
negative,"The Complete Fraud: This book pretends to be ""A Comprehensive Dictionary .....(of) Military Terms"" But most of the entries are not military at all, and a a majority of them are surely known to any third grade child... I want a refund on the money I spent for it!."
negative,"just say no: I watched this movie sometime in the late 80's. It disturbed meto the point that I've never forgotten it, and never will.Take my advise and don't fill your mind with this trash. It willstain your soul. If you like to see lots and lots of violent rapethen this movie is for you and you need help. I can't imaginewhy anyone would make this movie. There is enough of this typeof horrible stuff in the real world without adding a fantasyversion."
negative,"A modern day Joseph story: _Out of the Silence_ shows us the downward spiral of three years without being able to speak, not knowing what God was doing. It must have been as difficult and discouraging as Joseph's years before he was exalted as a leader in Egypt and later saved his family. Duane teaches us much about learning from God in difficult times."
negative,Returned it: This book is not like he rest of Dale Carnegie's books. The rest of hem are interesting and easy reeds. This'd one is bad
positive,"What Can I Say?: Possibly one of the greatest works of fiction ever written, it's only rivals are were authored by the same man."
positive,"who's the archeologist?: The book makes a great read, same as DHC's other books of the ""Lost Cities"" series. Very entertaining, thought provoking, and well written. One thing though: I don't get why the author keeps calling himself ""a rogue archeologist"": someone has to explain to him what archeologists do. DHC is no archeologist, whatever he might think; he's a traveler, a gossip gatherer, and a free spirit, but all this has little to do with archeology. I enjoyed his open-mindedness, and the relativism with which he judges most of the theories and hypotheses considered. Going through his whole opus, I can't help noticing that this writer is a really great guy, and that his travel companions and friends must have been lucky to have met him, but archeologist? Please, give me a break. And use some proofreader, for the next edition."
positive,Ben Webster: This is the cd that started my love for Ben. I have listened to it a million times over the past 15 years. It's just GREAT.
negative,"another nickelodeon knock off: this game is just like all the other nickelodeon games; bad graphics, too many codes and pointless goalsi was stupid enough to buy it without renting it from a video store first. just as i did with 5 nickelodeon game boy games that were way overpriced. please dont be as stupid as i was...i suggest you DO NOT buy it."
negative,"Movie better than the Book: I have to say for the first time in my life the movie is way better than the book, it is totally disjointed and full of unnecesary profanity. The author comes across as very immature and a total whiner. Don't bother buying it, the movie is much more enjoyable."
positive,"Galloping adventure fantasy that keeps it's momentum: The Eragon series - now a Quadrilogy (sorry - no other word for it) is galloping adventure fantasy that keeps it's momentum from go to whoa and once your brain locks into that world it's hard to drag yourself away. Doesn't go emotionally deep like Lord of the Rings, just solid action done well."
positive,"A good book that gets old fast: 1984 is a great book. It really makes you think. thee plot is a very interesting one about a dictator ruining everything, but the scary part is they have so much power you can't say anything against their party. This book is very good for those epeople who like to really think about things and take them deep. I would not recommend this title for action fiends."
positive,"If this is his daughter, He needs to empty the Gene Pool.: It's a 60's movie, it's made as well as it couyld have been made for the time, it fares much better them some of the other Frankenstein knockoffs that have been made with the likes of Jesse James or others.It's NOT oscar material, nor is it terrible, it's just an entertaining movie to me, it takes me back to the CHILLER THEATER days where I first saw it.Check it out, you really can't go wrong for 10 bucks."
negative,"Not really helpful tool: Product name is misleading twice - it is not high precision because one has to get really close to the skin, even then and the hair will not be cut close to the skin. Trimming is difficult with it because hair is not captured in the nozzle and knife in a swift way as with previous tools I used."
positive,"Very inciteful: I had rather low expectations since this was a free kindle book, but I gave it a try. I found myself captivated and enriched. Hezekiah is one of my favorite characters because he represented a person devoted to God in the midst of a people far from God. This book gave me much greater insight into what he faced and how the nation of Judah was politically, socially, and religiously during that time. It was a great read and I highly recommend it whether you are a student of OT history or not. It was hard at times to keep in mind that this was a novel. The historical setting is vivid and I believe it to be based on solid historical research. Enjoy!"
positive,"Last sips enjoyed at last!!!: I have read bad reviews of this product and I think the expectations weren't reasonable!What this warmer does is give me back the bottom inch of my coffee, which I've never finished because I can't stand lukewarm coffee. The top half is always piping hot, but I suck that down right away anyway. This warmer keeps the bottom of my mug ready to drink when I get to it.I got jewelry for Christmas and I love it, but this is the best gift that will truly keep on giving.If you want your full drink to stay piping hot for any time, I suggest don't pour it til you're ready to drink! If you want a place to set your coffee that will keep you sipping hot coffee to the bottom, this is your product!!!!!"
positive,"1984 review: The book 1984 by George Orwell, was a great book if you are into Sci Fi/adventure novels. The only part of the book I did not like was the ending. Winston sells out. Through the whole book he has you believe he secretly wants to disobey and rebell against this opressive leadership, but then at the end instead of taking the cruel death with pain and honor he sells out. He takes the easy road. It almost makes it seam like the whole book was for nothing. He ended right where he started off. Other than the sell out ending, the book kept my attention and gets a rating of 4 out of 6 on the Rob scale."
negative,"Very few laughs!: Hello World,Misguiding title and cover. Thought it would be like Rolling Kansas or Road Trip, not at all. His parents grow weed, so what! I could barely make it through the entire movie."
negative,i bought it WRONG DVD: ok movie ....... but i know i bought the wrong DVD......... it is ok ..........old movie but ok movie
negative,So-So: I'm not sure why everyone is raving about this. My girlfriend bought this and she was highly disappointed. The metal is very thin and cheap....the stone is also fairly cloudy and it's HIGHLY apparent it's fake. This ring should be priced more like $2.99.
negative,One of the most boring Movies and kiddish movies yet.: This Movie sucked the acting was poor and the jet pack well look at it like this why would a cop need a jet pack a kid of about 6 would think something like that is cool and his new gun was okay but I love the little automatic pistol he used it looked and sounded cool but of course since I liked it that ninga had to cut in half with a super sharp sword take some advise that is good and watch the first one.
positive,"This DVD really helped me: My husband and I were unable to find any classes in our area that would work for us, so we purchased this DVD. We found it very helpful! I loved that I could go back to it and watch certain parts over again to refresh my memory. If we had gone to a class, I wouldn't have had that luxury. Once I went into labor, I knew exactly what to do and I was able to make it without any drugs. The nurses at the hospital were all asking me if I had gone to a class and I told them about the DVD. They said it must have been good because I did everything perfectly. I would highly recommend this DVD!"
negative,Julie&Julie: Disappointing read - with all the hype regarding the movie I thought it'd be fun to read before going to the movie. I didn't find the book very interesting. guess i thought there would be more about the trials of cooking Julia's recipes vs about Julie trying to pull a life together. I ended up skipping through to the end just to get the gist of it - and then relieved to move to another book.
negative,"Total disappointment: I was totally disappointed with the book for two reasons. One, it had a different author than the one I ordered. Two, it was tremendously boring. A waste of the little money I did spend to get it."
positive,"this cd is tight: Stacie Orrico is Christian's Britney Spears. (Thats not a bad thing though!!). This album is worth the money because this girl can sing. My fave tracks on here are: Ride, O.O. Baby (my fave song!!), Without Love, Genuine, So Pray, Restore My Soul, Confidant, and Dear Friend. The rest of the tracks are so-so. But get her CD anyway, and go get her X-mas album too!!"
positive,"#1 Creating Game: I think Zoo Tycoon is the best building game I have ever played. You can have so many different animals, and even make beaches by combining water and sand. One of the only problems is that the animals reproduce way too fast. I started with 4 lions and ended up with 26! Luckily, you are able too sell your animals. I HIGHLY recommend this game. It is really fun."
positive,"My son loves it: Great language, humor and wonderful story telling are hallmarksof Gerald Durrell's books. Always enjoy reading them. I got thisfor my son on his 11th birthday. I think it will also help himgreatly improve his vocabulary."
negative,"thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high: I thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high.... this was just a waste of my time and money, now I will have to drive to town and get these items so I can get the project done in time!"
negative,"Surprised by other positive reviews: I must say that I am really surprised with the overwhelming positive reviews of this book. I am an avid reader, particularly of historical fiction. This novel felt like a Harlequin Romance novel to me. While I did not learn much about the time period in which it was set, I did learn quite a bit about how to seduce my husband! So, depending on your interests..."
positive,"Best Edition of ESV: The ESV Deluxe in hardback and genuine leather is the bestedition of the ESV in print. I have both the hardback andgenuine leather editions. The hardback is very good andput togther quite well. The leather comes only in blackand looks and feels very nice. Crossway has done a betterjob with this edition of the ESV, but I would love to seeCambridge publish the ESV!The translation itself is excellent for study, preaching,teaching, and devotional reading. It is ""literal"", but notso much so that there is no literary style. The literarystyle is very much in the Tyndale/KJV tradition. This isdue to the fact that the ESV is a slight revision (6% I'mtold) of the RSV. The RSV still remains one of the besttranslations available, but needed some updating.I recommend the ESV Deluxe Reference Edition withoutreservation. Again, it is the best edition of the ESVin print and the ESV is a good translation for study ofthe Holy Scriptures."
negative,Waste of money: This product ended up being a waste of money for me. They didn't fit too well so I ended up just using the original Jawbone ear piece with the these.
positive,"full of information!: I honestly recommend this book, it is helping me to understand what endometriosis is and how to live with it."
positive,"Perfect fit one size smaller: I purchased some Converse Mens Chuck Taylor Sneaker from another store because they had some specials going on and I also had some coupons so I purchased them in the size I have always worn, size 9. Then I try them and wow way too big, felt like a clown at the gym :)I can fit a whole finger in the back of the shoe with my foot in it. Anyway I did some research here on Amazon and bought pair from Amazon, a size 8 and wow !!! I can't believe it Perfect fit, I was about to buy half size smaller but I went with the whole one size smaller instead and I'll say it again PERFECT FIT :)Buy one size smaller ,quality is amazing"
positive,"Must buy for all of us holdover KISS fans: Great overall effort, however, this CD would have gotten 5 stars had some of the songs not seemed so individualized and less like the KISS many of us grew up with. At times it almost seems like Ace and Peter were just brought in to sell more records (say this can't be so). The majority of these songs are very listenable, however, there are a few exceptions. Paul wrote a song for Peter ""I finally found my way"" which I am sorry to say is a weak followup to 'Beth', however, it does have some emotional overtones which were unexpected. Ace recorded better songs than 'Into the Void' on his solo albums. ""You wanted the best"" is about as hokey as it gets. However,with these few exceptions, Psycho Circus is a great CD which I am sure that this will develop into yet another incredible tour. (I took my country music loving wife of 10 years to a show on their last tour and she walked away a KISS fan. OVERALL THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ALL KISS FANS!!!"
negative,"I like the idea, BUT...: As both a surfer and yoga enthusiast i was excited to see this program created, however, upon watching the video it became clear that it's not all that great. It's hard to follow the poses when you can't see the instructors feet b/c they're buried in the sand and unless you have a decent knowledge of yoga there are a lot of important details about many of the poses that are left out. I'd recommend a non-surfing specified yoga dvd over this. You'll get more out of it."
positive,"This is a fascinating glimpse of the past.: So many reviewers have done such a great job in their descriptions that I don't want to rehash the story again. Big whale, little ship, cannibalization, fascinating characters - all great elements to create a compelling story.This is not the typical genre that I gravitate toward, but I found myself unable to put this book down. The descriptions of the whaling society in Nantucket hooked me from page one - and the story just would not let go. I really don't care for gross out books, and to be honest if I had realized how much of that was in this novel, I would have passed it over. That would have been a mistake."
negative,"very bad movie/DVD quality: I've been studying South Asia so I thought I'd watch some movies by people in the region. The movies arrived quickly but the sound quality is terrible and the DVDs themselves skip and get stuck on my computer, my parents' DVD player, and every other DVD player you put them on. The movies themselves have great storylines and music, but the DVDs are really poor quality."
positive,"A GREAT book by RavenWolf: I am a long-time reader of various Witchcraft books. I have read RavenWolf's previous books and enjoyed them though a lot of people refer to her a ""fluffy."" Her new book ""Solitary Witch"" is an unbelieveable resource! It is one of the most impressive, researched books I have seen in a long time! HIGHLY reccomended!"
negative,"Buyer beware!: This DVD is a cheap copy of a great film. I bought this DVD thinking it was a remastered copy of the original, and I was greatly disappointed. Most of the scenes are too dark to see anything, and it repeats in several locations during the film. Do not waste your money on this. If you want a good copy of this movie, make sure to buy the one with the WB logo on the cover."
negative,Doesn't Last: Quit working after about a dozen uses over nine months. I got a total of maybe two hours out of it. A waste of money.
positive,"Barnyard is Best Boynton Book!: We (my one year old) daughter and I love the Barnyard Dance! She actually started liking the book when she was about 9 months. I borrowed it from the public library, thought it was the best Boynton book ever and asked for it for Christmas. The number two choice, in my opinion is ""One, Two, Three."""
negative,3rd Secret is a waste of time: True the first 64 chapters are an interesting read but then you get to the end of Chapter 65 and finally read the Third Secret of Fatima you waited all these pages to see you want to toss this book in the trash! I finished it today and I couldnt help but think this author finished the entire book and then inserted a few paragraphs of very badly written political agenda items and attributed them to the Virgin Mary. You honestly go huh?? They are so out of place and farfetched. Dont waste your money. Its not 1/1000000th as good as the Da Vinci Code.
negative,"Rusty: This item was rusty when I got it. I got it as a gift, but obviously couldn't give a rusty hammer as a gift."
positive,"Harlemm Lee aka Gerry Woo: The problem with Harlemm Lee's lastest cd is the same as his first album, the material. Harlemm has a great voice maybe Broadway or Las Vegas would better suit his talents. His 1st album ""Listen to my Heart Beat"" came out in 1987. There was a local talent tv show on CH.4 in Detroit back in the day forgot the name of the show been awhile. He was the people's choice. Harleem went by the name Gerry Woo. Same singing style and everything of course he had more hair. The best song on the 1st album was a cover of ""Hey There Lonely Girl"". There were three other good songs on the first album ""How Long"", ""Almond Eyes"" and ""Help Yourself"". I think he would be better off doing gospel. I was one of the few people to buy the first album Amazon has it at zShops."
negative,"This is Crap!!!: I purchased four boxes of this brand...I will be returning 3!! The one box I am forced to keep, I will need to add another layer plastic of some sorts! This product does not work well! The quality of the tape is a JOKE! The scotch tape my children use for their arts and crafts projects is at least 50% stronger. I am very disappointed in the results I have experienced and would not recommend this brand if it were to only option on the market. Just to make the plastic stick, I have had to use packaging tape! In the process of using the packaging tape, I have ripped the cheap plastic...an all around mess!! Do not waste your money on Frost!"
positive,"Compression Shorts: I signed up for track recently and some other guy sugested that I get some compresssion shorts, so i did. they gave me a lot of support for practice and meets. There are no locker room problems with these. They are really comfortable and snug and give that male support needed.i've noticed that it sort of shows you're pubes through the fabric sometimes, but other than that they are wonderful; i wear them still even after track season."
negative,"Don't be fooled. Save your money.: I purchased the Better Sex Videos with my boyfriend because we were looking for something new for our relationship. Well I purchased this DVD with their Sexual Positions For Lovers - Beyond the Missionary Position.What a mistake. When the DVD arrived I noticed that the couples are not attractive (turn off for both of us), the quality was terrible, and the information provided was basic information that everyone knows. As for the positions, they are general positions that anyone knows.This company claims that they have sold 4 million videos. I wonder how many returns they have gotten out of those 4 million.I would give this and the Sexual Positions For Lovers - Beyond the Missionary Position zero stars if I could. Don't be fooled. Save your money.If you are looking for a great sex position DVD, try: Sex Essentials Videos: Seductive Sex Positions. Also another great DVD (for the females out there) is Female Masturbation : Every Woman's Orgasm is Unique."
negative,"Just don't like it...: When DD was first born I used Pampers Sensitive and I absolutely loved it. I've tried Costco brand, Pampers, and Huggies. I thought I would go back to Pampers since I had such a good experience with it. This Baby Dry line just doens't work for us. The diaper feels overly moist after she goes number 1, and it doesn't actually seep through, perse, but it feels a little moist and it's not a very pleasant feeling. But one pro is that it's thin so it's very portable. Other than that it was a big BUMMER for us :("
positive,"A GRIPPING AND INSPIRING HISTORY: IN THE HEART OF THE SEA by Nathaniel Philbrick tells the tragic and amazing story of the Essex, a Nantucket whaler that sank after being rammed by a mammoth sperm whale in the South Pacific in November of 1820.If the story of the whale attack and loss of the ship weren't enough, the harrowing tale of how the crew attempted to make it back to New England through the open sea in nothing more than open whaleboats, while experiencing everything from shark attacks to cannibalism, has to be one of the most gripping and inspiring tales ever recorded.Philbrick is masterful in his treatment of the story from start to finish. Drawing upon journals and writings of survivors--used in their day to inspire Herman Melville's masterpiece, Moby Dick--Philbrick offers a concise historical narrative."
negative,"worst paper feed ever: It looks great, lcd screen with media card slots was nice touch..but what good is it if it can't take in any paper to PRINT ANY THING OUT ...I was able to get it to take in paper using exclusive HP paperand ONE PAPER at a time it works SOME TIMES.My first HP printer and it will be my LAST,when I run out of Ink on the darn thing, rather thanburning 60 bucks for INK I would buy a LEXMARK again."
negative,"Not as helpful as Lonely Planet: I recently took a trip to Europe and needed 3 language books. I had Lonely Planet books for French and Italian then bought this book for German. I was really disappointed in this book after having used the Lonely Planet books prior. The menu translator, in particular, is lacking. I could hardly find anything from the menu in this book...and I went to Oktoberfest. I'm sure the food served was traditional German food so why wasn't it in the book? Next time, I'll stick with Lonely Planet."
negative,"lord of the flies: I hate this book. It was by far the worst book ever. The book could easaly be 10 pages but it was like 300 pages. The book was so slow. The book had to much detail, I had no idea you could have too much detail.I would never recommend this book to anyone. My little tip to the auther is to never write another book. I would rather read cifford the dog.The whole plot of the story is the same as ""Lost"" so that is kind of cool. The book was with kids so it made the book more intresting but not by much. I felt reading this book is a punishment. So don't read it."
positive,"my favourite book of all time: Dune was the first science fiction book I read, and 10 years later, it is still very much my favourite book. Don't be discouraged by the first 50 pages, it does get better once one has acclimatised himself to the language of Dune. Herbert does not try to impress with scientific jargon, instead he creates a fantastic political arena and a detailed eco-system that is totally convincing and dazzling. One reading of this book does not do it justice. Nor do any of the sequels. This is science fiction at its best, and I have yet to find anything else of the same standard."
negative,"works only at times: This product seems to work whenever it feels like it. Loses connection often and is really slow. I had trouble updating my Tivo with this. Ended up just connecting it to the internet directly. Although that meant having the TV at a different location than I wanted, it just wasn't worth the hassle."
negative,MAJOR LET-DOWN: After buying a BIG BAD VODOO DADDY cd this was nothing. If you want swing get a BBVD cd and hold on tight.
positive,"James Lee Burke: Burke is a master at language. Most of his characters have depth and humor. Even those you dislike, and believe me there are a few. And he writes a hell of a mystery. Love him.Ceré"
positive,"Worth Every Penny!: Buying this book is one of the most intelligent investments a person can make. The techniques Dr. Win Wenger presents gave me access to that insightful part of my consciousness that I could never reach through my own attempts. Consequently, life is more meaningful (no matter how trite this sounds) since I observe more relationships between things. For less than twenty dollars this is quite a value!"
positive,"Fantastic!!!: This item is great! Very clear instructions/illustrations and explanations for use. Light, compact, waterproof. Covers all the most useful knots and then some. Get this, it's a no brainer."
negative,"Sucks: Worst of the worst. Looks awfull, adds bulk and scartches your ipod by allowing dust to get IN THE CASE. Don't waste your money."
negative,"STOP! BACK AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE...(its for your own good): Date Movie? More like a horrible blind-date movie. Instead of buying this movie, go buy all of the movies that this one spoofed. Because this movie is just incredibly dumb...(I was trying to think of a better word for it, but there is none) TRUST ME, if you are a fan of movies at all...don't watch this one, because it will turn you off of others for a while."
positive,"Satan's Life: I actually found Satan's Wife (USA) (DVD title) (1979) film quite entertaining by distracting my attention from what burdens or distresses me (Old Latin, seafood, pending legislative activity and George Walker Bush). Had anyone other than John Phillip Law (Danger: Diabolik! ) played the role of the Exorcist, I think this film would have collapsed.The plot has more than its share of weaknesses, which is common among films involving Italian Exorcist rip-offs (especially those containing Satanists, occultism and Female nude scenes) --seriously, just go back to the day before it all occurs and deprive Satan of power!) and it dragged on a bit towards the end, which I found very unsatisfying. It's still worth a look if you're in a demonic possession mood but it's more Italian devil scandal than Exorcist.Maybe in the 70's it was a good Exorcist-copy film but not now, now it's just late '70's shoddy devil madness."
negative,Replacement Battery: This extended life replacement battery does not last as long as the old battery it replaced.
positive,"Not a significant improvement: I was going to buy this disc because I had lost my previous copy and was looking forward to the improvements. It is still a great album, which has been made better but there is still plenty of noise on the disc so it not remastered to modern quality. If you don't have it is a great buy if you do have it well this isn't worth the upgrade."
negative,"Dull: I tend to agree with some minority reviewers that this book is boring and dull. It has some interesting thoughts here and there, but that is all. All in all, the book is quite over rated."
negative,Feels like cheap junky plastic.: Photo looked like stainless steel but it is very light plastic. And my handy son gave up on installing it for me.
negative,"Waste of money: There's nothing worse than a bunch or overweight middle aged men trying to go back to their party days. This is pure trash, if you want KISS, go to LICK IT UP. Their BEST CD ever. This is forgettable music."
negative,"It's never too late to write a ""self-improvement"" book: Half the book (literally) is quotes. The rest, a bunch of touchy-feely, quite unmitigated flapdoodle. In my opinion, anyways. Considering how easily and cheaply quotation dictionaries can be had these days, I'd say, go to the source <g>, and just get one."
positive,coin pouch: I had been looking for this exact coin pouch and was thrilled to finally find it. My husband has had one like it before and really liked it. So I bought three for the men in my family. We really like it. I hope you will find it as good as we do.
negative,"Was this necessary?: I guess they will put out a greatest hits album for about anybody now. This ""supergroup"" put out 2 albums and really had only one big hit in ""High Enough"". It is here and there are a few other good tracks, but nothing to write home about. This is the work that Tommy Shaw did after his first falling out with Dennis DeYoung and it has influenced him ever since. this band is a major reason why STYX is without DeYoung and the joke of the classic rock world today."
negative,"This compilation befuddles me.: This compilation befuddles me.The sound is a bit muffled on the tracks listed as 2000 remastered when compared with the John Denver's Greatest Hits.Not all tracks are 2000 remastered. Calypso and I'm Sorry are listed as 1975. They sound and look like the same files as Denvers's Greatest Hits when brought into audacity editing software.It also seems the 2000 remasters are not the original arrangements.I have both this ""Best of Rocky Mountain"" and Best of Volume 1 & 2.The Rocky Mountain version does dull or soften Denver's voice. Some may like that.But if dulls the instruments.I prefer the Best of Volumes. They are sharper with more detail to the instruments."
negative,I LOVE this movie wish it wasn't all whispered though: I LOVE this movie! BUT! The sound really does suck. It's all whispers and no matter how loud you turn it up you only get whispers. UNLESS you have surround sound as I have just learned. Surround sound makes it sooooo much better you can actually hear it!
positive,"Transdescent!!!!!: I am in 9th grade and I am 15 years old, but there is something you do not know about me. I was recently touched by means of words in merely a book. No more than three weeks ago I finished this book, and I must admit that while reading the book, it did not grasp me. Yes, it was able to keep me engaged in the novel and continue reading, but it was not my favorite. That is just the begining. The last chapter touched me in a way I could never imagine possible. Even though I did not rate this five stars, I am sure many of you would. I am sure many of you would rate this ten stars if given a chance. There is so much for one to explore and ponder within this novel, it is fraught with questions. I believe this book can not be missed and I do not usually say this, because I am one to believe that not all people have the same taste for books, as all people do not have the same taste for chocolate, and I recomend this to everyone. The themes are as thick as crunchy peanutbutter."
positive,Happy Niece: My niece was so happy with this flick that she actually watched it 5 times before she called (via mom) to thank me. Definitely a success with the 5-year old crowd.
negative,"Voivod sounding like Exodus?: I gave this record a few listen and unfortunately it was not to my liking. This album is NOT what Voivod is supposed to sound. Eric Forrest brought in a ""death metal"" like voice into the band, Piggy and Away composed most of the music. This album is kinda like a re-hash on 'War and Pain' with all the ""death metal-esque"" vocals and has very poor mix. The mix sounded like all the guitars, bass and drums are overlapping Eric Forrest's vocals. You can bearly hear him singing. This album is pretty sloppy to my liking. Eric Forrest's singing is unlike Snake and his bass techniques are unlike Blacky. His techniques are not bad, but not great either. It's NOT what Voivod should have sounded like on this album. True Voivodians would be disapointed."
positive,"Got to know Sawyer Brown: I've heard Sawyer Brown sing for years but I've never really listened to him, until the video 800 pound Jesus. He has an incredible voice. This CD has been in someone's player ever since I bought it. The whole family has really enjoyed it. This was my first Sawyer Brown CD, but not my last."
negative,"Big Brother is Watching!: George Orwell's book 1984 is a wonderful book set in England's future if WW II never stopped. The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party. In the end it doesn't turn out how he expects it to be but was inevitable.The book was a great read and a good use of time. I personally think big brother is the man. Even though it was a school assignment to read it was great."
negative,"Not a book for beginners: I bought this book for my first PHP college class. I had only dabbled in PHP, so I was in no way ready for this book. While the book is very large, it fails to go indepth for explanations. I tend to learn well by a book staying with a program and going through into detail what to do and then expanding on that program throughout. This book is only useful for referencing."
negative,"Wasnt worth: I bought a pink rubber squeem which had a seperate cotton cloth . That worked well, but i wonder why i dint buy the same and ended up with this. This product hurts me on my left hip and i got scars on my left hip.. :("
negative,"Disappointing: The pieces that attach to the shower wall are very small. Because of this, the rod never stays in place!!"
positive,"Extreme Terror: One of the sickest and disturbing films I have ever watched. I live kind of close to the place where this film took place, so I can really relate to the surroundings. I was in shock after watching this film, perfect for a great scare."
positive,"Florence at its best: This book gives the reader a history of Florence through its art. Naturally, the Florence in the time of the Renaissance is covered at length, but Levey doesn't stop there. He gives lots of insight into the patronage of art in succeeding periods. Levey's portrait of Florence is also a portrait of the Medici family and their artistic legacy to the city.While this book might be too hefty and too heady for the casual italophile, it should be in the library of every hard-core Italy lover."
negative,"Really?: OK. Short and Sweet. Basically I needed a SPECIFIC book to read over summer for my english class. TRUSTING the seller, I ordered there book, which gives the specific kind of book because there are many many versions, and I needed this one. SO I order it, even get the fast shipping because I needed it in a week or so...they sent me a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT version from what i ordered. ON TOP OF THAT THE SELLER DOES NOT RESPOND TO MY EMAIL SO I CANT RETURN. THEN I HAD TO GET ANOTHER BOOK. SO THANK YOU. MAKE SURE TO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. NEVER. THEY WONT GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY'S WORTH. (THE SELLER : any_book)"
negative,RETURN TO SENDER: BORING TALE - EXPECTED SOMETHING BETTER FROM THIS FILM BUT I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS MORE DEEPLY AND NOT ORDERED IT
negative,this movie ok: this movie had to many twist and turns and hard to fallow alot of the time you was wondering what is going on
positive,"Taste wonderful: If you use the soybeans to make soymilk, you would love it. The taste is just what I like . Try it."
positive,"Her finest novel: Though Persuasion is my sentimental favorite, I regard Emma as Austen's finest novel overall. She is at the top of her game and everything works: the dialogue, character development and, did I mention, the humor? While teaching Emma in my AP English class this year, I realized that many less talented readers read right over the irony and scathing remarks. Jane Austen is so very funny that she makes better readers out of those who take the time to read her carefully. I have to admit that the movie version of Emma with Emma Thompson is quite good and does the novel some justice. It also helps a first time Austen reader get a flavor for how things looked and sounded in this time period. If you haven't yet started to enjoy Austen, pick up Emma and you won't be disappointed."
positive,Rush DVD Review: This DVD is exceptional. It gives you background information on the members of RUSH. It is very well put together & a must have for all RUSH fans.
positive,Enjoyable: I was glad to read a novel set in south India since there are not too many novels out there. My favorite part was reading about the patriarch - Solomon's story at the beginning of the book. I could picture my great-grandfather on his land in Kerala. I really enjoyed the story until the last 100 pages or so. It became wordy a tad boring in those last few chapters. All in all I enjoyed the book and thought the author did a great job of telling the story of a family spanning 3 generations. It would have been great to see a photo of a blue mango somewhere! Good - but not a Great debut novel.
negative,TiVo TCD649080: Bought this product after hooking it up I found out you need a telephone jack behind your tv to plug in a phone connection which would tie up my phone line while the TiVo calls to get the tv programing schedule in your area. I sent it back. If the specs would have informed me ahead of time I would not have purchased this product.What a hassle. Shipped it back.
positive,"Rocked: This review is going to be sweet and short.Read this book, buy it, suggest it to others.In other words, this is my way of saying that you rock, Paolini!This is my favorite book of all time.READ it!"
positive,"Matter of personal preference: Although I enjoyed the novel, I believe it is really a matter of personal preference. If you like this kind of books that don't take place in our century and are common to Austen's style (that is, long and elaborate expositions and extensive character development), then Emma is a perfect read. However, if those books are not exactly what you enjoy, then it would no longer be as captivating for you."
negative,"Engine Room Starboard: I borrowed a teammate's copy of this book and was disappointed. I would agree Ms. Hall has certain gifts as a writer and I'm sure journaling this was therapeutic for her, but I think I'd like to read her husband's account as well - like the old saying goes, it takes two to tango. Fortunately most gen x women finally understand that economic self-sufficiency & having one's own career is the way to go from the beginning (i.e., to avoid dependence on another)."
negative,"one star and one jump: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I jumped once, but that doesn't make a scary movie. The first half of the film, nothing happens.. they all meet up, try to appeal to the male crowd by being all female, and you have all the typical characters. The know-it-all, the one with a bad past, the cocky one, etc. The reason this is not ""intense"" is that you see the creatures completely, they look like naked people that are all greasy (it's not a sexy as I just put it). and even the ending... spoiler... you don't know if she sees her friend who either somehow, impossibly made it out, or she is seeing it in her head, like she was doing throughout the movie. This is not even worth renting at the store."
positive,"Hmmm....: Probably the most significant book I have ever read. That doesn't say a lot but hey I never like the bible. For some its almost petty to the number of polished novels and books already on the market and waiting for you pocket book. I must say though, this is quite the exquisite example of whats possible in our world or reality to get metaphyiscal. Many of the writes or teachings of castaneda are just that but this book to some is a starting point from which to begin the journey. The not-doings and small samples are just a small example for what in it. I highly recommend this book for anybody. Maybe you'll get hooked maybe not. Either way, some may care to read it."
negative,"Dumb and Dumber and Dumber and: Six macho bisexual chicks go caving and find blind creepy underground things.Hey girls, don't be so cheap and rent a guide who has done that cave before...duhhh.It's hard to feel sorry for dumb and dumber and dumber and...."
negative,"nice film, wrong ratio: Four stars for the film, no stars for the DVD. What I absolutely do not get is why this film is presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The theatrical release was widescreen; the DVD should at the very least contain the film in it's original form. A missed chance."
negative,"Belongs in the fiction section: I worked on the trading floor (a few desks from Jett) at Kidder-Peabody during the scandal and nothing in the book remotely resembles the environment he describes.Compensation on Wall Street is BASE SALARY + BONUS. Your base salary has a maximum value (for Managing Directors at the time it was probably 150K to 250K)His much-hyped 8 million dollar bonus...was COMPLETELY discretionary! They could have paid him ANYTHING and he had absolutely no recourse except to quit.So....why would Kidder pay him ALL that money ONLY to take it back? Because they were all racists?????? Why go through all that trouble!Joe Jett had access to the head of Fixed Income 24/7....he was always in his office, no one treated him disrespectfully (he had the audacity to claim the Admin staff dissed him?????)Folks...if the writing weren't so long-winded, pretentious and over-baked the book would make a great fiction thriller."
positive,Love it!!: It was everything it was advertised to be. I'm going to get another one!!! Got so many compliments at the party that I wore it to. Made my outfit look really great!!
positive,A great Help !: I did crochet a long time ago and i forgot a lot 1This book helped me to regain my ability to create through crochet!Very good answer to the many questions I had !
negative,"not good quality: The quality of this item was not up to expectations.The Top was scratched, the hinges did not line up to the pre-drilled holes and the staining was inconsistant. If I saw this item in a store I would not have purchased it."
positive,GREAT ADDITION!: Excellent protection. Blends in great with the current rugand upholstery. Should have purchased a long time ago.Well worth the price!
positive,"Even after 40 years, still one of the best SF stories.: I first read this book almost 40 years ago and I still enjoy revisiting Kip, Peewee and the Mother Thing every few years. As a celebration of American values and great storytelling, ""Have Spacesuit, Will Travel"" has few peers. Although it is considered one of Heinlein's ""juveniles,"" this book is enjoyable by young and old alike."
positive,"oldie but GOODIE: Wonderful reading for any agegroup. While not required, it's a good introduction to the Ring Cycle. Can't wait for the movie to be released on DVD."
positive,"Good quality, perfect temperature: I bought this to keep my tea and coffee warm while I work at my desk for extended periods of time. The power cord is a decent length, so that I can plug it into my power strip on the floor and fit the cup warmer on the corner of my desk. It keeps beverages the right temperaure--not lukewarm, not scalding hot. Just hot enough to drink without fear of burning your tongue.Has an on/off switch which is nice, you don't have to unplug the device for it to stop heating.Would have preferred to power it through a usb cable though, so that I can really take it everywhere with me!"
positive,Interesting and entertaining: I bought this piano for my granddaughter as she was so fascinated with it in the store. Her mom has a piano and keyboard at their house and reminded me of this. I said I did not have one at my house so that is where we put it. My granddaughter is 13 months old and loves it. She likes to flip the page to change the tune. She especially loves banging on the keyboard to make the music play.I counted 8 tunes: 4 classical and 4 folk/nursery tunes.She really enjoys dancing along with the music.And I have fun making my own tunes and chords with the 8 note keyboard.It is easy to assemble (I did it myself).The only concern is the seat: I think it should be a little wider with a backrest for the baby. Otherwise it is a great instrument.
positive,"Works better than Footsmart: This is way more comfortable and works better than the footsmart one. The plastic on the footsmart one rubs, where this one is soft and comfortable."
negative,"Unbelievably disappointing: I expected a great deal from this movie. I was overwhelmingly disappointed. It gets one star because I HAVE to give it at least one star, there's no option for '0 star'.I am a huge U2 fan, but the music was downright dull. It all sounded like the same song over and over again, and as the person I was watching the movie with stated, it was filled with Bono's masturbatory musical moments (ie. unnecessary musical vignettes during a scene, lyrics that were dour, dull and pretty much unrelated to the action, etc.)I am a HUGE Mel Gibson fan, and love Jimmy Smits, but both of their performances were mediocre, at best. It surely had more to do with an uninspired (and uninspiring) script than any shortcomings of theirs.I won't give away the big mystery behind Mel's neck brace, but it was the most ridiculous plot twist (if you could call it that?!?) I've ever been subjected to.What a waste of time and money this was. It's a stinker."
negative,Strange fit: I have big legs and legs on this were too big while the waist area too tight even though I followed the instructions. Had to return it.
positive,"Good Movie!: I thought this was a great movie, and for any Will Smith Fan, it is a must see! Very inventive idea, action packed, and will keep you at the edge of your seat!"
negative,Piece - O - Crap: This battery doesn't hold charge for anything. Even my four year old battery that I got with the cell phone STILL holds a charge better than this Piece - O - Crap
positive,New Wave Review: I have had a New Wave filter to remove chlorine on my shower for 1 year. I just purchased a New Wave replacement cartridge for my 2nd year of use. I love that they remind you that it is time to replace the cartridge. I feel I am doing something good for my family with a minimum amount of money. It's worth it.
negative,What ECD?: It is a sad day for music lovers when you get an ad for an ISP each and every time you insert the disk into your computer. Is this supposed to be value added content? Not very suave if you ask me.Music 4 + Advertisements -3 = 1
positive,"Excellent stepping stone to world of SF!: Folks, till foundation happened to me, I had for some inexplicable reasons never got introduced to world of science fiction (SF).(unless you call hitchhikers guide to galaxy as one) Based on influence of the die hard coterie of Asimov's fans, I decided to start my journey with Foundation...........and I have really found it cool stuff............worth reading and excellent investment of time..........since it rejuvenates you with fascinating ideas and terrific narrative. Looking forward to picking up the next one."
positive,great book: This is a classic book that I have always loved and now can read on my Kindle. Glad to see it free!
negative,"Not ""electrifying"" Clay, but ""electrified"" Clay: The most enduring criticism of ""commercial pop"" music is that by the time the producers get done with their electronica and multiple tracking, the singer gets lost in the shuffle. Such is the case here. The Clay Aiken with the dazzling talent and soaring high notes that we loved on American Idol is buried in a sea of ""production"" so that the album becomes another of so many that literally ""anybody"" could have sung. I guess we'll have to wait until he's proven he can sell enough ""commercial mainstream"" to take the ""risk"" of a ""Broadway"" album, or to sing the the hard-to-sing oldies that he became famous for on AI.Love ya Clay, just not this album."
positive,"Slip Sliding Away: Okay look, this is lubricant...and it lubricates. Whatever you need to lubricate, this will work. Got a squeaky wheel? This will take care of it. Need to slide out of a sticky situation? This will do the job. Need to put a square peg in a round hole? You need to go see a doctor if you got a square peg."
negative,"its alright: most of this movie is flashbacks from the first one.delightful, but why did they even bother making this one? i mean wouldn't you rather just watch the first. its a lot better. i mean, this one is kind of good, it has its momments, but the best scenes are lifted right from the origenal. i baught this for a buck at a video game rantal store. it was worth it- but if your going to rent this just rent the first one again. its better"
negative,"Poorly plotted and pictured and definentely not worth it.: The movie has a good story, but they messed it up with their begginig and silly end. It's definetely NOT worth it."
negative,"An Unusual Twist on Cinematic Time Travel That Doesn't Seem to Understand Itself: An odd twist on time distortion in which, due to the inexplicable appearance of the aurora borealis over Queens, a New York cop is able to communicate via ham radio with his long-dead father thirty years in the past. Completely ignoring the warnings of Doc Brown and Marty McFly, he immediately spoils the upcoming World Series and dozens of important life moments for his father, before the two decide to pair up in search of an unresolved string of historical murders. The film can't decide if it wants to do the sappy paternal bonding thing or follow a more suspenseful path, and its main plot mechanism is clunky, under-explained and inconsistent. It's also routinely telegraphed from beginning to end, with a narrow scope limiting its potential escape routes and an overdose of father-son baseball allegories. Hackneyed, hammy and haphazard, it plays like a bloated sci-fi short story in desperate need of revision."
negative,"A very disappointing book...: I had high hopes when first picking up this book. I had seen it before on the shelves, before the movie previews started on TV, but I passed it up. After seeing how cute the movie looked and seeing it was a film by Nora Ephron, the woman behind the great films Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, then I decided to give it a try. I started to read the book, got into it, maybe 50 pages in thinking, ""This is cute, I think I'm going to like this."" I then started reading further into it and was very disappointed. Not only was it very long and boring, but the author has the tendency to not translate the meaning of what she's cooking, since all of the recipes have French names. Bless you if you can get through this book. I am an avid reader and usually will read almost anything but this wasn't something I could. Watch out for another book she has coming out in December called 'Cleaving', a more detailed of the same story told in this book."
positive,Good low budget film: If you take it in stride you may find this movie very entertaining. This movie does have gooding acting in it by all of the cast members and has star power.
positive,SpongeBob Squarepants Movie: My two boys love watching Spongebob Squarepants so I thought I'd buy the movie to add to their dvd collection and they enjoy watching it.Great movie for any Spongebob fans.
positive,"This book would take your breath away: I am glad that I read this book, this book has all the elements needed to entertain a person and I couldn't put the book down. The relationshop between Angel and Buffy is so well written and it is a good novalisation of 'Halloween','What's my line pt 1 and 2'."
positive,Nice value tent: Easy set up overall. Wish the bottom was lined with tarp instead of nylon.Good roomy ceiling. Plenty of room for air mat and family of 4.
negative,"What a complete waste of time: This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long-long time. The plot is very unimaginative, and is active is plain horrible.There isn't much more to say."
negative,"talking head, talking bunk: This is like those ""tutorials"" you find for computer programs: after the satisfied customer stumbles through it, they know nothing.If you read books like a goat eats dead grass, leaves, old paper and discarded rubbers, you'll read this, too, probably.If you want to rip people off, go out and find a certified con man. Do time. This guy just burns up his word processor and your money.""Get rich quick. Buy and sell real estate"". NO! Publish junk!"
positive,"Great job on this one: I was a bit disappointed with Ark of Truth. The actors did a great job, but there were too many gaps in the story. This, however, was a really, really good film. It was fantastic to see so many people brought back for this one. The special effects were great, and the actors did a great job, too.It wasn't perfect, however.People vanishing from an altered timeline... That just doesn't happen. There are infinite possible universes out there, and when travelling through time, you create a new branch. You don't destroy things in the parallel universes. It's a fundamental part of the Stargate universe.Ignoring that, however, the film is terrific. If you need your SG-1 fix, with plenty of action, special effects, and cast members, this delivers. Great job by everyone.Sci-fi Channel, Please make more!Everyone else, Please buy this so they will!"
positive,Bill Engvall is more like 100 degrees ON cool!: Bill Engvall videos are almost always a good bet to be funny. 15 degrees Off Cool does not let you down! His vivid comedy leaves you in stitches throughout the entire show! This video is worth your time and money!
positive,"Breath of embalming powder!: This movie has it all. Necro-love, murder mayhem, gore, decent acting, and a creepy feel. Great flick!"
negative,"Hated this book ...: If you've read anything else, don't get this book. The information in here is SO general that it could be applied to just about anything. The book lists quick explanations of what will happen, but no information on how to respond to what you'll experience. Additionally, there were frightening statements in this book letting me know the author was no expert on the subject of baby rearing. I was exasperated to read her thought that babies should usually be placed in the backseat of the car. I think that everyone knows that is the ONLY place to put a baby in the car. Though, I'm afraid unknowledgeable people will read this book and think it's ok to do such things as put a baby in the front seat of the car.If you've read ANYTHING else, you don't need this book. In fact, if you haven't read anything else, you still don't need this book. Don't waste your time or money."
negative,"T(een)P(orn)-2.com: Another bad album by the Pete Townsend of R&B. If you love R&B, then you'll probably dig this...but for me, R&B has no place in my album collection, especially an R&B album by a child molester. I gave him 2 stars cuz he's a good singer."
positive,"Good, But Roller Coaster Tycoon is Better: This Game allows you to create your own zoo, with lots and lots of different kind of animals, exibits, shops, and more! The Scenarios are allright, and the animals look really realistic! I would reccomend getting the double expansion pack also, so you can have water animals and dinosaurs in your zoo too. You can also download different animals and scenery on the original one, and put them in your zoo. It is pretty obvious Zoo Tycoon is competing with Roller COaster Tycoon. So if you buy this, get the double expansion pack with it or later, and the game will be well worth the money."
negative,"country? pop?: I was very dissappointed in this cd, its not country, its not pop,, its that boring awful 'new country',, the arrangements and mixing is as well, bad,, i couldnt figure out why til i read the credits and lee ann thanks mca for letting you do what she wanted basically with the music, well sorry lee ann, stick to singing, there are one or two good songs on it,, the rest is not stuff you want to listen to,, its too busy,, the song writing oh yes, is poor,,,"
negative,"sugar coated tripe: This is a farce and dishonor to Halloween. Part of it are true, but then it seems like it gets dipped in a sugary mess. Only good thing is it was a free book."
positive,"Historic romance: This offered everything I've come to expect from this author. History, relationships and message of strength and love all packaged together. Enjoy this chick pick on a good night with a glass of wine - indulge yourself!"
positive,"Joseph entertains wonderfully!: I ordered this video to use as a wrap-up for a unit I was doing on musicals with my 3rd and 4th graders. They really enjoyed watching it and absolutely loved the music. For many, this was their first exposure to a musical. There were some parts where the women were very ""scantily clad"", and that, of course, got a big reaction out of them - I reassured them that the actresses were wearing costumes to make them ""look like they're not wearing anything."" Even being a pro actor myself, I have little criticism for this video."
negative,This book Blew the bag Ha Ha By Steve Austin: Who ever wants a piece of me will have to tell me so on this web page and thats the bottom line cause Stone Cold said so
negative,"horrible: this movie was just plain bad. bad story. bad ""gore"". bad everything. don't waste your money or your time watching this."

negative,"HATE THEM. Don't waste your money.: We have always used Pampers for our little boy, despite the price, with great results. When I saw the lower price on the Baby Dry, I was thrilled to pieces and thought it would be a great buy. These are the worst diapers we have ever put on our child. I have to change him much more frequently, I have seen more ""soak through"" episodes (the best was on my lap, in the middle of church), and he is clearly uncomfortable, pulling the diaper away from his skin. We have never had a problem with Swaddlers or Cruisers -- I say, stick with these."
positive,Nice 2 pack: These small trucks are a great addition to my son's sand toy bag. They are not too big to be carted around and my son has been enjoying them for several months without any problems.
negative,"Cropped: I bought this print as a placeholder for when I'd have the funds for a larger, higher-quality print. The colors are dull, sure, but it's expected for such a low price.I was very surprised to see that the piece itself is cropped in a significant way. There are actually scenes missing. This print was $1.39 when I bought it, so I can't complain too much, but it's certainly not worth the price they're asking for now. Whether you're looking for something framed or something cheap, do yourself a favor and make sure you're ordering the complete piece."
negative,"White Robots vs. Will Smith!!!: Will Smith was recently in the news saying that AIDS had been created by White people to kill Blacks. I guess this movie must be his revenge for that.It has little to do with Asimov's classic story. We get the usual cop on the edge who follows his hunches instead of the rules -- GIANT CLICHE!!! -- and then we get these White robots who want to wipe out Will Smith (a sure sign of artificial intelligence as the guys is such a nauseating, smug [supply own expletive]).After this it just descends into action-special-effects Hell as any interest or storyline is squeezed out by Smith leaping around, probably supported by wires, as an army of CGI geeks try to keep up with overambitious and cartoonish special effects -- Crash! Blast! Kaboom! ...Yawn!Nevermind the robots; Hollywood actors, directors, and producers should be programmed with ""the 3 laws of moviemaking"" - characters, story, and meaning. This pointless production breaks all three -- bad robot!"
negative,"Wouldn't recommend: Of the 10 models attempted, I was only able to complete about 5. Thinking it might be me, I had a few friends try. Alas, they too were confused. Definitely not the ""joy"" I was looking for. Even though I purchased this on sale I'll probably return it. If it weren't for the nice paper included in the book, I'd have given it no stars. Maybe this book is good for experienced people but if you're a beginner and looking for a book, I'd keep looking."
positive,TP-2.COM: I think I like this CD better than 12 play. All of his CD's sound good because he puts everything into them. I love this man and the way he ahs changed R&B.
negative,"NON-ANAMORPHIC?!: The Abyss (Special Edition)is not the set that a proper cinephile would appreciate.I was so excited that this DVD was on sale at Best Buy for $9.99 that I immediately bought it. I put it in to play on my widescreen TV to find out that Fox did not set this DVD up to be played on HDTVs! I have to set the picture in a 4:3 image to watch a film that is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.This set is utterly disappointing! I would recommend that everyone wait for this to be released on BluRay. Only then will Fox actually make good on their ""special edition"" promise. At least, I hope they will..."
positive,"Bradbury's Best: Sometimes there seem to be two Ray Bradbury's. On the one hand, there's the writer of Twilight Zone-esque (before the TZ existed!) stories that are exciting or just plain creepy (The Illustrated Man, R Is For Rocket). On the other hand, there's Bradbury the stylist, who can write page after page of poetry in prose form (Dandelion Wine). Not everybody likes both.But in this novel the two Bradbury's meet. His love for boyhood, the beauty of a small town, the love of a father are all captured in gorgeous writing wrapped around a truly creepy tale. The Wonder Years meets Dracula? There's really nothing else like this work: it can stand up right beside To Kill a Mockingbird and a Tales From the Crypt collection.Oh, and whatever you do, don't watch the movie version."
negative,"I can't listen to it again. . .: This album was extremely disappointing. I'm not one of those ""scene"" kids who listens to music because I like the lyrics or because the band members look cute in girl pants, but am a musician with an ear for originality and technicality. To begin with, the sound quality is unbearably bad; the cymbals create a flood of distortion that drowns out everything else, except the kick drum which sucks out the sound of the cymbals. Second, the album sounds completely generic, as if they decided to jump on the talentless overfunded emo bandwagon with the likes of My Chemical Romance and Underoath, even though they have dominated their genre for years. There is neither rythmic technicality nor raw emotion nor screaming(or the screaming was so scarce that I didn't notice it at all). They seem to be marketing to a different group: the trendy scenesters who buy whatever is on the Up and Coming rack at Target for $9.99."
positive,"MaC POWER Adapter: Works fine on the PowerBook G4. Doesn't have an LED to tell you it's on and, of course, doesn't have a smart plug to show charging status."
positive,"Blistering comment on the news media: An also-ran TV network's news operation contributes to a potential catastrophe as it becomes embroiled in a terrorist incident.The late Ed Flanders (St. Elsewhere) stars as a top news executive and anchor who takes to the airwaves and won't let go of live videocam coverage of a breaking story -- even as the coverage contributes to the crisis.Actress Kathryn Walker co-stars as the network's lead female anchor. She performs the anchor role well, conveying intelligence, confidence, emotional investment, and rising doubt as the story spirals out of control.The fictional TV network's fake commercials and low-budget production will have an especially familiar ring to audiences who recall NBC's hard-luck days in the very early 1980s."
positive,"Best diapers by far: We have tried every single diaper with my son, by far these are the best. He is on the chubby side so the expandable waist is great for him. We experience no leaks during the day, but during the night we do get diaper leaks (took away one star for that), so we do use a different diaper at nights."
negative,"Heavy on content but short on motivation: The book did not seem very well thought out as a book in itself. The information within was very minor, and the routines did not seem as ultimate as the cover suggested in achieving the athletic body or performance as Dan O'Brien possesses. The most disturbing aspect was the graphic content inside. Most exercise demonstrations were in pencil sketch. Text was large, as if filling up space, and the design concept at the start of each chapter was too busy. It had the feel of a rushed book, and that Dan didn't even have time to perform the routines himself so drawings were made of him instead; which made knowing how to perform the workouts correctly & safely difficult to gauge. It also lost the personal touch that most books have because I never felt that Dan was actually there with me at every step."
positive,salt lamp: I bought 2 of these for my daughter and her husband to use on their nightstands. I like the soft light that it gives off. I hope they enjoy them.
negative,"A Sad Farewell: I have mixed emotions about this one. Laurel and Hardy fans SHOULD see this one, because it is the last film the boys did.But be prepared, Stan was in poor health at the time. He was a diabetic and suffered terribly during the heat. He was only 60, but looked like death warmed over. The film is NOT typical L&H; comedy, but a poor attmept at political satire. Sorry folks, that just WASN'T the boys style. With poorly dubbed dialog for the non-English speaking performers, it's a little irritating at first. There is still some magic left, like Stan ""burping"" his pet lobster, when he and Ollie take the boat engine apart, only to have the pieces fall overboard and where Stan pours oil over troubled water. I just wish the film had been made when the boys were in better health and could have had more controll. In his final years,even Stan called this film an ""abortion"" True fans of L&H; should remember them in their prime, like ""The Music Box""and ""Way Out West"""
negative,Jogging Through Jell-o: My mother described reading this book like jogging through Jell-o and I am inclined to agree. I attempted to read it due to continually being rated as on of the top 100 novels of all time. I made it 16% of the way according to my Kindle and just couldn't do it anymore. I found it to be difficult to follow and prone to tangents.
positive,"Fits perfectly on my Jawbone headset: I'm using the largest of the 3 sizes of EarGels that came with the shipment and it works great on my Jawbone headset. Just pop the existing earpiece off the Jawbone, fit this on, and you're done. It's comfortable, easy to insert in my ear, and fits snugly which allows me to remove the badly designed ear clip that comes with the Jawbone. The sound is also much better than before.Clever little accessory and highly recommended."
negative,Crazy in Alabama: I ordered this movie and another as region 2 not understandin what that meant. When I received the movie it would not work and I could not figure out why. I emailed Movie Mars they explained but since it ws my fault it was not worth returning. I think they should make a side caption for region two explaining it. If I would have known what it was I would not have ordered it. These were a Birthday gift. I had to reorder the right region so I had to wait and give the gift late. Plus I just threw away the othe movies!
negative,"Lorna Doone: This movie is centered around a doomed love between two young people from bickering families. The movie is extremely slow with the first five minutes showing two people on horseback. There doesn't seem to be anything pulling the movie together to make you want to watch the ending. The basic theme and plot is an excellent storyline, but there is something lacking. Overall, I was expecting a romantic love story and instead found a dull way to spend 2 hours."
positive,"Incomplete. This is a major undertaking...: I happened into a foreign film of theCount of Monte Cristo, and was charmed by it. So I checked Amazon for a written copy. Heavens, it's a 'classic'!It was originally written in French a couple hundred years ago, so you have to depend on a good translation.You may also want to concider an abridged version if lots of details and many words annoy you.It takes place as Napoleon is in and out of power, and the politicos are jumping back and forth with theiralligence. And there is misplaced love, castles, dungeons,luck, no luck etc....and I'm not very far yet! But it does make me want to read on. Ann Cedar Rapids, IA"
negative,"GOD,THIS MOVIE WAS SO STUPID: i bought this movie before i rented it thinking it would have michael myers but after i watched it,i felt like killing myself for even RENTING it! this movie has NO michael myers!it doesnt even have anything to do with any of the halloweens! they really shouldnt of made this movie.do not waste your money or your time watching this movie.skip it"
negative,"I love Tolstoy, but...: I kept waiting for Tolstoy to get off the soapbox, but it never happened. The writing is classic, and the characterization very easy to follow. But the payoff was lacking -- it seemed to me that the book was more interested in making a point (which I think was Tolstoy's object anyway) than actually having a book that provides a true novel experience. I suppose my review expresses my disappointment, as Tolstoy is one of my all-time favorite writers."
positive,Enjoyed this one: Can't help thinking that she could have handled things differently - but it's a good puzzle within a puzzle movie. The acting is good and it does keep you trying to figure out what will ultimately happen.
negative,"Disappointing: I was expecting much more from this video. It did have kids doing poses, but it was hard to find the 13 year-old. Some of the circle games looked like they might be fun. I wanted to show it to my third grade class, but I don't think it would hold their interest. All in all I felt I was watching someone's home video of their family doing yoga."
positive,"Power Adapter for Apple G4: The cord works great. It's not as cool looking as the Apple Adapter and it does not have the light indicator, thats all I can say bad about it. Its $50 less than the Apple one so go buy it."
negative,"Blood everywhere: I typing this with 9 fingers, having nicely cut the 10th while mishandling this massive, unwieldy razor, which I received as a gift. My face has nicks on it for the second day running - corners of the mouth, where it's hard to maneuver this brick. I shave my head as well as my face and frankly this razor scares the heck out of me, it's an unnecessarily complex and overdone gadget brought to you by the company that in the 1960s (and this is a quote from Wikipedia about a well-known fact) ""was accused of exploiting customers by forcing them to buy rust-prone [carbon steel blades]"" because it ""held a patent on stainless blades but had not acted on it"".Thanks Gillette, for putting profit before product and customers. I never had a problem with the Mach 3. Hopefully my finger will heal in a week or so but this razor is going in the trash today."
negative,"Wow, what a letdown: I thought this movie was going to have an incredible plot - All I wanted was to be able to go home and watch a really bad movie. This movie was different. It went beyond the limit of manass. It would have been better with Chuck Norris- 10 TIMES BETTER. ""Sun"" should have had more speaking parts where we could get to know her better. Next time, see Cyborg 2 with Angelina Jolie instead."
positive,"Great Video on Holistic Medicine: My husband is an ND and an African Traditional Healer so I bought him this video for his birthday. He enjoyed it, for me it was a little long and mundane I thought it was more on spirituality. Yet and still, the birthday man was very happy. Anyone in the healing or medical field will enjoy the DVD. It does talk scientifically about how and why the herbs work. I learned new ideas about Tibetan Healing Techniques that are similar to African Traditional Healing. That was helpful for me because I do all the writing for his company and it gave me a new perspective.In conclusion if your interest is in the field this video is helpful."
negative,Major Letdown: This was not the complete series. Editing left a major hole in the story line. I would strongly suggest getting the full length version.
positive,"Good to Have Around: My wife and I found that if your electric blanket goes dead, you can slit it open and pour in some of this powdered ore. It won't be quite the same, but the weight and extra heat will help, if you can keep the powder from collecting at the bottom and side seams. Also, my wife says she no longer needs to use a depilatory. (She hogs the blanket.)"
positive,"best coffee maker in 20 years: This is the best coffee maker that I've had in 20 years. It makes good coffee better and it makes fine coffee great. It can not however make poor coffee beans taste any better, so do yourself a favor and buy the best coffee you can find and enjoy a really good cup."
positive,"Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck: The story took place in Soledad, California during the Great Depression. There were two migrant workers mentioned in this book, George and Lennie. They were best friends. Their relationship symbolizes strong vs. weak. One of them always causes the other trouble. You will think the weak one always causes strong trouble right? But the truth is, the strong guy(Lennie) always causes the weak(George) trouble. Why was that? First Lennie cause tiny problems, then bigger and finally the biggest trouble. Now what and how should the weak one(George) help or save his best friend?I give the rate of 4 stars to this book. It's a great book for love, friendship and at a loss as what to do. The theme of this book is sometimes friends have to force themselves do something that he/she doesn't want to. I recommend this book to those young children and adults who have been lost as to what to do."
negative,Not Very Queen: What can you say? Doesn't even sound like Queen in some places. A bit too much disco. There are a couple of good songs though. But this is my least liked Queen album apart from Flash Gordon sound track.
positive,The Mason Jar Cookie Cookbook: This book is exactly what I was looking for. The recipes and suggestions are very well-explained and easy to follow. I especially like the pre-printed directions to copy. I can't wait to get started on some great Christmas gifts!
positive,"It's About Time!: Finally, a REAL movie. What makes this movie so great is that it tells it like it is. All those fake shows you see on t.v. like Dawson's Creek and Touched by an Angel are bull-. Those shows tell every body how they would like it to be, and not how it really is. The majority of this country has lived or is living the lives of these ""kids"". Even though it may be sad, its true, and it's about time we had a movie everyone can relate to. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or even if you don't want to, you should, because it's a definite eye opener. I would give this movie 8 stars if i could!!"
negative,Couldn't read it: Pics are nifty. Watch Coal Miner's Daughter. Don't try to read this book. I know she was raised in the woods but trying to read like you are illiterate is kinda challenging.
positive,GLADIATOR: This movie is simply... PERFECT. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are oscar winners. This is rhe kind of movies you must see more than once. The more I see it the more I like it. The movie makes sense since the VERY BEGINNING till the end. The music is superbly heartfelt.This movie must be categorized as the best 21st Century Classic.
negative,"What a disappointment!: After reading My Life in France I couldn't wait to read Julie & Julia. I was hoping to read about someone becoming inspired, growing as a person, embracing life ala Julia. Instead the personal account struck me as whiney, self absorbed and uninspiring. What a disappointment!"
positive,"Batman begins to be better than ever: Having watched all of the batman videos, this one is my favorite. The two disc contains the movie and a hilarious 'tankman' spoof on one disc, special features on the other. The special features weren't that spectacular unless you are really interested in all the behind the scenes shooting, a lot of it is the director talking about his plans/ideas for the movie and how they came to be. The building of the batmobile was fairly interesting and filming of some of the stunts, most of it however was just 'filler' to me. I would get the two disc set just for the tankman spoof, which was a great shout out by SNL."
positive,"Couldn't put it down.: I have just returned to the land of the living, having hidden from the world to read all 1276 pages of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" in just under five days. It is definitely my favorite book now, beating out one that has been my top since I was a teenager. You know how you can get through a book, love it, and also be sorry that it's done? Well, with a book of this length, it's as if you read five books that you don't want to end. You get the complete story. Nothing is left out that should have been said. Sheer perfection."
negative,"Another poor EDENBOOK conversion!!: The book is fantastic; Edenbook's sloppy, negligent conversion to kindle is a waste of your time.What Edenbooks does is take a public domain work, run it through a substandard text recognition program, then foist it on the public without so much as a proof read. It is basically one long text file, without chapter headings or Kindle-enabled sections.There are so many typos, many of them confusing grammatical typos that lose sentence ends and, combined with their spelling-check word-swapping, create strange meaningless run-on travesties, that the reading experience is ruined.These guys are parasites on the ebook world, trying to manufacture income from as little work or care as possible, and churning out unreadable garbage that gets good reviews anyway because all the reviewers are reviewing the original work, not Edenbook's incompetance. Amazon should shut them down."
positive,"Good Fun: Bought as a present but everyone had to play with this. Good fun for all, even the adults. Amusing to come back to but can be a bit boring after a while. A good value item with education linked to a toy."
negative,"I can't listen, them........: I understand lowbut,I would like listen BRANT BJORK & OPERATORSIN THIS SITE. IN OTHER TIME, PERHAPS.THANKS"
negative,"Major warehouse club manager told me they CONTINUE to get a ton of returns!: I have a friend who works for a major warehouse club in Los Angeles, I wanted to buy a bunch of this coffee machine, so I asked her to check the returns number, she told me that her return department continues to get a ton of returns on this B-70 model (in Jan & Feb 2012)! I also emailed the manufacturer (several times) for a price break on 10-20 machines of another model with better reviews, they ignored all my emails! Bottom line (for me & many others here): BAD PRODUCT + BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
negative,"Still Don't Know: Been on order since Oct. Received wrong item first. Knife Country says that they sent a second ""package"". Haven't received it yet. Will send them back the wrong items when I return from overseas."
positive,"Great Easy Listening Tunes: This Reunion of two superstars is long overdue in CD form. Every one of the 24 songs is enjoyable. My own favorite is The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. I'm not a big country music fan, but this album should appeal to a wide range of listeners. I've been a Jimmy Webb fan since his work with the 5th Dimension and Richard Harris. His writing is the best, and Glen Campbell's voice has never sounded better. I ordered the CD based on the pre-release mention on the VH-1 special on Glen Campbell and have played it daily since it arrived. It's a real pleasure to hear this great work."
negative,"the movie was better: Usually the book is always better. In this case, no way. I found it to be just a bunch of disjointed ramblings and partial recounts of what happened. I couldn't even finish it and gave it away. The movie didn't follow the book at all, but at least there was a thread of a storyline to follow."
negative,"I didn't understand this book!: I'll admit that this book was interesting, but I didn't know where the author was going with it. I had to read this book for English so I could write a speech about it on whether or not it's a classic. I don't know what I will write since I really don't know what it's themes are. I could not relate to the characters very much. I don't know anyone like these people! What I saw were a bunch of losers who had their problems, but they didn't didn't try to help themselves! Mr. Singer was the most promising character in the book, but he killed himself! I was very disappointed! I guess this book made me realize that I have little problems in comparison to them. Don't read this book unless you are an expert on finding themes!"
negative,Poor Performance: This product sharpens pencils so sharp that they break..hence....the end result is catastrophic and requires purchasing more pencils and using manual pencil sharpeners as opposed to Electric ones. They need to go back to the drawing board for this model.
negative,OVERHYPED MOVIE OF THE YEAR: jennifer hudson can't act but she can act like there is a god giving her awards. eddie murphy lost it. beyonce is a poser. movies like this have been made before and have been made better. its just garbage. we've seen it before. OVERHYPED. watch it again..yeah it's garbage.
positive,"Very good: This is the only magazine I read regularly in college (25 years ago) that I still read now. Great articles on all kinds of issues and they do try to cater to black women from ages 20 to 55 or so which is not easy. Lately, it's been a little flat -- both in terms of magazine size and in the depth of the articles. I'm renewing it one more year and hope it improves during that time"
positive,"excellent book: Bejan's book may look polemic because all the topics in convection heat transfer he had to review, and sometimes correct some ""historically assumed"" mistakes. There is detailed physical explanation of every phenomena. There are very few good books in heat transfer in the market. This is the best."
positive,"a great action movie: Transformers: dark of the moon arguably has the best action compare with its predecessors. However, it does have the worst story compare with the previous two movies. I praised transformers for its phenomenal graphics and computer graphics. It would definitely worth it if anyone is a fan of highly-advance sci-fiction movies."
positive,"Great addition to a fan's collection: One thing that I have learned over the years is that it is very difficult to capture the same energy, audio and visual effects of a live show on a taped performance. Although I wasn't there, I have a feeling that the flat vocals were largely due to that fact. I have been to several live shows that were mind blowing only to see the same performance on DVD and find that the singers sounded like they were in their bathroom singing. I'm a diehard fan of Queensryche and Dio so they can do no wrong. I'm sure that the experience of the show was epic but the DVD left me wishing I was there."
positive,"Fables from India Well Presented.: Pancatantra the ancient book of fables, is an interesting collection of animal stories composed in India around the third century of the Christian era. It has been one of the first Indian classics to be translated into the western languages. Therefore these fables with their relevance to political, moral and religious life have become widely known and acclaimed. Patrick Olivelle the chair of the department of Asian Studies at the University of Texas in Austin, equipped with necessary expertise and familiarity with the subject matter and language, has translated these fables and rendered them in plain everyday language, though with all their complexities, for the sake of the American readers. The very informative introduction and extensive explanatory notes make the text fairly simple and easy to understand and relish. For those interested in the Indian classics, this storybook is a wonderful gift."
positive,Great buy!: You cant go wrong with these puzzles! My son loves to play with them and discover whats under the puzzle pieces. It helps a child develop number recognition which is so important. Very well made and durable! SOmething I will surely save for the next generation.
positive,"No more itching.: Use this product often for my little dogs with ?? allergies. Who knows what causes the summer itching, but,this helps lots. Eventhis winter my littlel ones have bouts that need intervention. So the bath that solves the itching for weeks.Good shiny coat, no rebound problems."
negative,"Vile, all too Vile, all too stooopid: That's N-i-e-t-z-s-c-h-e, and what he wrote bears no relation to this movie.In this stinker, all the men seem like predators, or are unappealing at best, all the women are victims. If this is reality--the reality of L.A. or anywhere, I want no part of it. In my experience, people from most classes have some kind of spark or charm. This is a film that mistakes vileness and vapid, blank suffering for profundity or realism.Watch them suffer! On second thought, don't! The most unappealing group of people I've ever fast-forwarded through in recent memory--even worse than The Hawk is Dying.I like dark films--but this is just rub yer nose in it vile and stupid.Avoid at all costs! Yech!"
positive,"wow!: How good looking and how thin, it can stay in the laptop when you finish working on the Apple.Also hard to buy if you are ordering it in the Netherlands.Amazon.com blocked the buy and didn' make clear why I couldn't order it from the Netherlands!Maybe one day I will receive an answer?"
positive,"Great album: I've always loved this album, even more so than Sgt. Pepper. I used to have this on 8 track tape when I was a kid, and listened to it constantly. I'm glad they did the American album version so we got some extra songs like ""All You Need is Love"", ""Baby You're a Rich Man"", etc. Not a bad remaster, but when you listen to it with head phones, the back and forth between the right and left phone gets a teeny bit annoying (but all the remasters have that). I can live with it. I do like being able to hear the bass better and other sounds I never picked up on before."
negative,"Highly overrated.: Not just highly overrated, but quite possibly the most overrated album of all time."
negative,"Not a good machine!!!!: I have owned several of the pod maker style coffeemakers and none can equal this unit. We have using this maker for about a month and it is the best I have ever owned!!The coffee is the same each cup and is fast.Now I want to see how long ths unit lasts! We use itseveral times a day, every day.Well a year and 3 months later and the machine is having problems. For the price charged and needs to be replaced in less than 2 years....total waste of money!!! I will not buy this high $$$ maker again."
negative,"Bad Muslim: There are many good Muslims. Unfortunately, the author, Mr. Mamdani is not one of them. He is one of those verbal terrorists who continues to blame America and Israel for his own disastrous failures and the inability of the Arab and Muslim world to get past the 15th century. The chapters on America and Israel's Genocidal activities are filled with such ridiculous points that any 9 year old could refute them.If you would like to read a pathetic comedy, this is the right book. However, it is more of a waste of good trees. Mahmood is just another leftist professor who continues to criticize and abuse the hand that feeds him, America. He is no different than the troubled child who abuses his wonderful parents, and his silly book proves it.Irwin N. Graulich"
negative,Chinese made: Item is not made in the USA as stated in the product description. It is cheaply made and is made in China.
negative,"Romp: Predictably lame entry in the werewolf genre, similar to a B movie flick a la The Howling. The scares are few and far between after you've seen Howling V."
negative,"Do we need ANOTHER ""dumb blonde""?: When I first saw the video to this song, I honestly thought it was a parody of all the blonde teenybopper girl singers. When I realized it was a real video..I just laughed. The song itself has nothing special about it to distinguish it from any other teen fluff that has come along, in fact it only shows that record companies are trying to milk the blonde girl fad for as long as they can."
positive,"Perfect for getting rid of pesky love handles: Typically I wear a medium adult women's sized shirt and a large in juniors- and I have pesky love handles thanks to my 2 beautiful babies :).This really works, well too- sucks you together and gives you that lift and confidence you want/need.The one thing that makes it not have 5 stars is that after a while it starts to bunch up in the middle (if you have some curve to you) and I'm not sure how to get it stretched out again.However, overall- if it didn't bunch up- I would give it 5 stars :)"
positive,Classic since I was young: Have always enjoyed this book and read it the first time 20 years ago and had to read it again with the new movie just out.
positive,Chocolate delicious by body hottie: this book was delicious it was very interesting i never knew most of this stuff in thereit made me so hungry for chocolate and im a chocolate fanaticDELCIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!even the book tasted good~~~ body hottie
positive,"This is an exciting read: I have yet to 'feild' test this books info yet, but I couldn't put it down. I read it front to back right away and have been designing/planing while reading. I never thought I'd get so into horticulture. This book has me really excited about growing canibus becaused it's so much more than putting some seeds in some soil and watering it. There is a real science/art to growing WELL and this book seems to cover it all from start to finish and after. There is practical help for those who wish to grow in countries where it's illegal, (sound advice from experianced people who grow and have done so for years). I haven't read any other books on this subject to compare it too but I am very pleased with this book and feel I don't need another with more info. To say there are a few gramarical errors in this book is an understatment, but I see this as a testiment to the quality of what they have grown, (or at least what the editor was smoking)."
positive,"Lust for Life: After seeing the exhibit, I was wanting to learn about his life - the book, LUST FOR LIFE is very good reading and interesting."
positive,"Kevin Bacon: As usual, Kevin Bacon does a great job playing someone who is not such a nice guy yet he manages to give his character some humanity. You can tell he researched his character's profession.Brad Renfroe does a good job too and it's so sad that his life was cut short by his life choices. He was a promising actor.The story itself was entertaining enough. I didn't get the boy's attraction to Callista Flockhart's character. She plays it pretty drab inside and out."
positive,"Beautiful little Bible -- anglicised no problem for me: I am very picky about the typography in my Bibles--and for its small size this beautiful little Bible is very easy to read. I have the Burgundy Leather Bound edition which is beautifully bound and finished. This is the aforementioned ""anglicised"" version--I do want to counter the review above by saying that I don't find the differences troublesome at all. There are very few discrepancies between this and my ""regular"" NRSV..."
positive,Binoculars for travel: Perfect size! Perfect weight! Exactly what I needed for my trip to Africa! Exactly as advertised! They did the job!!!
negative,"Worst band EVER!: nothing but chugga chugga beats, and exteremly repeative breakdowns and boring vocals , the worst of the worst when it comes to H.C. ."
positive,"Never a Dead Moment: Dead Again is a brilliant movie brought forth by Kenneth Branagh. This film is a murder mystery of the strongest content. It's not a typical murder mystery. This one takes us on a road of flashbacks and reincarnation. This film will keep you on edge as you watch the turmoil of Annie (Emma Thompson) an victim of traumatic amnesia and the private investigator(Kenneth Branagh). You'll also wonderful performances by Derek Jacobi, Andy Garcia, Campbell Scott, and Robin Williams to name a few. With Patrick Doyle's score intertwining throughout the film. This is a must see film for all not just mystery buffs. END"
positive,Enchanting: I like many of the other reviewers saw this years ago and loved it. I did have it on tape but it got erased so I am just so pleased I can now buy it to keep forever. It is just the perfect fairy tale.
positive,Best album ever made: This was the first CD I was ever given in 5th grade by my dad. I am now 25 years old and have owned 3 copies. This is Corea's best work. Very creative and forward moving. LOOOOVE IT!
positive,"It's great except for some major spots...: This is really a wonderful edition of Bible stories for children. However, the author ends up taking too many liberties with the text. The worst example is Jesus teaching the Lord's Prayer. He says, ""Our Lord in heaven."" Ack! It is ""Our FATHER"" and the difference is tremendously important. Many of the parables Jesus tells are introduced by saying something like ""Jesus told a story about the kingdom of heaven to say such and such..."" Many times the author's interpretation of the parable is debateable. These detract from the reading in my view, though a child would hardly notice. Discernment is called for by the parents! But the side notes and illustrations are very helpful and there are helpful articles on life in the various stages of Bible history times. A good Bible for bedtime reading (or any time really), but you may have to ad lib in some spots a more correct translation."
positive,Mortal Kombat is a great movie.: This action and special effects packed movie is a good one. You'll enjoy it much more than Annihilation. I really love the special effect for Scorpion's mouth that comes from his hand its really cool. You'll enjoy the movie just as much you would enjoy playing the game.
negative,"Worthless Gadget: Great idea or so I thought. I fell for the marketing hype. This little gadget is nothing more than a time stamp. You plug it in and it reads the time stamp and shows you what was playing on the radio station that you pre-selected when you registered on the web. If you were listening to a different station, you have to look it up on their site, which defeats the purpose of this thing. You can already look up songs on the net without this gadget. In fact, you can do it better without the gadget, because, emarker's coverage is limited (No AM, jazz, classical, or music videos). Save your money!"
positive,"Abbott and Costello meet the Mummy, Fraser and Indiana Jones: Good acting and terrific special effects make this film worth watching. There is a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor and lots of action.If you know anything about Egyptian history (I learned a lot in my art history classes), you may have to roll your eyes through some of the plot, but you will still find this entertaining.Startling in several scenes and just a good action film. New special effects and techniques were created for this film that never existed before... it's worth watching just for that alone. This is really a 3.5 star movie, but I rounded it up. This is highly entertaining, but way too intense for little kids. I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure if I could watch it over and over again due to the fact you really do have to put your brain and common sense on hold in a number of scenes. The DVD delivers great sound and never-before-seen footage, so this will be a great addtion to the DVD library of a sci-fi nut."
negative,"vacuum nice; everything else worthless: Why, oh why, did I think buying a plastic pencil sharpener was a good idea? Oh yes, it was because there was no metal vacuum-mount sharpener on amazon.Plastic breaks easily and quickly. The really sad thing is that after I glued the trashy plastic back together, the metal sharpener assembly broke! Do yourself a favor and buy the good old all-metal sharpener you had in your classroom when you were a kid. They do not break. This vacuum mount is handy, but that does you no good when the sharpener itself is broken."
negative,Dazzling Silver perfume By Estee Lauder: I have purchased this perfume for years at Macy's. The perfume sent to me had the packaging and it appeared to be Dazzling Silver; however either the bottle was refilled with something that would make you ill or it was 40 years old. The vendor did not respond to my complaints or agree to refund my money. I would never order from these people again.
positive,classic: What can I say. My son had to read it for school. Easy read . He lived every minute I am sure this his first of many classic reading
positive,"Clay Aiken's Measure of a Man cd: I happen to love Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken! His voice is just so pure and just a pleasure to listen to!All the songs have a meaning to them that anyone listening could find something to fit their lives!I listen to this cd daily, that is why I have to have multible copies!"
positive,"Great for beginners...: I was able to teach myself how to crochet from this book. I have completed a couple of projects from this book, and look forward to doing more. I think the instructions in the beginning are simple and easy to follow. By reading through each chapter and practicing as I went, I have even been able to design a few simple pieces of my own. If you are a more experienced crocheter, this book may not be as useful to you.The patterns are fun and modern - and waaay better than a bunch of afghans. Besides, with the resurgence of arts and crafts in fashion right now, you might be able to crochet yourself quite the summer collection!"
negative,"Overrated!: I found this book to be very dry and boring. I tried to compare this to The Giver, and I just conuldn't. I know that there are some good points to it, but not enought to sit and read it over and over again.PS-If you don't agree with me, please don't click the ""No"" button below."
positive,Impressive: I feel myself quite inadequate to write even a small review on such a masterpiece. This is a book of astonishing beauty and remarkable insight. I do believe it well worth the time and effort. The last few lines are truly the most extraordinay I have ever read.
negative,yuck: Awful. Simply awful. In every possible way. I would give it no stars if I could.I'm so glad I picked this up from the library and didn't spend my hard-earned money on it.
positive,"GREAT LITTLE BOOK, BUY ONE FOR YOUR BOSS: THIS IS THE BOOK I WISH MY PAST LEADERS HAD READ. ITS A QUICK READ THAT GIVES YOU 3 RULES FOR PEACE, HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS. T.J. ENGELBACH"
positive,very critical but this is the best book ive ever read: people are complaing about the plot but i found this book extremely entertaining and i cannot look at the world or listen to the news the same way. Read the dictionary of newspeak terms at the end and you wont be as depressed when you are done (still not a happy ending but atleast big brother falls)
positive,"NOT THE BEST BUT A GOOD FOLLOW UP!: Face it, Annie Trevelyn is a spoiled brat, progessive thinking for her day or is she trying to rebel by being shocking. She is very naive or just ignores her father's knowledge that actress usually end up being kept by some man. He didn't want that for his child.The problem is that she is not a very lovable brat at that. And Colin McBride or ""Laddie"" as Trev knew him wasn't exactly interested in that kind of wife. Colin, at thirty two, should have been a bit smarter than to trust her. And to get into trouble by befriending her actor troup, wow!But let's face it - she is the personification of many of todays kids - I guess there are some in all generations. [grin]I will admit to being supprised at who turned out to be the villian - I never guessedRecommended --M [with questions] but I did love finding out about Kate and Trev's extended family."
negative,JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: wow I had the exact same things happen to the one I got for my kid bad motion sensor and bad display. he wanted it so much we tried returning it twice after the third one didn't work even my six year old said forget it. I wish i could have given it a black hole instead of 1 star. JUNK!!!!!!!!
negative,"okay movie with a couple scary parts: You might like it and you might not.i havent seen the 1960's version and i bet it's a whole lot better than this.it depends if your a ghost story fan.if you are,see this."
positive,"Essential jazz.: A live recording of incredible clarity - a conversation between friends - patient and thoughtful. It is Getz' last. There is gorgeous air in his tenor. Kenny Barron has a light and often lively touch on piano. The ballads are especially beartiful and moving. Try listening to ""First Song"", a Charlie Haden composition, while you read Kenny Barron's liner notes. This is sad and soulful stuff."
positive,"Undoutedly the best album I've ever heard: ""Macross Plus"" is my favourite movie, and the OST fits it perfectly. After purchasing it I quickly located and purchased the OST's for ""The Vision of Escaflowne"" and the other ""Macross Plus"" albums based purely on the fact that they were by Yoko Kanno. Most of it's performed by members of the Israel Symphonic Orchestra, and it's a mixture of classical style and techno music. Ohh, it's just great. Unfortunately, I'm not much on elaboration..."
positive,"Garbage Is Anything But...: While I only give Blondie 5 stars, Garbage is my next all-time favorite band! This album really cemented that fact! Both Garbage albums are 4 stars and I recommend owning both! Verson 2.0 has a great guitar sound! And with songs Like ""Special"" and ""Push It"" Shirley Manson embodies the meaning of the phrase ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!"" Buy this cd! I won't steer you wrong!"
positive,Unique and moving style: A beautiful and tersely written story of the love affair between a teenage French girl and a Chinese man in Indochina.
positive,Great read for new managers: I bought this book for my husband and he found it very useful. He's already implementing these ideas at work with some very positive feedback. He gives this 4 out of 5 rather than 5 out 5 for it's slightly patronising prose.
positive,"Very strong debut from the man with that powerful voice: Finally, after over a decade of lackluster singers, Clay Aiken has arrived! His debut album, Measure of a Man, is unarguably one of the best albums of 2003. This album does not disappoint from the opening song to the last. Clay delivers every song to near perfection. His powerful instrument, his voice, resonates through each track. You will find it very hard not to listen to it, from beginning to end, over and over again. If i had to sum this album up in just one word, that word would have to be ""outstanding""!"
negative,"Boring beginnig, Good ending: I had to read this book for my English class and at first it was so boring! It about a young boy named Pip and he is trying to find his true indentity. At the end of the first phase he goes to London to become a ""gentleman"" because that is what his benefactor wants (Pip doesn't know his benefactor). At the end of the 2nd phase, he finds out who his benefactor is. Those two phases in the book are really boring, but I think it gets better in the end. If you read this book I suggest that you just start in the third phase because the rest is boring."
negative,"BOOOOOooooooooo: There is no fat blasting going on in the video whatsoever. This is the worst workout tape I have ever done. ""Master Blaster"" - which I thought would be a challenging strength and aerobic combo is acutally 30 minutes of upper body with weights. It was so easy I barely broke a sweat. The only lower body excercise was a couple of squats. There were fake breasts all over the tape, and when it was over I felt like I had wasted 30 min of my life. I had to do 2 more tapes after this one just to feel like I got a workout at all. very disappointing Billy! p.s. fat blaster plus was 30 min of floor aerobics. ok, some fun moves, but nothing special."
negative,"What? WHAT?: Great movie. just needed a plot, a script, some acting, some directing, etc. However, seeing those planes fly was nice."
positive,"Must-Have Book: Since my wife Gloria is as interested in this period of our history as I am, (well, almost), I thought she might enjoy having this book. Boy, did I hit the center of the bullseye! She, and I, love it. If you are old enough to remember this period of our history like we are I think you will get a lot of enjoyment and many pleasant memories form owning this collection. For those of you too young to have these experiences (I still remember the tensions my family experienced during the Cuban Missile Crisis), I think you will enjoy having this book as well.It is a valuable part of our history and should be remembered by each Amnerican.Adding this tremendous collection of photographs and text will make as outstanding a contribution to your family library as is has to ours."
negative,"Nice idea for a book, terrible writing: I am an enthusiastic amateur cook, who also loves to read. However, having grown up in US I admit I never heard of Julia Child until I married and moved here (my mother-in-law is a big fan). I thought the basis for the book to be a very clever idea, and I can see how it would be an interesting blog. Unfortunately, rather early on in the book, I found the writing to be of a rather humdrum quality. There were flashes of good writing, but they were too few and far between to sustain interest. I struggled as much as I could, but I couldn't finish it. This is the quality of writing that makes me think anyone can get a book deal - maybe even me!"
positive,Couldn't be Happier: This vacuum cleaner is the most amazing value. It picked up so much material from my office carpet that we had to empty the unit twice. We've had it for almost a month and have no complaints
positive,"Excellent Adventure game: This game is very excellent.I say this because the graphics come out very good and you in Paris on a mission.You have to visit places and talk to people.Some people will give you true information,and some will give false leading you to traps and trouble.One other good reason is that the game is probaly be the most popular game for the GBA.This is also the way most GBA games should be made instead of very short levels that will get you trapped.The two problems with this game is that some places are too colorful and if you dont go to Syria and go to spain you will find yourself stuck,so you might want to go to Syria before you go to Spain.This game is very cool so you might want to get this game!!"
positive,20 Questions: I bought this for my daughter who had mentioned her friend had one and it was a lot of fun. She was immediately fascinated with it. I am considering getting her another different one from the same place. Lets just say anything that keeps one thinking is good!
negative,?????: I never ordered this book so I can't possibly review it. I'm at a loss to understand how I'm connected to this title since I have never used the Kindle.
negative,PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: i would rather get a root canal without novicane than see this piece of cinematic garbage again! and i rated it 1 star because there is no zero or negative rating.
positive,"Great Picture Quality!!: I actually wanted to give this movie only 3 stars but i'll give the Blu Ray 4 stars. This movie looks incredible in high definition. Most people have already seen this movie a million times. I would still go out and buy this one on blu ray. It is one of the best movies i have seen in the blu ray format. I will admit it is not one of my favorite movies. It's basically just Will Smith running around beating up robots. The story could have been a lot better. However, this is a movie everyone should own on blu-ray. It looks amazing and the story still has enough action to keep you glued to your seat. I give this one 2 ROBOT SLAMMMING THUMBS UP! Buy this one on blu ray now. HOLLA"
positive,"Survival through humor and love: I could not put this book down! Although it was difficult to read at times and incredibly sad due to the abuse inflicted on kids by so-called ""Christian"" adults, its overwhelming message is of hope. If Julia can survive these horrid experiences with a sense of humor and the bond with her adopted black brother, then there is hope for all of us to move past bad things that happen and create the future we want.Great message for teenagers who hate their current lives for whatever reason.It is a wonderful tribute to the author's brother David, who truly touched my heart with his sweetness, survival skills, and desire for a loving family.Talking to Julia on the phone at our book club meeting made the experience of JESUS LAND even better... she is amazing!"
positive,"Swing! Swing! Swing!: I enjoyed the diverse ""moods"" of this CD! First and foremost was it's swing beat....then I liked the blues style. I would have to say my favorite was ""Kopasetic"" followed closely by ""Rat Face Rudy"" and ""G Man"". I enjoyed the humor that was cleverly added to the lyrics in the latter two. Some of these songs will certainly add some ""zing"" and ""pazazz"" to your day."
negative,"Better stuff out there than this junk: We just did 6 windows in our house with the Duck brand from Wal-mart and it worked great! It was our first time ever using a window insulation kit for our windows and it was fairly easy to do. The tape worked really well and we didn't have any issues. So we were at Home Depot and thought we'd buy a kit for the patio door, we saw the Frost King, figured it would be just like the Duck brand we used and so we bought it. After hours of frustration this morning, I have finally ripped it down and threw it in the garbage. What a waste of money, now I will be heading back to Wal-mart to buy a Duck brand kit for the patio door. I hate Wal-mart but it is worth it to use a product that actually works. There tape is much more durable and thicker than the thin stuff you get with Frost King. I don't know how much the kits cost at Wal-mart seeing as someone gave us the insulation kit but it can't be too expensive."
positive,A Must Have for Western Lovers: My dad loved this so much for father's day that he's forcing me to read it. He told me about how he got kinda misty when he read the stories and thought about the days when everyone wanted to be a cowboy or an astronaut. Thanks amazon.com for bringing back those memories. Happy Trails
negative,"journal making?: I bought this book wanting to learn how to make a journal. This book did not show the basics. It was a waste of money, the author seemed more interested in presenting cute ideas and making pretty pictures than teaching basics."
positive,"Zoot suit: I really enjoyed this movie, especially its music. I never was taught about the discrimination against Chicanos during WWII. This movie has a rich historical and musical background. It really deserves a new edition with commentary, interviews, and clips of LA's Chicano community during this time period. I hope some day Zoot Suit will be released in a special edition. Enjoy!"
positive,"Good despite some unbelievable bits: I found this book to be written well with great description but also thought that several situations were pretty improbable, such as a manatee swimming into the swimming tank and Amy's becoming the mermaid queen seemed a little too convenient. Amy's surprise parentage seemed a little unbelievable as well, although I had guessed that her mother had worked at the park after several clues about her affection for mermaid merchandise.Despite this, this book is a good read and I would recommend it! It's filled with summer romance, adventures, and all that can come from a teenager living in a new town for the summer without her family. It really makes you thirst for summer."
negative,Had potential but: I love the concept of being the last or almost last person on earth. This was just not my type of movie. I do agree it did go down hill on the last half. I guess I expected more but then it may be the difference on how countries make movies.
positive,"Great music with a glitch.: As always Nana Mouskouri fantastic voice imbues these classic Spanish songs with passion. Unfortunately, one track does not play correctly."
negative,Not a good look at Jane Austen.: I am truely a big Jane Austen fan and of Anne Hathaway - which was the real reason I bought the DVD - maybe if it had different Director.
negative,"A Bad Julia Childs meets a bad Anne Rice, where's Hoffman?: I love Alice Hoffman but think this is the worst book I have ever read by her. There are so many refrences to food and stupid ones that it reads like a bad Julia Childs cookbook, and the only magic in this book is omens. Omens like swans and black cats, a bad Anne Rice. Aside from this the story is weak and without a point. Where is the Hoffman I enjoy?"
negative,"I was expecting horror.....: Ray Bradbury is an exceptional writer....and this story is like a well-written Goosebumps book. It is NOT scary for an adult brought up on Stephen King horror. However, I was fooled by reviews claiming this book ""has been known to give some people nightmares"".... well, those ""some people"" are twelve year olds. I recommend this book for pre-teens. For adults, I recommend Stephen King's Needful Things, which is vaguely similar."
negative,"Awful, cheap and breaks instantly: This is the worst product I've ever seen.The ""mirror"" isn't really glass - just shiny plastic. The radio's volume is almost non-existent and the knobs break off as you take it out of the package.Awful product. Do not purchase!"
negative,"False Advertisement!!!: I bought this product not knowing what works well on VERY heavy oxidized hull on my boat. This product isn't even so so, it FLAT out sucks. I am no PRO at restoring the hull finish, but even with a 10"" buffer/waxer is still failed to bring to nice shine even using four different bonnets ranging from application to high buff. I hope this helps someone out there. It didn't help me. What a waste of time and money."
positive,Jeep clutch slave cylinder: Answer the same as the Master cylinder. Nothing available from Jeep. Seems to perform as expected. Delighted as the only other answer would have been to change complete clutch setup including bell housing.
negative,Wrong Item: The seller sent the wrong item and has never sent the item ordered. Said I needed to pay to ship the wrong item back but that he did not have the item ordered. Very disappointed.
negative,"And the point is?: The book jumps all over the place, and the point is? Magical? I suppose so. Depressing? Oh yeah. Why does Oprah pick one depressing book after another?"
positive,"Thank you!!: thanks for the super fast shipping, this dress really is super comfortable!! thanks to the other that wrote their reviews, it really helped when deciding weather or not to purchase this dress!"
negative,random shutdowns: After installing this PS my systems suffered constant random shutdowns. System would not power back up until briefly removing AC from the PS. From what I've read this appears to be an ongoing problem with the Antec NEO HE series for at least a couple years. It is evidently still not fixed.Returned and ordered the Corsair HX520 instead.
negative,"Not my dreamgirls: This movie drifts into absurdity. The scenes when it tries to slip into operatic mode are not convincing and poorly produced. From there it rapidly declines into meaningless drivel and unlike any opera I have seen, and that is many, I feel that it should make up it's mind about what it wants to be. I wish for something more than a recital of rock songs trying to blend into a plot. The plot is based on the Supreme's who were a top national act who sang some of the greatest songs of the sixties. They should sue the makers of this picture for trivializing their image. This quickly becomes the first black soap opera I have seen. Looking at the prices for this on this site pretty much confirm my thoughts. Not many movies have a price of $4.99 for new copies of them."
positive,"Great for 9mo through 18mo around the pool: I have two of these, this one and another like this but has a canopy. They are both excellent for my kids. I have used this for four of them in the pool starting around 6-9mo. That said, around 18mo, I have them graduate to wearable floating devices so they can move around freely.Overall, this is very safe since it's impossible for the kids to tip this over. Additionally, this has survived several years and four kids so I know it's durable."
positive,they r good singers.....................: i heard 1 song ........bought the cd..........made me look AT THINGS IN A DIFF WAY............AND TOLD MY FRIENDS TO BUY IT ...............THEY DID.........IF I WERE TO GIVE T.A.T.U ALL THE AWARDS IN THE WORLD.....THEY WOULD GET IT .............(THEME)SO ALL I KNOW IS THAT THEY WORKED HARD TO MAKE THE CD AND WALK AROUND THE STREETS WITH PEOPLE KNOWING THEY ARE LESBIANS.......THEY ARE STRONG AND KEEP FIGHTING 4 THERE DREAMS ..........HOPEFULLY THEY GET AT LEAST 1 AWARD TO SHOW HOW FREAKEN HARD THEY WORKED TO MAKE THE CD........................................... ......................SO LET ME SAY 1 THING NO MATTER WHO OR WHAT YOUR WITH DOESENT MEAN YOU ARE DIFFERENT............FROM THE 1 AND ONLY LESLIE ROJAS 310 5027334 11911 OCEAN PARK BLV W.L.A 90064 CA....
positive,"Timeless: No doubt Waltari deserves the critic that he has received! This book is masterfully written, taking the reader in a journey in time and space to ancient Egypt. I am not so sure of the historical accuracy, but as a historical novel, it is a really great book. Highly recommended!"
negative,"Blech.: Once upon a time, when you bought ""the video of a show"" you received, ""the video of a show.""Not any more.I do not know what this is. The closest relative it would have is an MTV music video -- and who wants to see one that is an hour and a half long.Save your money to go to a revival of Joseph.This is one to miss."
negative,"Not worth it.: This book puts me to sleep with its extremely large print and outdated stories. Writer goes on and on and wasn't at all what I expected by all the rave reviews. I'd much rather read Wesley the Owl, Marley and Me, Dewey the Library Cat, or Merle's Door. Save your money if you want to still read this and just check it out from the library."
negative,"Okay. There is a movie worse than Stargate.: Let me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies. I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Sure, they're not great films, but they've given me plenty of laughs. So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies I've ever watched, you'll know it isn't because of some bias against Mr. Sandler.This may be the worst movie ever made. It is cloying, stupid, unfunny, weird, and pathetic--in a bad way. I could go on about the awful story, the grating voices, the cliches and schmaltz, or the bad songs. (Yes, Virginia, this is a musical. The worst musical ever unleashed on film. No, I haven't seen every musical; but you don't need to in order to fully understand the depths to which this film sinks.)Don't see it. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't send any signal that they should make more cr*p like this."
negative,Boring....Ridiculously long chapters.: The book I downloaded on my Nook and Kindle doesnt seem like the same one I read in school. This version Bored me to tears.
positive,"Good Louis L'Amour Western: An enjoyable western with the classic good vs. evil plotline. Tom Selleck is at his best in western films, and he is wonderful in the role of Rafe.A couple of reviewers said that the movie doesn't have any swearing and is suitable for children--there is swearing and plenty of violence which most will find is not appropriate for younger children."
positive,lasts forever: I received farberware pots for shower gifts 42 years ago...I use them everyday and they still look great...I haven't lost a handle yet. Picked up this 3 qt because I did not have that size...love it!
positive,warrior series: I love all the warrior series and im hoping this one is going to be just as amazing!Usally i dont get imto long series but this one must be the charm!
positive,"good value: This caliper is acurate enough. I use it for biological experiments, and it does its job just well. I haven't had any problem."
negative,"Be careful what you order!!!: I ordered this for my fiance' for Christmas. He was really excited as he has been wanting this movie for a while. He opened the product and watched it and it seems to be ""counterfeited."" There are spots where it skips and also spots where it is soooo dark that you can't even see what you are watching. Not good at all. Be sure you are getting a legit copy before you order!"
negative,"Bad battery - not replaceable - throw away unit: I recently received a refurbished View as a birthday gift, charged it up, set it down a couple of days. When I picked it up I found it was dead. I charged it again, called Sansa about the issue and they agreed it was a bad battery after diagnosing the problem. They also told me the battery is not replaceable and after warranty you throw these units away. Now I need to deal with Buy.com to see if they will give me my money back or replace the unit hopefully with a e200 series. The e200 series has inexpensive replaceable batteries."
negative,Not a good product: Pampers changed their diapers and added a new material (or substance) that I can only guess is suppossed to absorb moisture. It is TERRIBLE!!! It has given my littlt guy the worst diaper rash. The first box of diapers I received was great. The fit was perfect and they were identical to the ones in the hospital. The next box was totally different with that new strip and they are just awful. Do not buy them unless they are without the strip (will be white in color and just have Sesame characters). The ones with the strip are blue with sesame characters.
positive,"Different! Non-denominational and so well done.: I love spell books and if you are the same way, this is a must have for your collection. It has it all: The days of the week best to perform a spell, the phase of the moon, magickal tools,directions to face, formations to cast etc. It is your cookbook type of publication which makes it easy to figure out. The affirmations before each spell are beautiful. They make you think and are good advice. Diane stays non-denominational and combines belief systems. I have heard you should not combine systems and then I have heard whatever works for you is best.Well, the way she takes you through these rituals is perfect for me. This book is different because it is not based on astrology, just the basic moon phases. I loved her other book ""White Light The Complete Guide to Spells and Rituals for Psychic Protection"" but for me this book is more fun and something you use time after time..."
negative,"Midwest Values: Is it my imagination or are most of the glowing reviews that seem to love this book and its approach to men and men/women relationships from the East and West coasts?Don't seem to have this problem with women---and their men---in the Heartland of America. Two kids and thirty-one years later, I'm still in love with the same hard ass, tough, determined woman I married long ago. We, however, don't play games with each other.Quit playing games and maybe one day you can say the same thing too."
positive,"It Just keeps getting better: I was just starting out leading a team building group and I found this book to be an incredible help. With some creativity, almost all of the activities can be adapted for adolescents and done in-doors. The section on leadership was good but a little simplistic. Regardless I consult this book almost every week and do not know what I'd do with out it!!! I highly reccomend it!"
positive,"feels squishy with the slightest bit of wetness: I don't remember the Baby Dry being like this before, but they feel like that dry max stuff. It feels like she's soaking wet and squishy after the tiniest bit of urine hits the diaper. I much prefer the other high cost brand that doesn't cost as much!"
negative,"YUK@!: We couldn't force ourselves to drink this. It literally gagged us every time we tried, no matter how we tried it."
positive,"Lord of the Flies asks us to question human nature...: In William Goldings timeless tale, Lord of the Flies, we are shown a much darker side of human nature. English Chior boys, shipwrecked and alone on a deserted island, with no pre elected leaders, no sociey. Just what will they do to survive? What will some do to gain control? You will be shocked by you findings. If you have seen films on this one, ingnore them. No film can touch William Goldings pen on this one. You must read to understand, that without our everyday hum drum society. Without stucture we only have our worst intent, our darkest side lies within... Read Lord of the Flies to understand..."
positive,"Timeless!: We are planning to see a performance of this play in a few weeks and since we had read it many years ago, we needed to reacquaint ourselves with the content. Amazon delivered it to my mailbox in two days. Ibsen's play is a profound and intricate study of characters, relationships, the environment and the economy."
positive,"Love it: This works really well. I used it to help get my abdominal wall back together at 9 months post-partum. It's still a bit separated but this definitely helped. I wish I knew about it sooner. It also helps support the back when picking up my child over and over and over again and a good reminder to keep my weak abs pulled in when doing it. Great to wear during exercise, again as a reminder to keep the abs in and strengthen them correctly inward. Also, it looks hot! And sometimes I wear it out. I wear it with a tank top underneath as suggested in other reviews all the time. Suggest getting seamless tanktops otherwise irritation may occur. 27"" waist before pregnancy, 30"" waist when I bought a size medium, 28"" now, and could probably get the next size down if I really wanted..."
positive,Invest: I bought this book when my daughter was 3 months old and wish I had gotten it earlier. It is very helpful and has lots of information from pregnancy and beyond. I recommmend anyone who plans on breastfeeding to buy this book.
positive,"Nice fit, color, quality: I would definitely recommend these pants. They fit well and the color is great. We buy Dickies pant a lot for their durability."
positive,"Love the product, quick shipment: I am reordering this product, I used to get it in the salon but not anymore. It ships quickly and I haven't had any issues with it. The only thing is I wish the packaging was a little more secure from spilling."
negative,"Terrible Quality: I was so excited to get this dvd and share it with my son, as it was one of my favorites growing up. I was terribly disappointed in it when it came. The color quality is awful, the darker scenes, like Gollum's cave, are so faded out you can barely see it. The soundtrack is missing in places, the special effects (Smaug's fire, Sting's vortex sound, etc) are completely missing. They repeat themselves in places. Utterly let down."
positive,"One of the best books I've ever read: I followed Edmond Dantes for 24 years. from a happy young man through many years of suffering till his revenge, which eventually didn't make him happy as he thought it would. What would have his life been like if he didn't have the misfortune to be imprisoned for 14 years. I think he would have made a fortune by himself and be happy at the same time, maybe less educated and brilliant but definitely happy. I couldn't help love and admire him and was sorry to let him go at the last page of the book.Dumas' writing is brilliant and breathtaking. He lets the reader guess and understand sometimes things that are not even written. I wonder how much of Dantes is Dumas.The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most wonderful and exciting books ever written."
positive,"Hagakure: An excellent foray into the mind of the Samurai. Details of the Samurai experience and the Samurai Code. Many hidden treasures in this book, you just have to look for them."
negative,Never received order: Ordered this item on May 5th and never received it. When I emailed the sender they apologized which was nice but I never got my book.
positive,"Prince Hal grows into his own as his father passes away: One of the more influential Shakespearean histories. Because of the inspiration it provides for any latter work involving a young male with 'daddy issues' (like ""The Lion King"") this play has had enduring power.The Prince of Wales, Hal, son of King Henry the IV is being thrust into power as his father dies. Conspiracies and the Crusades, a hysterical hostess and Falstaff, and the elevation of profanity to a high and refined art all add character to this play. I would argue that it is almost as much comedy as history.The most moving aspect of the play is Prince Hal understanding the reality that his father's death is thrusting upon him. From trying on the crown as his father lies unconscious but not dead to disavowing the rogues he had been a delinquent with, his growth is unmistakable.A very moving play and one of the more rewarding histories.E.M. Van Court"
positive,"Excellent support: This is the best sports bra that I own. If you are like me, with large boobies, then this is a great buy! It was hard for me to find a sports bra for larger size breasts that didn't smash you and cut off your circulation. I use this bra for all of my physical activites and I don't feel ashamed or embarassed while out excersizing. I do not have to wear a 2nd bra and I don't have my DD's bouncing back and trying to knock me out (cuz they are real)."
negative,"Ulysses is Useless: There is one great line in this book:""History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.""Unfortunately, the rest of it is unintelligible, tedious bunk. Save your time and energy for something like '1984' by George Orwell, a REAL twentieth century classic."
negative,"The title gives it away: A dictator ?? You gotta be kidding. Ataturk is the reason Turkish people have democracy, women's equality, and a secular government. Without this 'dictator' they would be still in the stone ages. The 'author' has NO understanding of the Turkish and Ottoman history."
negative,"Works great at first............: I was a little skeptical at first about using this device... do to it's incredibly small size. However I quickly fell in love with how easy it was to install on my windows xp machine and the excellent Netgear Smart Wizard that sits in my system tray, making it possible for anyone to quickly get connected to their network. Unfortunately my original skepticism quickly came back to confront me. After using the device for only a few days my connection dropped. I had to unplug the thing and reboot my computer before I was able to get back on my network. I've only had it for about 2 weeks and I've had to unplug it and restart my computer probably 15 times to get it to work again. I never used to have problems in the past with my other wireless usb adapters so I have a good feeling that it's due to this devise. I do notice that it gets very hot if you leave it in your computer for a long time, I'm no engineer but this might be somehow related to its poor performance."
negative,"Not bad, but better books exist.: He has some interesting points to make, but the book is very thin, and Mr. Best is a dull writer. For much better books on the same or similar topics, read recent books by Michael Shermer, Barry Glassner, or Wendy Kaminer."
positive,"Delightful: Mmmm...Biography & Memoirs? or Cooking, Food & Wine? A little of both. But it really doesn't matter what this book is about because Julie Powell can write. The account of her self-appointed task to prepare all the recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking never bogs (blogs?) down; she weaves into her book stories of Julia's introduction to cooking and her own bouts with infertility and her friends' relationship ups and downs as well as, of course, her experiments with French cooking. Delightful."
negative,"Fantasy For Dummies: I found Eragon to be a very basic, bare-bones fantasy story. The way I see it, the basic structure of a fantasy plot is like a skeleton and it is the author's job to give those bones flesh. However, Paolini failed to do this and his book is the perfect example of a stereotypical fantasy. It seems as if Paolini was writing Eragon the way he thought it SHOULD be written rather than letting himself write his own story. This book might be useful as a first-timer's introduction to fantasy but as an actual work of literature, it's just not good."
negative,"The ABYSS - A real LOSER!: You know and I know this movie is so boring it will leave you with nothing! One of the worst! Truthfully, this motion picture is an absolute waste of time.... Dosen't deserve a one star, except for special effects. Almost ruined Mary's career."
positive,"Fair and Tender Ladies: Lee Smith takes us on a historical fictional tour of rural south in the late 19th to mid 20th century through the life if Ivy Rowe. Ivy's life experiences are chronicled in letters to living and dead family and friends.Intelligent and independent Ivy's early life is a large family on a mountain top. The family leaves the mountain for a small town after her Father passes and farming on the mountain is no longer sustainable.Town life introduces the reader to a rich parade of characters that directly touch Ivy and her siblings. Ivy's complex nature and curiosity drives her to experience life on the edge, no matter the consequences.Lee Smith beautifully chronicles the life of a Steel Magnolia through Ivy Rowe and we are the better for it."
positive,"The Causes of the Civil War: This book is a seminal work for any student of the Civil War. It gives the opinions of those that actually lived through it, opinions from before, during, and after the war. These opinions are conflicting of course. For me it was not the type of book you can just sit down and read but rather a book to browse from time to time. An absolutely fascinating book."
positive,"My cousin Rachel: It is my favorite author, thank you for that wonderful book. I love the stories Daphne Du Maurier had written. It's very emotional and inspirational reading. I love to read it and re-read it more times."
positive,"Nelly, Nelly Nelly: What can I say? I love this cd because it has all my favorite songs from sweat & suit on one cd. I don't have to take one cd out to hear songs from the other cd. Plus i love the fact it has my favorite song on there with Murphy Lee (he needs to drop a new cd) River Don't Runnn. I love the new single Grillz. Way to go Nelly."
negative,"Could have been better: How can a woman that has drowned and been revived get up and walk around a short time later? No wonder the ausience sniggered at the cinema where I saw this movie. It has some big and impressive scenes and great music.What a pity the story wasn't properly thought out a bit more.The end is an anti-climax and makes no sense.OK.the aliens have gone to the surface and ships lay on their side.What now?If it goes back down then those ships will sink! James Cameron,leave the writing to the writers please."
negative,Transformers: I have not received it yet am very disappointed as I was told I would get it by the official release date am still waiting
negative,"Once upon a time: When Soft Image was a novelty and 3D construction a really defying task for computers and designers, this work could be considered a reference. It has gone old though. Once the techniques used in the animation are not so complex anymore, some of then are features of today 3d softwares, some so simple that even my young daughter masters, the animation gets very boring and naive looking at some point. Music is not so good to be worth the whole work. Even so, the authors deserve their merit."
negative,"Great idea, poorly engineered: Where were the engineers for this toy, is what I'd like to know. What a great idea it is, but it just doesn't hold up to play. Now, I suppose if you're willing to bolt it into your basement wall, then it would hold up to some strong playtime. However, it is almost completely incapable of withstanding any play whatsoever without collapsing onto the floor. I highly recommend you read all the other reviews on this toy prior to purchase. Definitely needs to go back to the drawing board - ours went back to the store! What a disappointment!"
negative,"Boring!: We had to read it for our GCSE coursework. Everybody found it boring and too descriptive. If you have a choice, do not choose this book! To make it worse, it is incredibly long and depressing. DO NOT EVEN TOUCH IT!!!"
negative,"Not a waste of money...But not the only book you will need.: This was the second book I purchased in my quest to master Perl. The first being Perl and CGI For The World Wide Web, by Elizabeth Castro. I recommend that if you are a beginner start with something other than Teach Yourself - CGI Programming in a Week. Though not a total waste of money ( I have found it to be useful as a desktop reference. ) It will not be the last book you will ever need to purchase on your way to mastering Perl and the CGI protocol. On the bright side it does spend a fair amount of time discussing Server Side Includes, which come in handy when developing dynamic web applications. Finally, be prepared to purchase Programming Perl- by Larry Wall to truly master the language. GOOD LUCK"
positive,"The best eye gel I've ever used!!: I have been using this eye gel for a few years now and while I am approaching 50, my eyes sure don't look it!"
positive,"Need odd taste to enjoy this: So, this comes across as a mockumentary, but it is suppose to be 100% true. It certainly doesn't have widespread interest, but I really enjoyed it, in its own silly way."
negative,"Don't bother!: This cd is so not worth the buy! I heard it had club mixes and i was over the moon. But i'm so often disappointed with them. This is no different. They run for about 6 minutes each. They are some of the worst i've ever heard. They don't enhance the song at all and they certainly don't make me want to get up and dance. I could have made better mixes than this!! I've heard better remixes of the original by Berlin!Sorry, no offence to Jessica of course. But if i was her i'd be approving song before they are release OR fighting with the company to not release them or make better ones!!Still having said all this, i know people have different tastes, so it's best if you can hear a sample of them first. You can hear the first 30 sec. if you go to sonymusic.com.au but they don't show you the whole tragedy ahead!"
positive,"Easy to Install Works Great: We dropped our phone line now that we can have DSL without it. Bought this item, hooked it up in about 5 seconds, and now we are saving $30 a month with no phone line. This device found every network in our area, even our neighbors which our router rarely can find. It's small and can rest on top of the tivo or on top of the entertainment center if there is no room above the Tivo."
negative,"Self-plagiarism by Parker: You have to kind of respect the size of the cojones on Robert Parker to put out this book. Not only is the main character Spenser with breasts, but she has her own tough-guy sidekick like Spenser, her own cute dog like Spenser, and the relationship with her boyfriend ends up exactly like Spencer's and Susan's. What makes Parker the winner of the chutzpah award is the fact that the PLOT of the book is the same as the Spenser novel ""Early Autumn""! I give this 2 stars because if you've never read any Spenser books it's a pretty decent read, but if you're a fan of the series, this is just Spenser rehashed."
negative,"What the heck is up with this cover?: 'Herland' is hardly a cracking read, but it's interesting as a feminist-historical text. It's worth reading, but for the love of Mike get a different edition. This cover is utterly hideous and completely at odds with the ethos of the story. Why would a female-only society, where dress is utilitarian and reproduction asexual, tart themselves up in pink eyeshadow and mascara that would make even an overly-flamboyant drag queen quail?"
positive,Lion of Ireland great story: This is a history of Ireland told in an adventurous manner. History can be so boring not this time. Thank you.
negative,"Poor Quality: I just received the DVD today, and watching it was very disappointing. It's only 1.9GB on disc. There are double images throughout most of the movie. It's a 4:3 frame size rather than at its 1.85:1 original size. Don't buy this Synergy DVD!"
negative,"Triple Cheese: This is possibly the worst movie of the year. Let's just forget for a moment the outlandish stunts that are for the most part, absolutely impossible and not even close to believable. Let's focus on the writing. This is just a poorly written movie. It's cheesy and disgustingly predictable. It's a great movie for people who don't like movies with content."
negative,"Like getting jabbed by a stick with poo on it.: It might make you cry a little, but mostly you're angry that such a thing has been inflicted on you.And it stinks.Really, really bad."
positive,"Product good, service grand: I purchased this DVD for use in my classroom. It is a copy of a very old animation and I was prepared for the less than today's excellence in the areas of sound reproduction and special effects. What really made this purchase a wonderful experience was the seller. I had questions and the seller wrote back quickly and even went out of her way to test the product for me. Personal service like that is rare. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase."
negative,Pathetic And Passe: This is a Sad attempt at turning a dollar I purchased this book in the attempt to learn something about the Gothic Culture but as it turns out it is nothing but Self Righteous people creating an alternate life to escape thier mundane lives.
positive,"Morgana Forever More: I love Morgana King & how priviledged we are to have someone who has such a wonderful interpretation of the standards as she displays on this CD. Her silky smooth voice gets me everytime along with her vocal range. In saying that though, each song you listen to is a treasure and you can feel she is singing just for and too you the listener."
negative,"The Finale of the Original Gamera Series... Thank God: I found this last entry of the original Gamera series to be such a disappointment. One could easily see that is was rushed and only produced to compete against Toho's Godzilla series. I found the premise to be unoriginal and the spfx were horrible. I think more money went into Gamera's fire breath than the costumes or actors. I'd rather cut my finger on the Subway sandwich wraps than watch this movie again. ~.~ It made me laugh more than cover my eyes from the scary turtle and the rubber shark... BUT I will admit to liking Zigra's design. A 90's version of him would be nice. I mean, they did update Gyaos... twice! Heh. Well ja ne."
positive,"Works as Advertised....so far.: I wasn't sure about ordering this since the one review was pretty negative; but, I decided to try it anyway. It shipped super fast and I installed it right away. My 4 year old daughter likes to have all of her ""important"" things at arms reach in the car, so I needed something to organize the clutter. I ordered 2, but think I will only need one now that it's in. I'll give the other one to my husband for his car. The pockets are pretty big--we put a good sized fleece blanket in the largest part. There is room for a couple of drink bottles, wipes, movies and a couple of small toys. And, I love the umbrella holder. Her little Dora umbrella fits perfectly.Overall, a great product. Now, lets see how durable it will be. I will write another review if I find that it doesn't wear and tear well."
positive,"it works!: I ordered this with some trepidation, having used electric razors before and found them pretty useless...ineffectual.I used disposable razors for years but ultimately got tired of carving myself up & stopped shaving altogether. Then I read a review of the newer electrics elsewhere, which referred to this model as the ""BMW of shavers"". They also noted many people were equally satified with the lower end model-so I came to Amazon looking for that one, and found this, reconditioned for about the same price.I have to admit that I bought it fully expecting not to be satified but got a pleasant suprise. It is almost as close as a razor! All that said, if you've been unsatified with other electrics, this one is worth a try."
negative,Children's illustrated bible: The Bible is great but I had to return due to the size. It is not clear how very small it is. I had to return and then look elsewhere to buy the larger version
negative,"Immediately broke: Broke the very first time I pulled the handle. Very dissappointed, was going to give as a Christmas present. Made very cheaply, only good point was that it arrived on time."
positive,"Find in it what you like...: I had not been familiar with the myth of Psyche nor with the writing of C.S. Lewis prior to picking this book up, so I walked into this story with no preconceived notions at all. I really enjoyed the plot and characters, especially for the first half or so. Then, the book became quite bizarre and abstract, and I personally became less engaged. It wasn't until the last 20 pages or so that I once again was pulled back in. Lewis helps the reader gain perspective and insight into what we have read, and this is what helped make the story worthwhile. I am not sure I would read other Lewis novels -- not being a fan of fantasy or a particularly religious person -- but I am glad that I read this one."
negative,disapointed: The information in this book did not help me at all. The condition of the book was good but wasn't what I needed.
positive,"A must read for seniors.: This is a very good story especially for seniors. It will give them a different outlook on life, show them that their life isn't over and there is still a lot of living to do. I couldn't put it down until I finished, and I'll read it again."
negative,Long Awaited--Kind of Disappointed: After eagerly awaiting the 5th book for over 10 years I find myself disappointed in it. It was very slow going at the beginning and introduced too many new characters who didn't seem to have a whole lot to do with anything. Brukeval and Laramar could have been made into better antagonists but were left kind of hanging. Don't get me wrong...I loved her first three books and the fourth was alright but I guess I expected more out of the fifth book because it took so long to be finished. Hopefully the 6th book won't take as long and will be better than the 5th.
negative,"not a big fan of pearl jams new material: i know im probably the only 1 star review so im gonna get bashed but i simply do not like this album. i wasnt a fan of no code or yield either and if you dont like those albums you wont like binarual. i was a big fan of ten and v.s but i just dont like the new pearl jam sound. no i am not a kornfan or kidrock posuer im more on the hardrock/metal side (metallica, nirvana) but i have one ? for pearl jam fans- what would be so bad about another album like ten? it has great guitar solos as shown in alive and emotional songs like black. to me binarual is just simply boring. breakerfall and insignifigance are pretty good but to me the rest of the songs fail to delvier. nothing as it seems makes me fall asleep and soon forgot, well eddie vedder plays a ukule. but if your not a fan of the new pearl jam do not buy this album. youll wish you never did"
positive,"""One of the best books on Christanity I have ever read!"": Lewis's descriptions and illustrations of the basics of the Christian life are very practical for the one investigating the tenents of Christianity. I have read and re-read ""Mere Chistianity"" several times and each time gaining new insight. Next to the Holy Bible it holds a place of regular usage."
positive,"THE GOOD OL DAYS OF STEVEN SEAGAL: AFTER SPENDING 7 YEARS IN A COMA, A COP [STEVEN SEAGAL] GOES AFTER SOME CORRUPT PEOPLE THAT KILLED HIS WIFE. THIS MOVIE SHOWS THE OLD STEVEN SEAGAL THAT ACTION FANS REMEMBER AND LOVE. THIS MOVIE HAS GOOD ACTION AND A LOT OF EXCITEMENT, WHICH IS MISSING FROM A LOT OF SEAGAL'S RECENT MOVIES. FOR FANS OF SEAGAL, THIS SHOULD BE A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE."
negative,"Horrible Kindle Conversion: Look for another version if you plan to read this on your Kindle. The publisher made no effort to have this formatted correctly for the Kindle. Because this is a classic, it deserves to be done in a more respectful manner than what was done.. I can only imagine the author is rolling over in his grave!"
negative,"Lasted three months: This is my second Keurig, with the first being a the single serve model. Based on my positive experience with the single serve model, I decided to buy the high-end B-70.My Keurig B-70 only worked for three months before it would either not brew, or overflow. I had performed the maintenance ahead of schedule to prevent future problems, but that didn't help.It took a few calls to customer service to convince them that the unit was bad, but once they believed me, they replaced it quickly. The new one (less than two months old) has worked well, and I did notice a few changes between the old unit and the new unit. I'm hoping those changes fixed the problems.Funny thing is that there were no return instructions for the old unit. Seems like they don't want the defective one back.I'm disappointed that the high priced version didn't last, and I'm also glad that I kept my single serve model that has worked for years."
negative,For those wanting intellectual discussion: This is a book of the mind. An intellectual foray into philosophy. I know it is a well regarded text but it certainly was not where I wanted to explore in finding a more heartful understanding of faith. I admit I didn't get terribly far into it before I gave up and moved on. There is so much more out there that calls to a heart centered seeker.
negative,"Didn't Work: When I received this in the mail it didn't work. Upon further inspection, it looks like FansEdge sent me an already defective product because the product had batteries in it already, which it was not supposed to come with. I called them and they were supposed to send me a return label to send the product back and a refund. I am still waiting 3 weeks later for both of these and now have to work with my credit card company to contest payment. I would not order anything from FansEdge again."
positive,"Future and Past of the Human Civilization: a Epic Story: Before ""Foundation"" i'd read somes short-storys from Asimov, so i become insterested in his style. And what can i say now about this book? Really is a excelent piece of scifiction: Asimov united 4 independent stories in a book with lifely descriptions, a strong main-story and credibles characters in incredibles situations,...the result is just epic. So, with this book we become in eyewitness on the monumental development and fall of the human civilization... becoming it in a surrounding journey trought our future and past."
negative,"Don't waste your money: Used it once and put it in the dogs' tub. It's really awkward to use. It sucks up your water pressure, too. Can't figure it out. I have incredible water pressure, but with this thing on, it went down to nothing. Stick to the original shower massage by Waterpik."
negative,"Doesn't work: We do not have a heavy ironing board, but apparently it is too heavy for this. I've tried to hang the ironing board inside the closet and the apparatus keeps the door from completely closing. When we hang it outside the door, same frustrating situation. I have a cat that loves to sleep inside the closet and she leaves her beautiful white hair over every shoe and piece of clothing in the closet. So I now have one useless metal contraption hanging over my door and an abundance of cat hair in the closet. I definitely do not suggest you buy this over-the-door ironing board hanger unless you have an extremely light ironing board (maybe a mini board will work?) and no cat/dog in the house. There has got to be a better designed product to help store the board."
negative,Where is John Grisham?: Will the real John Grisham stand up please! This makes 3 in a row...surely he is on vacation and this is written by someone else. Where is the wonderful detailed stories of the past.
positive,"Great for any Stargate Fan!: Too bad good shows do not last forever, but this DVD continues the Stargate tradition. It is good fun!"
negative,"Gloria... que pasa?: I don't know what Gloria was thinking when she made this CD... but don't expect a ""Mi Tierra"" part 2! This CD lacks all the great salsa rhythm Gloria provided with both Mi Tierra and Abriendo Puertas. In fact, you get so sick of hearing all the ballads on this CD, that you want to return it the very next day! Dont get me wrong... i love Gloria, but Alma Caribena is terrible."
negative,"NEVER use the movie mode on this camera!: I have probably spent 50-60 hours trying to convert my digital movies recorded on this camera to dvd. I am not technically-savvy, so I expected to spend some time, but this is ridiculous. I finally got the imagemixer software (included on the Olympus Master disc)to burn a dvd, but the sound is just a high pitched squeak at the beginning of each clip. So irritating. I tried converting the quick time movies into mpeg-4 using cucusoft and burning a disc with nero express 6, but the quality was so poor, I didn't even bother to burn the dvd.As a still camera, this is fine. It's my first digital, and I have been happy with my photos. I like the larger than usual LCD. I also like the ability to close the LCD and drop the camera in my purse."
negative,shadow magic: Very nice history. Bought it to learn Chinese. So much background noise I couldn't. Hear well. But nice movie. No surprises if watching with children. My grandsons (5&8). Enjoyed.
positive,Love this Pillow: I went to a Hilton and slept on the most comfortable pillow and then bought it. I love the softness of the down with the firmness of the foam that also keeps the quills from poking me in the head.
negative,"Doesn't even hold a two-year-old's interest: I thought my 2-year-old daughter would love this toy when she got it for her birthday, since she loves anything that she can play with in the water. However, there really isn't much you can do with this; there are no moving parts, and only one way for the pieces to fit together. Another point against it is that you can't see the diver's face very well. This made her lose interest quickly. On top of everything, it leaks! My little girl still insists on having it in the bathtub with her (she has to have ALL her bath toys with her every time), so it slowly sinks to the bottom of the tub during every bath, and after every bath I empty the water out of the submarine. I haven't thrown it away because it was a gift, but I'm losing patience with this toy."
negative,"Good Phone, Lousy Customer Support: I actually like the phone quite a bit. It works pretty well in almost every regard. Sound quality is very good, buttons are easy to find and use, and the feature set is pretty good. Overall, a nice phone and a good value.However, this item is advertised as having 20 number memory, which is 10 ""one touch"" and 10 ""two touch"". I have not been able to get the two touch feature to work.I tried calling the customer support number. I could never get an answer. I was always put on a queue, waited for a couple of minutes, and then offered a voicemail option or dropping the call. I left messages, and never got a call back. I (twice) tried recalling immediately after getting booted. I tried for an hour. No joy. Don't buy Northwestern Bell Phones unless you are sure nothing will ever go wrong."
negative,"wrong product: I ordered this for an October birthday. imagine my surprise when we opened the product for viewing and found not ""The Mummy Returns,"" but ""The Mummy"" (which I had also purchased)."
negative,"frustrating for the DSLR photographer: I'm sure this was a great book, 8 years ago (i'd give it 4 stars then), but it's taken me forever to get through the book when every other technique is a film-specific technique like ""duplicating slides"", ""pushing film, or ""cross-processing"", or is referring to specific cameras, film types, etc to get desired results. most of this can be done in photoshop with one dslr and a couple lenses.thankfully, i just saw that Frost has released a new version of this book specific to digital photography. i probably wouldn't buy it though. i hope i can sell this used."
positive,"Oh weeds: Love weeds, love blu ray...what could be better!? The show seems to be getting a little out of control but season 5 brought it back I thought..."
negative,"BIT OF FLUFF: A bad parody of ""My Fair Lady."" Only redeeming feature are the extras provided by Nancy Walker, whose voice always belts out a song with clarity and sincerity."
positive,"Blondie's toughest live album yet: This Cd is my favorite Blondie live cd. It has a very raw, tough rock sound which reminds us of Blondie's punk roots. It sounds more rock and roll than the 1999 live cd. comparing to the latter, the following songs sound much better here : Hanging on the telephone, Rapture,X Offender, Dreaming,etc. However I have two things to complain about, what happened to atomic and maria?? If people actually requested the songs played in this concert, i am surprised that maria and atomic were not requested!and the Heart of glass version on this cd is very week comparing to the 1999 live cd.Other than that, this cd proves why Blondie is making it to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
negative,"More fiction than fact: Another example of how Hollywood can take a great story and make it painfully drull. The dialogue is laughable (completely comtemporary), the attribution and manifestation of Joan's madness utter nonsense, and it was probably Hoffman's worst perfomance in a movie in well over 20 years. Braveheart it is Not."
positive,"Golding the allegorical master: When I read this book two years ago in 9th grade, I was like Ohhh great. But, with further reading and understanding of the book, I really came to love it. I wouldn't hesitate in calling it my all time favorite novel. On the surface, Golding seems to be merely telling a tale of a group of boys stranded on an island. However, a closer look reveals Golding's true intentions of depicting the world and war as depraved and corrupt. He has an extremely pessimistic view of human society and this can be seen through some of the actions of the boys. I would also like to say that Ralph is a great character and the movie is one that should not be missed!"
negative,Don't waist your money: So full of mistakes. Where ever she got the patterns she did not translate them well. Totally ripped off Dot Matthews. Bought rights to her pattern and didn't even write it correctly.
positive,"Most underrated hip-hop album of it's time.: By far the most underrated album of it's time. At at time when artists released albums with one or two songs, this album packed a full length album of great songs. No song disappoints on this album.I wish MC Deff could have continued, he was what made Criminal Nation special.Trust me, buy this album. I positively guarantee you won't be disappointed by this album."
negative,"Actually, this book is not worth one star.: This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book."
negative,"ridiculous: Of course there is no reviews. Who is going to buy a $54 album when they don't even give you the samples. Bah, humbug."
negative,"Biggest disappointment of 2002!: I waited 12 years for this?!?Most of the other reviews have said enough. Basically, this is disappointing. I barely was able to slog through it once, and have tried and tried to read it again (unlike the other books, which have been re-read countless times - especially Mammoth Hunters).The book is written as though the author didn't remember details from the other books. Misspelled names...things that just don't jive with what had been established in the other books...and NO PLOT. And don't get me started about the baby's name, or how anticlimatic the Summer Meeting was. Ugh.I can only hope that Book Six is better...however, I will be checking it out of the library rather than shelling out the money...Sad, sad, sad..."
positive,"JANE AUSTEN FOR GROWN-UPS!: I'm thrilled that this book remains a perennial favorite, despite the theme. These days, so few people are patient enough to wait, to delay gratification, to survive disappointment, to learn to trust again.By the way, the only movie version worth watching is the one with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root. Great casting throughout."
negative,"Broke after 45 days of light use: I bought mine at the local Best Buy. Wish I had bought from Amazon instead-read on to find out why.It played great at first. Then I started to hear an occasional squelching sound, like a giant water ballon bursting. At first it was once every few days, then every song, then constantly. Then it quit reading disks period, both storebought CDs and MP3s. All were scrupulously clean and played fine on my old cd player.Because it was over 30 days, Best Buy would not refund my money. Swapped unit number two is hooked up to the stereo now.I hope this one keeps working.--Vance In Denver"
negative,"No suction: Not good suction...It won't stay on the window...The temperature changes cause it to pop off, so it really is useless."
negative,"Major Disappointment: As a lover of all things Austen, I was very excited when I first came upon this book. But this completion of Sanditon is incredibly weak. The plot wanders aimlessly, although ""wanders"" is perhaps too favorable of a term since it implies some momentum.Worse, the characterization is frightfully dull. The previous Sanditon completion in the 1970s by ""Another Lady"" is vastly superior, fleshing out very memorable characters and making you really care about Charlotte. By the end of this book, I didn't care about any of the characters as they were so frightfully dull. The climactic conclusion was more like an afterthought; perhaps the writer(s) wanted to be done with the book as fast as I did.Avoid this debacle and track down the completion by ""Another Lady"" instead."
positive,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL: This was a most remarkable book!I absolutely loved it.I will never get rid of this book.It's completely great.It was wonderfully written!I cried in the sad parts.How could anyone hurt such a wonderful animal!I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative,"How can I say?: Stephen KIng is a master writer. Reading his books, however, may be an exausting experience, since he frequently writes a lot, I mean a lot, of unecessary pages. BUt, most of the times, he does it showing that he's really a gifted writer.But in DREAMCATCHER things somehow go wrong. It's a hard book to read, even if the chemistry among the four old friends from Derry, more Duddits, was something very enjoyable to follow. But he kept developing unecessary histories to the plot. Case in point: the Russian woman who throwed herself into the water depository. Useless, simply useless stuff to the main plot.This is one King book trhat I kept struggling to reach the end."
positive,"Lightweight and Warm: The comforter is not lofty, but does ""fluff up"" nicely. It's lightweight, but don't let that fool you ... it will keep you warm. I gave it 4 stars only because the loft is low, but it really doesn't affect the warmth of the product. Great for a guest room. Buy it!"
negative,"cute idea, but not worth it, save your money: Cute idea, but toy is cheaply made and doesn't work most of the time. Not worth it, save your money."
negative,"Not Usable In Its Current Form: The DSM-320 is not ready for consumer use and I'd wait for D-Link to update the server software before I would even consider purchasing one. The current version lacks even the most basic media player functionality and really doesn't do justice to what appears to be an exception device from a hardware standpoint. Current problems with the D-Link DSM-320 include:1. Unable to play more than one song in a row. The player stops after each song on an album. Must build custom playlists for each album in your collection.2. Repeated ""Unsupported file format"" on standard MP3 files. These same files play on every other mp3 player I own.3. Unresponsive remote - have to hit each button 2-3 times before the entry will register.4. No Divx support."
negative,"Not a fan of this: Woo, yamaha really did get carried away this time... I thought they could stick with something practical, but er.. this isn't it. I tried it in a store, and you can't even really mix with it, much less actually use it in a club or at a rave. If you wanna be a DJ and scratch, use turntables. If you are bent on scratching with a cd player then get the cd scratch mixer from American DJ, because it's a good bit better than this abomination."
positive,"Rushing into things: For those of you who are looking for an ""educational expirience"" and feel that you were jilted with this toy have forgotten one of the mose basic premises of childhood......a childs job is to play.This toy was a bit over priced for what was recieved yes, but leaving a child with their imagination is a far better gift than any leap pad or other electronic device. The learning comes from being able to make connections, build stories, follow through on thoughts, learning how to play with others, expanding vocabulary so forth and so on. Sometimes the most basic toys really are the best.This was a well recieved toy from children in my life and the hours it was utilized far outweigh the price paid."
negative,micro powder salt: The micro salt was not really powder. The salt was micro in size but did not have the ability to cling or stay on a food substance when applied. After thinking about it I don't think it can be changed into real powder form. Other then being really high in cost will stop me from purchasing it again. However I was glad to see this product exist in this form anyway. Thank you.
negative,Buyers Be Warned: I bought this as a replacement radiator to an old set of speakers. What I was unaware of was that this item has a downward facing lip which adds to the size. To get this to fit I will have to carve about 1mm around the opening. Even then the radiator will be resting on this lip instead of flat against the case.On a side note; shipping cost half of the price of the item and came very slowly. Overall very disappointed with this product.
positive,"I N S P I R I N G ! !: I read this because I've seen all the media versions of it since I was born. I wanted to see what the ""original"" said.I wasn't disappointed. This is BETTER than all the movies (as good as they are). This book demonstrates the kindness, empathy and forgiveness that Christ taught us.Certainly Christmas-worthy if you ask me.--George Stancliffe"
positive,"Donna Richardson-4 Day Rotation Workout: Love it! I am a busy wife and mother of 2. I can fit the 15 minute routine into my schedule. If time allows, I can do more than one segment. I have given several copies as gifts."
negative,"Ha Ha Ha: Why is she not famous? I agree with the other smart reviewer, because she STINKS! Wow does she stink! I had no choice but to throw her CD in the trash. I wasn't going to torture anyone by giving them this CD as a present! No way! I just THREW IT AWAY!"
positive,"Excellent, Exhilirating, and Fun: And great and entertaining film! A WONDERFUL GUEST CAST and some flavor to it, and is not racially discriminant(Vanessa Williams is in it), something we a lot these days.Armand Assante and his band of supporting actors give great life to the film and I notice the supporting actors are actually trying to make it better, rather than most actors who just do the role because it'll make them money. GREAT MOVIE, WORTH THE $13.00Now, you wonder, why did he give it four stars out of five if it is so good? The reason is this movie is very depressing at some parts and gets very gruff and there is and little crude comedy. Especially at the end. That plucks off a star, just because it was pretty bright and cheeful during the voyage. OVERALL A GREAT MOVIE AND YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER BUYING IT, BUT THERE ARE HAPPIER FILMS."
negative,"Save your money!! A Cheap Stinko!!: Big disappointment. During the simulated unsexy sex scenes the sound track changes to some awful detached music that kills the mood. The main charactor isn't even that good looking. You want ""HOT STUFF""? Then check out (the unedited or Unrated versions of)Emmanuelle, Emmanuelle 2, Dessert Hearts (the hottest lesbian scene ever made), Butterflies Are Free, Tender Cousins (the french language version), Carried Away, Lured Innocence. That's the ""A"" list of erotica. Warning don't view more than one of these at a time, they'll melt your VCR."
negative,"Amazon Scammed Me Of My Free Ticket: The movie is great in Blu-Ray as are almost all of them. Unfortunately, the Amazon version of this movie did not come with the movie discount for the new movie. Other stores have it for the same price so just buy it elsewhere and get the discount ticket. Wish Amazon would have disclosed that before I bought it."
negative,"Worst movie ever.: Some movies are so bad they're good. This isn't one of them. This movie was the kind terrible that I wish I could undergo selective electroshock therapy to erase any knowledge of its existence. I like all the stars in the movie, but now this movie is going to taint the experience when I see them in future movies.For a movie that faithfully follows a time-tested formula, it manages to tweak everything just wrong. The creepy psycho homicidal maniac isn't an interesting kind of creep. While you obviously hope he gets what's coming to him, waiting until the end of the movie is far too long. And what sort of accent or dialect is that supposed to be?I wish I would have stopped watching before the family dog was beheaded. I wish I had never seen it. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. Especially if you like Reese Witherspoon--a wonderful actress in the right role--you will wish you hadn't seen her in this dreck."
negative,"Disappointing: Virtuoso bass player (capable of great things with Chick Corea, Weather Report and Jan Garbarek to name a few) floats off on a fairly self indulgent set. Aided and abetted by Don Alias (great) and lots of keyboard overdubs it has its moments but ultimately is disappointing."
positive,"The Best: If your looking for an unbelievable emotional action/drama movie that lights up the screen and leaves your cheering for more, then Gladitor is the movie for you. Gladiator, in my opinion, is without a doubt the best movie i have ever seen. It has everything you want in a movie, a wonderful cast, big action scenes, and a kind of drama that leaves you with emotions you've never felt before in a movie. The main character, Maximus, (played by Russle Crowe),is the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an empire. Enough said. Russle Crowe gives an absolutely outstanding performance, he makes you believe and feel everything Maximus goes through in the film. The DVD is of this movie is awesome. Its loaded with tons of extras and is the best sounding DVD yet, with both dolby and DTS! Everyone must own this DVD, even if you dont have a DVD player, go out and buy one just for this movie! You wont be sorry! This movie rocks! The best movie ever!"
negative,Never got book: I purchased the Abnormal Psychology Student Workbook from this buyer and never got my book!! I attemped to contact the seller and they would not respond to my emails. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS BUYER!
positive,"4,5 stars Amazing album: If you like Slayer then this is a must album. The drums with Dave Lombardo are once again simply perfect. The songs are very rhytmic and aggressive. The sound of the guitars and the vocals are really great. Just buy this album ."
positive,Great!: This is a really cute book with beautiful pictures. I like the quotes that have been included as well.
positive,"Good for entertaining children...not so good for the environment: This ore was very good, it made quite a good addition to my science magic tricks that I do at childrens parties. however, it did manage to cause the hosts pet rabbit to start to chase and try and eat the children with its elongated teeth...The mother wasnt impressed and we swiftly had to put the rabbit down...however the radiation seems to have spread to their pond and I fear the frogs may start to glow in the dark and begin to eat things bigger than flys and spiders.All in all a great product, the explosion was brilliant and it really entertained the children. 4 stars for humour, entertainment and excitement, the 5th star deducted for animal and environmental issues"
positive,"Gorgeous Drawings and Fun Poem: Way out in the Desert, by Marsh and Ward, illustrated by Spengler, is a counting book featuring hidden numbers within spectacularly colored drawings of desert animals and their habitat. The verse is in rhyme and can be sung to ""Over in the Meadow,"" and the musical accompaniment is provided in the back of the story. I kind of chant this one to the kids and at the end of each page they look for the numbers hidden in the picture. Featuring plant and animal species which are native to the southwestern desert habitat, this book shows kids new animals they may not have seen before."
positive,"Works as well as OEM for less money.: I purchased this tensioner for my 2002 Honda CRV. The original tensioner had a rattle that developed in it. It was a pit of a pain to install even though it has only 3 bolts which hold it on, Hondas are just very crowded under the hood. Overall I highly recommend this Gates tensioner. It is very good quality and fixed my issue."
negative,"14 year-old reviewer: Polland, while delving nicely into the setting and background of ninth century Viking Age, lost me entirely with the child-like dialogue and weak story-line. Much of her writing was un-realistic and therefore highly un-appreciated. Her writing definately needs to be brushed up several notches. While she develops her characters personalties nicely enough she then twists them around in odd ways that make the book rather undesirable. The book was rather boring all in all, I would not recommend it for an enjoyable read. If your having your child read this book for school and learning, fine then, It does indeed have valuable information concerning ninth century background, but if you want a nice book to enjoy, this is not the one for you!"
positive,"a matter of perspective: Well, I beg to differ with the Amazon reviews. The thing that makes this extra creepy is that our young, uncertain heiress fully believes she can trust her new husband. As a matter of survival and love, she finds it impossible to believe any cruelty of him; it is less painful for her to accept her own insanity. The black and white media is used well here, and surely inspired Hitchcock......."
positive,A great book to read: this book is good i could hardly put it down. i spent most of the night reading it.
positive,Great movie: I saw this movie in 1962. I never forgot it. I purchased it recently because I wanted to use it to help educate my 10 year old grandson about WWII. I watched it with him and he got a lot out of it.
positive,"Good film holds up over time.: This is a very good film. Not a great film but a very good one - still. I had not seen ""Dirty Dancing"" in several years, but my wife had to have this comprehensive addition. It turns out to be fun to watch. Not just the film, but all the extras as well. It is also sad to think that at least five of the talented people who worked on the film are no longer with us - from director, Amele Ardolino to the incomparable Jerry Orbach. And then there is Patrick Swazee. I never truly appreciated him, but have developed a respect for his talents, both as an actor and as a dancer. ""Dirty Dancing"" is a rollicking, coming of age film, in which Jennifer Gray is perfectly cast as ""Baby."" We see the arc of her character, first as the tentative ""daddy's girl,"" and finally as the free-thinking woman she has become. And all with her original nose."
positive,Worthy of multiple readings: this book just comes more alive with each turn of the page. Normally I would not enjoy the format of this book however Ivey steals your heart in just a few short pages. This book was in good condition overall I was disappointed about the small rip in the cover and the big sticker but that imperfection has not taken away a wonderful story thank you
positive,"Halo the book what a good idea.: When i first played the game halo i loved it. The gameplay was great music was beutifully done and supprisingly the story was expertly told.So when a halo book came out i jumped on it to see the back round of the story. And behold it turned out great. But its no literary master piece. To compare it, its like reading a Tom Clancy novel. The author seems to have a technical name for just about every piece of equipment.So to round this review up if you like halo pick up the boxs set but be warned the series is written by two author and you may feel a chnge of writting inbetween the books, but its still all good."
positive,Works great!: This works great and keeps the coffee very hot. I wish the switch was on the front instead of the back for easier access but not a big enough deal to lose a star.
negative,"Somebody Gotta Put You Back Into Yo Place!: This CD set is false advertising. On the box it says over 3 hours of tracks, but none of the CDs lasts over an hour. That, and the fact that it appears like it was made by some amateur over the Web with various soundbytes snipped together (I'm exaggerating) are my biggest complaints.Only some of the tracks are even worth listening to. At first I found the dialogue somewhat fascinating, but it quickly faded into trite without much replay value. And beware, for some of the tracks are not even Beatle-related, it's just music from that time period.And I'm a big Beatles fan. My favourite albums are the White Album & Abbey Road."
positive,"The Essenes had it!: Gregg Braden has done vast research on the Essenes, a community committed to living according to spiritual laws in the time of Christ. He does a great job in carefully deciphering the power of prayer in their times and showing its unchanging nature with the ability to manifest even today. He writes of the importance of emotion and feeling the prayer; bringing it from the head into a matter of the heart. He talks of the possibility of living life in a prayer, which in fact is living a life in the space of continuous intentionality and co-creation with God. I found it to be an amazing book bringing home to me the importance of mindful living, of being present, aware. Of living in faith. I believe if one has truly embraced, incorporated - taken out of the intellectual mind - and encodified, better said, embodied its teachings, then one is living a transformed, powerful, God present life. I loved the book."
negative,"Nothing to Write Home About: Nice in theory, but doesn't really do the trick. We thought the longer shaft and small profile would make it easy to hold it in the right spot during intercourse to give me the extra zing necessary. The problem is, the surface is difficult to press up against the right spot. If the paddle had a nub on it or it was convex would make it a lot better.I was also disappointed in the speed/strength. In order to turn it on, you have to twist the base. The problem is, it goes from zero to full strength. No gradual increase. The strength is a little much to start off, and usually not enough after a short while. It would be nice if the power were adjustable.Positive: Very easy to clean - waterproof - inexpensive - slender design makes it easy to bring with you anywhere."
positive,"Infectious pop goodness!: I have been flipping through the reviews here, wondering if those who think VIVA is a superior disc are crazy?! While a fine debut, this album is so much better. I agree that the older version of ""Spoon"" from the SUPER RELAX e.p. is better than the newly recorded version. Otherwise, I think that this disc is a blast. Tracks like ""Lint Of Love"", ""King Of Silence"", and ""Moonchild"" are heads and tails above anything they've done before. I got an advance of this album back in April and I listened to it so much that I had to get another copy---I wore it out. This album deserves your time and your dollars. BUY IT!!!"
negative,"DIdn't work!: I bought this cable to connect my laptop to my wireless printer for a first time setup and this cable didn't work. I tryed this cable on my HD 52"" tv to connect something there & it didn't work there either. For the 2.80 I didn't even send it back. Just piched it. Wasn't worth the time to send it back to Amazon."
positive,The Hobbit: This was a fast pasted book. It was really exciting with many magical things that happen on the way. I thought it was the best book i have read so far. I liked it so much i bought the rest of the set. It was a very good book and i am looking foward to reading the rest of the series. The was by far the best book i have ever read.
negative,Disappointment: This book is not exactly to my liking. It could of been more interesting. It was only was in depth for certain topics. The main reason why I read the book was for the way it showed how even the most of different people can become the best of friends. George the main character Is Lenny's(the second main character)proctector. Lenny is not a person who can defend himself George looks out for him. One more reason why I read the book is because it shows how real friends protect each other and stand by each other in all circumstances no matter the obstacles. by TJones
positive,"A CD engulfed in GREATNESS !: This CD is amazing. Lhasa and her band demonstrate top musicianship combined with abundant passion. If you are a music fan with a large collection and taste of music, you must add this CD to your collection. It will be among your top 10 favorites. And that goes for music fans with modest CD collections too! And if you get a chance to see them perform live they are even better. I saw her last year in Montreal. Wow!"
negative,"Its all about the coffee: I bought a B70, after it was recommended to me by friends. My husband also has a similar one at work (the commercial B100? ). I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. I was very disappointed in the coffee. It tasted very weak, even on its smallest brew size. Only the ""extra bold"" varieties were acceptable. The hot cocoa was a joke! The water does not have enough time with the beans to extract good coffee flavor. I feel that it is not worth trying every K cup out there to brew 6 oz of OK coffee. Cuz its really all about the coffee. If you don't love it, you'll be back to buying it at your favorite coffee place. Yes, perhaps I had a dud. But my gut is telling me that I will feel the same way if I got another unit. I really wanted to LOVE it. It makes a lot of sense for our family. I wish that it would have worked. I feel it's too much money for what it actually delivers."
negative,"Overhyped: This movie was a disappointment. If you aren't a science-fiction fan (and maybe if you are) you don't want to see I, ROBOT. It is one of those movies that is slow to get the least bit interesting and truly escalates at the conclusion of the movie. While Isaac Asimov was a great science-fiction writer, I, Robot in its movie version just doesn't cut it. Not even Will Smith can lighten this bland movie, with the exception of the ending. It just lacks in being a truly exciting movie. It seems like for a while it is a mix of drama and science fiction, and then here comes comedy relief from Will Smith. It is way overhyped and could've definitely been better. 2 stars."
positive,"I recommened it!: I think this is a great book, it may be a lot like the other three New Generation Books, but It's got all of it in one book. And of course it's going to sound the same, it's by the same author. I highly recommend it!And also, for those wiccans/pagans who keep writing bad reviews, not to scare anyone, but you sound a lot like a (gasp!) christian...if you know what I mean..."
negative,"the songs are excruciating: this is a really annoying movie. my kids will be watching it in the next room and my husband and i will be in agony, having to hear the corny songs and contrived dialogue coming in through the open door. now, if my kids were rating this they would probably give it 5 stars, they love it. go figure."
positive,"Unevenly Fantastic: This album has some of the most fascinating,bizarre sound at some points and other songs are flat out boring. Si Senor The Hairy Grill being the masterpiece of the bunch with an organ biuldup to an amazing crescendo of screaming guitars (or is it just screaming?). Dr. Van Steiner, Goldrush, the latin~tinged La Habanera, and to a lesser extent, Oh Yeah, are all fine, and incredibly inventive tunes. Shirley Bassey is great in the Rhythm Devine, but the rest is a tad blah. Still worth it for all the greatness, and was a must buy for me as I used to have it in the 80's and really missed it. Jamming out to Si Senor was worth it all."
negative,"Disappointed: I, like a few other reviewers here, found the overly repetitive code snippets both confusing and, in most cases, utterly pointless.I have also yet to find any ""Tips"" which we are told are marked clearly throughout the book offering advice or demonstrating an easier way to do something (excluding the ""Tip"" that explains what ""Tips"" are!). Let me know if you find any others... Is this just another example of poor editing?It is a real pity, as overall the author presents some good examples. I would have liked the book to go a little more in-depth, but I guess there was little room left after the endless identical samples.2 stars simply because the book still manages to cover the basics, and the author shows plenty of promise for the future..."
negative,"VIPER: how can anyone with half a brain not see through this viper? not only is this book a farce, just look at him on tv, CLUE > he does NOT EVER SMILE, he just peers into the tv like some WWE Wrestler.another clue, he and his ""brethren"" are all peeps in the south, they believe just about anything.Matt 3:7But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, ""Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?Matt 12:34Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.Matt 23:33Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell?"
positive,The Last Unicorn: My youngest daughter and I used to watch this movie when she was little and this is the first time I've been able to find it for her. It's her 17th birthday soon and she will be tickled to pieces. Thanks for having it!!
negative,"Better get something that works!: We bought this DVD a year ago, and it's absolutely not worth what we paid for it. The DVD picture and sound are Ok, but this is the case with most DVDs. Now for the fun part: the remote is not designed to be used - there are rows of buttons, similar in size, and not very conveniently placed, so if you want to fast forward, pause etc. without looking at remote - forget it. It does not play SVCDs. I've gladly replaced Toshiba's remote with the universal, never to touch it again. But i can't do anything with mp3 playback - it totally lacks features: you can't program, you can't go directly to a certain track, you can't fast fast forward, it doesn' show titles etc. Finally, it comes with a disclaymer about what types of mp3s it is supposed to play. Well, it doesn't play even those, and it comes down to the fact that it won't play most of my mp3s at all. So, if mp3 is even slightly important to you, you will be better off with something else"
negative,"Pretty boring: This video only maintained my daughter's attention for about a minute (if that)! I found it to be pretty boring actually. There's hardly any talking, there is no music, and 'Eebee' and the lady do the same things over and over, so it gets boring after about the third time they do something (i.e. pouring cheerios out of a long container). I wish there was more talking/interaction or at least some music."
positive,"Mio My Son Was Unforgettable: I have never forgotten that book, and have been looking for it for years!!!You MUST bring it back in print!!!!PLEASE!!!!"
negative,Misleading Cover: I bought this DVD for my toddler because he loves Grover more than any character on Sesame Street. I was disappointed that Grover nor Cookie Monster who were both on the cover were in film at all. Very misleading! Also a bit heavy on kids talking and singing their favorite songs not as much characters and muppets as there should be. Not very entertaining as far as Sesame Street DVDs go. Better spending your money on another title.
positive,"Love, Love it!!: This was a very nice surprise. It is very good quality. My little grandpuppy cockerpoo looks adorable in it."
negative,what the heck on the price: i bought the movie when it came out for 17.99 and now they want 112.99 for it that a rediculous price that you be dumb to pay for wait it will be releace again
positive,"Baby oh babys good for my baby!: OK,listen up people! My daughter Lauren bought me this book for mothers day because of its cartoonish cover. But we all know the saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover!"" My daughter read it before me (let me mention shes ten and very mature)and liked it but when I read it we both agreed that it sort of overdid the sexual content, but is a good book none the less. It was funny, sad,outragious, and over all a sweet and amusing book. Mostly for adults but mature pre-teens can read it too! Wonderfulfor adults and kids who understand love and the situations in this book. And might I add that Lauren could not put it down for five seconds even if she tried! Same thing with me!Go buy it unless your BORING..."
positive,"Arabian Sands: I just completed this book. It was recommended as a way to understand the culture I was going to enter. I recently took an assignment in Doha, Qatar.I didn't know what to expect from the book, but I found it enlightening. The Arab culture has been turned upside down by the new found wealth that oil has brought.Thesinger was concerned about the affect of oil on the culture he fell in love with. I would say his fears have come true. The wealth has changed a simple culture of survival to one of entitlement.It is a good read and insight into the closed culture of the Muslim mind now forced to accept the Westerner that brings the technology and business acumen that helps them acheive the benefit this new found wealth provides. Unfortunately, it has created an arrogance in a culture formely proud of its ways.I believe the Arab still sees the Christian as an infidel and only accepts their presence as a necessity."
positive,Great selection: This pack comes with a wide variety of products. It is a great introduction to the Komenuka line. I really enjoyed how clean my skin felt after using the cleanser. The moisturizer is light and not at all greasy. I would recommend this line to anyone.
negative,I hit my b-70: For three months I loved this machine now I beat it with my can opener. It won't brew when it says it ready. Now I am searching for a better model or brand. Any ideas?
negative,"Super...cynical!: Paramount has soared to new heights of ""vulture-ness,"" patiently sitting on a branch for the last sap to buy this on Blu-ray before conveniently swooping in on said saps with the 3-D release. (Can't remember if Thor hit theaters as a 3-D movie, but I think it did, and Paramount is using the same release strategy there.) Please resist this strategy fellow would-be saps. The movie is a solid 3 (couple of weak plot lines)...the release strategy gets it rated a weak 1!!"
negative,"Absurd!: The mice don't even act like mice on this one, it shows how much time was put into the making of it. A few flat looking flight scenes can't make up for poor story telling."
positive,IT'S COOL BUT: I THINK THIS ALBUM IS COOL BUT THERE FIRST ONE WAS WAY METAL. IT KIND OF MAKES ME MAD THAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT THERE FIRST CD AND MANY PEOPLE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT AND ITS THERE BEST ONE.
negative,"A Stargate Movie: My thoughts on this are really simple. Go to Google and type in ""SG-1 Movie Sneak Peak"". Watch it. That's all you'll need to know. I sat through this DVD when the lights were out during Gustav. We'd been without power for three days and watched it from a laptop computer. The whole family loves Stargate and we were desperate for entertainment.During the movie...We. Were. Bored. To. Tears. I actually stopped watching at one point. Since I post my reviews on Amazon, I have to give it something. One out of five and again, that's only because I have to cough up something."
positive,"great buy for the cost: the tent is easy to put up. I bought this for my 1 year old grandson and he LOVED it. Yes, it may not last till he's 16 but it looks like he'll have a couple of years of fun."
positive,"Who Doesn't Love Pinocchio?: Got this CD collection for my son who loved Pinocchio as a child, and now he can share it with his little one."
negative,"Don't buy it! It freezes!: I purchased the pursuit pack from Amazon and although the first movie plays fine, the second and third pause,and freeze, on my DVD player! Before you say that it's my equipment, I'm playing it on a top of the line $200.00+, a year ago, Sony DVD player. I've tried cleaning the disc, restarting it, etc. Only thing left to do is return it."
negative,"Icky lyrics!: Tubthumber was the reason I wanted this cd and I got it. About 1,000,000 times on the radio plus 100 on the cd. Now I can't stand Tubthumper.The lyrics and music keep repeating themselves. All the other songs have bad lyrics that are negative too! This was not the best choice for me."
negative,"Painful: Glassjaw are horrible, i dont know what possessed me to pick this up, but i gave it one listen and then shut it in a draw. Nothing but typical nu-metal power chords and alot of forced wimpy screaming. Theres no melody or ryhthm, just chaotic noise."
negative,"Holy Canoli! 2 Crappy albums for the price of 1!!!!!!!!!!!!: Nelly sucks, we all know that's a fact. I'm glad the legendary KRS-ONE pulled his b!tch card, Nelly's feelings got hurt when he heard one of the pioneers tell him that he sucks. If nelly was a fat guy with a gheri curl he wouldn't sell any albums, since he's a fair-skinned, muscle bound tool, he sells. He seems to model himself after LL Cool J, who also sucks and had 1 good song his whole career. Don't encourage artists like Nelly by purchasing their records, it only insults the hip-hop community, which you probably would never understand if you're listening to this crap."
positive,A great performance: This was a a great performance. Tina is superb as are all her back up musicians. The production is great and the DTS sound is outstanding. You won't go wrong with this one.
negative,"Pass: The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. I am very dissapointed."
positive,"Bitch-in-a-day: First of all, I ordered this book on Wednesday and received it Friday (with standard shipping), so that was FANTASTIC. Second, I read this entire book in ONE day because I could not put it down. This GEM of a book described me so perfectly is was both eerie and very reassuring. For years, I kept wondering if it was ""me"" that was sabotaging my relationships and in many ways, YES, it was! But that's because I accepted the unacceptable instead of putting myself first and knowing that I deserve the best and don't have to settle for a guy's out-of-line behavior. I am so happy I ordered this book and HIGHLY recommend it to any women who finds herself trying too hard in an unfulfilling relationship. This book will leave you feeling strong, self-assured, confident, and IN CONTROL of your life and your happiness. AMAZING!!!"
negative,"A big disappointment - nothing new here.: I was very disappointed after listening to Faith Hill's new album ""Faith."" With the exception of the single ""This Kiss,"" which was what made me want to hear the rest of the album, all the songs sounded pretty much alike. How sad that all Nashville studios seem to turn out in their female artists are cloned, generic pop-like slush. I couldn't tell the difference between Faith and any other female singer on the radio with this album. An overall disappointment in song choices and performance. Too bad, because I really wanted to like it."
positive,"These Cats Rock: There are groups that rock and then there are groups that really rock. Little Charlie and the Nightcats do the latter. This ablum is a must buy. Take it to a friend's party and plug it in his/her CD player and watch the place start to jump. This one is definitely a keeper and there is not one clunker in the whole playlist. There are three must play songs on the album. These are That's Big, Coastin' Hank and Go On If You're Goin' I recommend that you check out the rest of their albums if you want to hear more of their stuff."
positive,"Equal to 'Panzer General' or 'Advance Wars': No resource gathering in this game !You start with an army and capture train station, factories, airports, which you can then use against the enemy!A pc/dos classic."
positive,history: I am a history buff so the movie was just great. The love they ended up with is not found in this world anymore.
negative,"Truly scary and horrifying... just not in the intended way .: I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. For the first time in my life, I was part of a theater full of people who began screaming comments at the screen as the movie went on, Mystery Science Theater 3000 style, with not one patron becoming upset.That's how bad this POS is. I did enjoy it, because some of the people in the crowd were really funny and it made this awful waste of time palateable. To this day, my friends and I use ""Constantine"" as a punch line.Run, screaming from this ""film."""
negative,"Smells like dollar signs...: Have you ever heard the song 'Milk It'? It was written for this exact reason. Or 'Rape Me'? ""Its so relieving to know that your leaving as soon as you get paid"" Francis farmer? You know when you buy this, some record exec is making a buck on a dead persons name. But hey we all know that suicide sells."
positive,"from the first......: fantastic LP i've owned since new & now replacing with a new copy. gayle moran's haunting vocalizations, chick's keys, this a wonderful album."
positive,"I love it: I really find it much better than the M3. You just have to pass the blade less times on your skin than with M3.It's a little bit expensive, but it worth it."
negative,"If there was a negative star rating....: Don't waste your time watching this movie. It's time out of my life that I will never get back. My thought, after it was all over, was how could he not be thoroughly embarrassed having something this incredibly useless out for public consumption with his name on it? Unless you're obsessed with Curt Cobain and would watch anything remotely having to do with him, just don't bother."
negative,This arrived broken: This item arrived broken. I had it shipped for Christmas but it was defective and now I have to pay $2.50 more if I want to return it. Hardly worth my trouble.
negative,"Love the toy....Still Disappointed: Before I tried to attach this toy to my sons crib, I really loved how it worked. I thought the sounds and the music were great. However, I am very disappointed that because this is our first child who is 3 weeks old, and we purchased a brand new crib, we cannot use this toy. It will not attach to new cribs that have wider top bars. I can use it while he is laying on his play mat and lean it up against something, but I am still bummed because when we were shopping we were looking for a crib toy specificaly. I usually love Fisher Price items, but not this time! They need to keep up with changing models of things such as cribs!"
negative,movie the chiefs: i still haven't received the movie. i have not received one word if going get it or am i going to get a refund. i will never order a movie from another buyer.
negative,Terrible stinker!: What a stupid movie! There was nothign admirable in the main character. What the heck was she thinking in sleeping with a man she hadn't even known for a day! That is not realistic at all. The whole storyline had no logical sequence. Stay away from this movie.
positive,a good memory: I got this card and I am completely satisfied with it. It has had no problems and I cannot remark on its speed as this is the first compactflash card i have had. I just cannot figure out how to get the rebate for it yet.
positive,super product: keeps my water perfect and prevents viruses in my tank. which makes keeping and spending less on my tank enjoyable and improves the long life of my angelfish.
negative,"Tight around the toe and really slippery bottom: I bought these thinking they are quite beautiful and have the low heels I am looking for - surely I can walk around town all day in these. Unfortunately that's not the case. Even though the rest of the shoe fits fine my toes are really cramped in these. In addition to the tight front, the bottom of the shoe is made of something that feels like soft plastic, it gets absolutely no traction whatsoever. My feet slips walking on carpet!!! Living in a city with hills I am afraid to walk either up or down the hills for fear I'll slip and fall. Thanks a lot for forcing me to pick out only flat roads to walk on."
positive,"So far so good: Great item, keeps my coffee warm throughout the work day. I do wish there was an automatic shut off after so long, though because I get paranoid about that kind of thing."
negative,"Duller than dirt: I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students. I don't know who suffered more, me or them.To be fair, as one of America's first novels, it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job.On the other hand, it is excruciating to read. There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad."
negative,"Toy doesn't work: Dean Martin doll plays the music, but mouth doesn't move and arm moves sometimes but not others. Would have liked to have known this before I made the purchase."
negative,"Interesting, depressing, sometimes funny: I am open minded enough to see where some people would enjoy this. I'm a fan of dark comedy, but I need a little more kindness and a little less indifference and a little more depth and humanity than the Sedaris family exhibits. Fans of the movies ""Happiness""and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse,"" would probably enjoy Sedaris. I find him interesting, but depressing. I did laugh hysterically at the 6-8 black men story. That was a big relief after the selfish, sad lives I kept reading about before that story came up about 2/3 of the way into the book."
positive,"Starlight: Starlight is a really good book. All the clan cats are in a new place which they have to ge used to.The clans also have to seperate after being with eachother for so long. Squirrelpaw, leafpaw, and Brambleclaw have to face problems that they will have never even thought about. Good reading."
positive,"Excellent neo-soul and hip hop: This artist and her CD is the best hidden teasure that I have discovered all year this disc has been in my cd player since it has came into my house. I highly recommend this artist and her work the material is soulful, sensitive and yet funky the lyrics are positive, mature and clean. Question will sooth, groove and move you and I have to mention that the pictures of her on the cover and the inner booklet tells me that this fine lady has the full package beauty and talent."
positive,"Best Uranium Ore I ever bought: I recently bought this product because I read in an online article that it can help with male enhancement. I grew at least three inches overnight!!! Although, the only setback is that I now have pustules growing out of my eyeballs making it very difficult to see. All in all: worth it."
negative,Gangster Wars(edited): This is not the Gangster Chronicles series. The original Gangster Wars was released on 2 VHS cassettes( part 1 and 2) this is not it. It is a cut down editors version and is a mess without any continuity and should not be sold as such.
positive,Metal all the way.: This band has some very good music. The track 'Let Me Be Your Tank' has to be my favorite off the entire album.
negative,the shaggs: This is like hearing children play music for the first time. This is talentless on many levels. waste your money if you must.
positive,"Balanced, a bit dry but easy to understand...: ""A recently released University of Minnesota studyestimates that, for example, 93 percent of felons of all races favored Bill Clinton in 1996""Uh--New York reader-reviewer..is this because they like to vote for one of their own?I enjoyed this book and felt it showed both sides of the battle. The liberals will always think they had the election stolen from them and the conservatives will always feel the right man won.I would LOVE to see a book written that discusses ALL the goings-on that happened with the elections, past and 2000. The vote-buying in Chicago, the Haitians being helped to vote a straight Dem ticket, the exchange of votes for liquor or cigarettes.But this book answered a lot of my questions and I will recommend it to others."
negative,"gor. hmmm: john norman needs help. he has obviously long-sheltered a fondness for the use of 'binding fibre' on helpelss women. the climax of the sex scenes , basically , was tying them up. i wait his next publication with baited breath.. and a forlorn hope of no rope."
negative,"Dull and Annoying: A small town girl who comes to the city to become a star is a premise as old as the cinema. Coyote Ugly is just repeating this, with a particularly annoying character who suffers from one of the most demented looking cases of stage fright I've ever seen.Jerry Bruckheimer usually does good films, but this is a case in which I would love to ask him what he was thinking. The only attraction to this film is a bunch of girls dancing on top of the bar, and the singing of LeAnn Rimes. He could easily have just made a few music videos and dispensed with the vehicle for presenting them. It would have done us all a favour."
negative,"Sexist film: Okay this is just another film for guys to watch hot girls strut around. There is supposedly some kind of moral to this story. The only moral I can see is ...when you don't have a big enough brain, use your bod to get ahead. Screw college, screw learning there is more to you then your looks... looks don't fade, they last forever! (right) My boyfriend doesn't understand why I don't want to watch this movie every time it comes on tv. Because it perpetuates a thing women have been trying to get away from for thousands of years; being judged as people who will use their looks instead of their brains to get what they want, being judged as nothing but a body and no more. Any THINKING woman will not like this film and will not want any young girls she knows to watch it, either. It is not a good example for the young women of today."
positive,"Great Read!: I am probably the only person on this planet who has not read Parker, though I know Spenser from TV and enjoy the character. I picked up this book because I like to read series from book #1 and I enjoy female protagonists; this one filled the bill. I thoroughly enjoyed Parker's style and the characters, especially the dog, since I have one just like him at home. I truly hope this is the beginning of a new series and that it isn't a one-time only for Parker's friend, Helen Hunt."
positive,"Fabulous...: This book was awesome. A fast paced, riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me. I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers, Feehan fan or not. But be warned, by the time you turn the last page of this book you will be hooked on Christine Feehan."
positive,think deep: i rate good because i consider a good book to read and makes pleople reflect and thinkit was used but in exellents conditions. thanks
negative,"No Disrespect: You talk about bigots! We have adopted 3 black children, 'tho we already have 5 biological. We are so darn happy that we have saved our 3 from the horable, unetical, imoral life that is epicted in this book. If that is how Sister has lived her life, we see absolutely no reason why she would brag about it. Also, while white students are worrying about their student loans, and wondering how in the world they will ever be able to pay them back, little or nothing was said about the African-American students concerns about their pay-back. Oh, yes, I forgot ""We Owe You""(?) Great that Sister Souljah is trying to help her ""brothers"" and ""sisters"", but maybe she should start with teaching them some morals, and maybe cleaning up her act while she is at it. Sister is a talanted writer. We hope that someday she will find something more uplifting to write about."
positive,"Miracle Greens: Excellent product. Believe it or not, it actually tastes pretty good, even though they suggest taking it with apple juice - it actually has a sweetness of it's own. To me, it's the BEST green drink product on the market."
positive,"Very Good, But Not For Immature Children: This was an excellent book, probably my favorite of the first four. I read it when I was 11 years old, and have re-read it so many times the book is practically destroyed. However, this book, while I as a 6th grader enjoyed it, is not for the immature child. Think carefully before you tell anyone about the series, especially your child, because it contains a few explicit scenes, which increase as the books go on. Another word of advice- if you don't like a lot of details in a book, don't read this, because the author details surroundings and histories frequently. However, I thought the details were fascinating. Jean Auel is a wonderful writer, and I eagerly await the fifth book."
positive,"A good fit: Just received my first pack and am so pleased am ordering another. Very good quality, sized correctly, quite comfortable. Hopefully they hold up for many months if not years of use."
positive,"Great with your TiVo!!!!!: This is a MUST have if you have broadband capability. I had the telephone wires running all over the place. This is SOOOO simple to set up and use. And the cool thing about it is that if you have 2 Tivos, you can send programs from one tivo to the other... and you can also have your PC set up as a server and listen to music from your PC on your TV! It's great!"
negative,"COUNTERFEIT: These are, hands-down, undeniably, without a doubt, counterfeit blades.The construction on each blade is cheap, so much that the individual detailing blade does not exist. It is simply a hard edge of the blade housing.Upon using a fresh, clean, new cartridge, it feels like running a rusty can across your skin: scratchy, irritating, cheap.THESE ARE NOT GILETTE.I am seeking what further steps I can take to hold Amazon, LLC accountable for selling me a fake item that poses a risk to my health."
negative,"Broken on arrival, inferior contruction: The right eye piece was falling off of my binoculars when it arrived. Careful inspection shows that this was only weakly attached ever and it looks like glue or whatever was supposed to hold it on melted during shipment. It is 110 degrees here but binoculars should hold up to that. I agree with the other reviewers that comment on the lack of quality in the manufacturing of this product. I think I will go with Leupold or some other brand. With binoculars I think you really do get what you pay for and these were too good of a deal."
positive,"The Grass is the Finest!: Dolly reaches out the bluegrass world and hauls in a huge win for herself and the rest of us. Why she didn't sing and stretch like these years ago is beyond me, but she soars along with the hot group of musicians and singers with her. I have been playing this CD for months since I got it and I can't seem to get enough. I would have loved to see her tour with this ensemble of musicians with her, but I think she only played in Nashville last January.Here's to hoping she records more bluegrass, but until then I'll give The Grass is Blue another spin."
positive,"GREAT BOOK FOR TALENT SHOWS!: My elementary school kids have used this book for YEARS to prepare skits for their school talent show, church talent show, and 4-H programs. The skits are easy and most require little speaking which makes it PERFECT for young children... or we adults who can't remember speaking lines! Youth leaders or school teachers would find this book very useful... I have loaned my book several times and am always careful to make sure it comes back to me because this is one that I DON'T want to lose!"
negative,"Mediocre: I loved this vacuum at first, but less than a year later I am shopping for a new vacuum. I regularly banged out the filters to extend the life, but nothing helps. We have two kids and a husky, so we probably should have saved longer and bought something more tough."
positive,"flat and tone stomach!! reneemariejones@aol.com: This product is the best. I have been on it for 3 years. It takes six weeks to notice a difference.,and. 6 months to see a difference. The key to lose fat is toning; this product does helps with that! As we age our body needs protien to supply energy, and balance our homones. I take this product during the day and one packet at night. I am 42 years old : My results are a flat tone stomach., younger skin., and consistant weight of 125. I also take nutracutics vitamins. Email me if you have questions."
positive,"Great!: I have read # 1,2,3 and i'm reading number 4. The past books have been VERY good! ...i reccomend this book for ages 11+ but not younger than that, because there is a little violence and gore. A bit scarry too, but very good! I also reccomend the book ""The Silver Kiss"" its also a good book about vampires"
negative,"Not satisfied with the book.: Well, initially when I got the book everything looks good until the day I began to use the book for class asignment. I found that the pre chapter and chapter 1 was teared out. I'm dissapointed because I can't use the book anymore."
positive,"Great Value for Less Money: I searched hi and low for a desk that would work in my son's small room -- I wanted a desk made of wood and available in honey finish to match his other furniture with a small hutch (as a large hutch wouldn't work)...and at a reasonable price. The Kidcraft Avalon Desk is perfect! I took off one star because I didn't realize how short it was - ok for my 9 yr old son now, but as he grows up I'm afraid he will outgrow the desk. It would be great if Kidcraft offered taller replacement legs so that the desk could be raised higher as your child grows. I feel the desk is sturdy enough to go off with my child to college if were not for the short height! Dear Kidcraft...please make taller replacement legs so that the desk can be ""normal"" desk height for later years, making is a ""Teen""kraft desk ;-). Thanks."
negative,"Hutton's lost cause: Oscar winner Timothy Hutton stars in this spanish made film.He plays Science Fiction Author David Norton. He is invited to an island conference. He takes his girl friend, asks her to marry himA DVD appears in his room and she commits suicide..and then more people start dying. He is usually in control, suddenly life takes a nasty spin.Hutton takes the lead with this weak script. The plot wears thin after the first 30 minutes and then it starts to drag. There is no sub plots. The suspense of this film feels disjointed and starts to bore. There are no thrills to capture an audience. Towards the end, Hutton looks bored as lead and the film falls apartTry to miss this one in your video store, until all the other good films are rentedBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
positive,"BEST FACE LOTION EVER: I totally agree with the positive reviews above. Until I found this face moisturizer, I had terrible problems with flaky dry patches combined with oily places. I tried lots of other moisturizers but nothing provided the kind of complete solution for my complexion. I LOVE THIS LOTION and can't believe it's been discontinued. It is not at all greasy - it feels light and soothing all day long. I also hope Eucerin reconsiders it's decision regarding this amazing product."
negative,"unusable, avoid it: After 1st wash, even before 1st use. It became unusable: full of tiny cotton balls on the surface; shrank 20% at least; tended break. Note that I did follow the wash direction.Now I have to cut them into pieces and see if they are any good for wiping dirt off my car. It not even worth the return postage."
positive,Keeps the kids entertained: My kids are young (girl-3 and boy-5) but they love going through the pictures and asking me to read about each superhero's powers. Really feeds their imagination. My daughter favorite super power is strength (like in the Incredible Hulk) and my son's is producing fire. Mine is flying. Wooooosh!
negative,"Ron: Not as pictured. Doesn't seal well for the launch and so it is pretty much worthless. I had the one pictured when I was a kid and was pretty excited to order and now left with disappointment. Order what you see and you may get something else and cheaply made. Maybe should have bought this back in 2006 when it got better reviews. Amazon, please take this off your site!! It indeed is less than a quality product and your company is deceiving those who buy."
negative,"Michael Tyler (Canton, Ga.): This item is not worth the money. It takes between 80 and 120 minutes to cook brown rice. My $49.00 Sunbeam steamer that I purchased 5 years ago cooks rice much better than the Zojirushi."
positive,"Wonderful story: Because we have hollyhocks in our flower gardens, I purchased this to read to my granddaughters. They loved it, and we could then watch the progress of our own hollyhocks in the yard. Perhaps this year we will send some seeds home to be planted at our son's house!"
positive,Good season of Smallville: Im a huge Smallville fan ever since the first season although I think the season is good and has a good story I miss some of the older characters. But other than that worth the money!!
negative,"Worthless Coffee Pot: I bought this product to have a small coffee pot in the office. However, when brewing, this pot somehow always gets significant amounts of coffee grounds into the pot, regardless of how the filter is arranged. Total waste of money, I'll be throwing this away and buying another."
positive,"Magical Realism at its best: I guess that is where this book is usually categorized in. Apparently, Gabriel Garcia Marquez popularized the genre. I loved the book and would put it in the top five of my list. There are people who I've talked to that thinks it was confusing or complicated. That was not the case for me. It's true that there were many characters (and it does not help that a lot of them are named similarly). But, I think each of them is distinct and was developed very well. The book is not about the town of Macondo...it's about the people who lived there. And, you will be able to relate to the book because of its very human characters set in an environment that is often very real but occasionally eerily surreal. That's magical realism for you."
negative,"what a waste of paper: This is an absolute waste of paper and money. There are very few interesting facts, historical or other wise, about redheads in this book. It is mostly overly wordy personal anecdotes of the author.Let me stress the overly wordy part.I'm still looking for that book that I had hoped this one was...you know the one about the myths, beliefs, facts, etc of redheads...of which I am proudly one..."
negative,boring: If you like this album you will probably like any other mediocre band out there now. It is the same recycled music over and over. Over singing and generic guitars make for a bland album. Just my opinion.
positive,"Good: smallville is one of my favorite shows, so i can't say nothing negative about it.. at least of the top of my head lol. the product came onetime, if i remember correctly i think i did the one-day delivery.. so that was good."
negative,"Faulty product: I have been through two of these, each one only worked for a few months before going bad. After three months and only sporadic use, the first one I bought started cycling on-off continuously. This isn't apparent unless you are using it while plugged in, but the battery icon will show it is charging for a couple of seconds, then flip back to the battery icon for a couple of seconds and so on. I contacted the company, which confirmed it was faulty, so I sent it back to them for replacement. I received the replacement from Macally and after a couple of months, the second one started doing the same thing. I have read this is a pretty common occurrence with this product. I suppose there is a reason that it's a third the cost of the Apple product."
positive,Fun fantasy: I love the story line of this movie - a male Fairy Godmother! What fun. And Kathleen Turner as the 'wicked witch'. What a fairy tale concept.
positive,"Coyote Alert!: I thought this film was great, especially as there is a real bar in NY like the one in the film. Coyote Ugly is an excellent film for pretty much everyone to see, and the CD is also good. If you dislike this film, then why are you looking at buying it anyway???"
negative,"THIS BOOK SUCKED!: This book really sucked! I don't know about the cassetes, butI can say for a fact that the book was so awful I was boredpractically to tears. That's not to say that it was quite asbad as ""Weatherhawk"", but it was pretty close! Don't botherto buy or borrow ""Stealth"". Spend your money on more worthwhilebooks."
negative,Uhhh.: I can not be certain but I don't think the other reviewers and I saw the same movie. Acting was terrible video was terrible plot was terrible. Good try I guess.
positive,Great for 2.63: I got this in the mail and it was about what I thought it would be a cheap but working cable. I takes about 1 minutes to warm up when you use it then it works fine but in the first minute or so the picture will go fuzzy then perfect the fuzzy
negative,Not what was advertised: This book wasn't the edition that it said it was. On top of that it was full of markings with highlighter and pen. The pages were in good shape except for the writing everywhere. I'm very disappointed
negative,"Frustrated in my search: Disappointed in the viewer comment on poor quality transfer from VHS to DVD which has discouraged me from completing my contemplated purchase of the DVD. Will keep looking elsewhere for a quality transfer.Am also stymied in not being able to find a CC version. I show these wonderful old film noirs to my 92 year old Dad who is deaf; without CC, it's impossible..."
negative,"Do not be suckered!: There is nothing in the title or on the cover to indicate that this is a book whose sole intention is to convert you to Christianity.The first two pages are about anger, but by page three you are being told that Jesus loves you.Sad, that religious people feel the need to deceive others in order to get out their message."
negative,worst strings I've ever owned in over 40 years of playing: I bought 4 sets of these. The wound 3rd string broke on every set in a short time. One 1st string broke when I was stretching it.
positive,"Bloom's challenge: How Forgiving Are You?: The characters, on quick glance, may seem crazy, immoral, half-witted; but Amy Bloom's writing and attention to detail stirs the longings we all have as imperfect people, exposes our neurotic, constant need never to make mistakes, and forces us to find compassion for even the most flawed judgement. Ms. Bloom does the impossible: love overcomes infidelity, the nut is the only one who's sane, and grief excuses our mistakes. This book is a rare, precious find"
positive,"Quite a Hoot!: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a wonderful diversion from some of my more esoteric readings. If you want to pontificate with some interesting tales at your next dinner party, regale them with any that you find in this fascinating tome and you will be the center of attention. A fun read!"
negative,It was a very good description of life during anti-social ti: It was a very good description of life during anti-social time
negative,"Smokey and the Bandit Pursuit Pack: I ordered the 3 movie Pursuit Pack because it stated that all 3 movies were included. It was a birthday present, I paid additional fees to have it overnighted 2 days, it came in 5. Amazon did fix this immediately and resent another DVD asking me to wait until I received it to send the original one back. The 2nd one came the very next day but... it was just like the first. In it's original packaging yet only included sequels 2 and 3... sending it back and reordering the original alone..."
positive,Batman Begins Review: I love the story very close to the comic book. I like the price I paid for it. It is a good buy.
positive,"Spencer Brade, MD: I was so happy to get the copy of a book I had read 60-some years ago. It was in very good condition and I will thank the lady who sent it."
negative,"book was in new condition...: This book is bad. The socialist Utopia taken to new heights, socialist USA. I knew this was a book highlighting the greatness of communal society, it was worse than most because it tries to paint the America of the past with a Marxist brush. It attempts to place liberty into a socialist utopia where, even in this complete work of fiction, it can't live. There is nothing particularly interesting or new here. Stick to the classics if u are amused by the socialist ideology."
negative,"If this is good Trek, blech!: Although I am a fan of all the Star Trek TV series, I only read the occasional Trek book. If this book is typical or considered fine, I'm glad I haven't read more. The characters were flat, much of the dialogue bland - and this based on characters with rich, complex development from TV! I realize that authors' have limited liberty to work with the main characters from the series, but numerous times I nearly set the book aside out of disappointment. Spoiler Alert! Quick - how do we save Deanna from the monstrous serpent? How else: her empathic powers convince the beast ""We are friends from long ago."" Books such as this serve best as a bad example: here's how you don't do it. Although it's been many years since I read it, I'd recommend ""Vendetta"" over ""Genesis Force"" any day."
negative,"ok if you like adventure...: For english class we had to read Lord of the Flies by Golding.. It was an ok book... if you like adventure stories... personally i dont. however Goldings use of symbolizm is great. The book sickened me at certain parts. The descriptions were great but after reading an entire chapter and then some more descriptions, it gets sort of boring. However i did like how Jack and Ralph TRIED to get along in the beggining you know BEFORE Jack went crazy. I also liked Goldings purpose of this book... how deep down, we are savages. And he was right."
negative,"Broke 3rd time out, destroyed back of Prius: We bought this for our Prius only a few months ago, the third time out, the strap broke sometime during our drive and dented the hatch and bumper badly (the bikes hung on til we pulled over). Thousands in damage, don't know if Saris is going to help with the damage but BUYER BEWARE!! 2 adult and one kid bike. Terrible terrible rack."
negative,"MR Coffee mug warmer: I've been mostly pleased with items from Amazon, but need to say the Mr Coffee mug warmer was a real disapointment in that it only keeps coffe or any liquids slightly warmer than lukewarm. Picked up a second-hand Rival mug warmer and it works great! OH Well"
positive,"Recommended version of a classic Christmas tale: All the text, good illustrations, easy navigation. Can't go wrong with this version of this Christmas classic. Probably the best one at this low price."
positive,"There are only a couple of tracks that aren't brill!!: Almost every single song on this excellent album is worth 5 stars by itself! There is only about one song that totally does my head in as it is really repetitive, but don't let that put you off!! My personal favourite on the album is 'When I Grow Up'"
negative,"Long sentences that are extremely confusing.: Bad book overall, only interesting about the themes of discrimination"
positive,Cultivators Choice: Want to learn where to get potent seeds? Fancy breeding your own line of marijuana in your greenhouse or bedroom? Are you looking for the ins and outs of grow room design? This book has left no stone unturned. I love the way this book is designed ( like a growing plant ). There is good and new information everywhere in the book. You will grow some fat budz with it. There are illustrations to help you through some of the harder set ups. This grow book comes with online product support. Can you believe it?? ??There is where you should be going. Just get the darn book already ....
negative,evil wrapper...: My girlfriend was gonna put one on me and cut her finger with the wrapper. Blood fell on my night stick.Killed the mood man.THANKS ALOT CROWN CONDOMSquantity and price is great.used the other 59 condoms within 2 weeks:)
positive,"Trip down memory lane with many NEW twists and turns: While this book is certainly not the definative baseball book, it certainly gives ANY reader the chance to enjoy the nuances of the sport. Jordan allows the reader into many of his most intimate thoughts about his life, as well as, his baseball life and journeys. Much the same as Field of Dreams was more than a baseball movie, A Nice Tuesday is much more than a baseball novel. Feel his love for the game and his love for pitching a baseball. He depicts his life in and out of baseball with such deep passion and conviction that it is impossible to come away from this book with anything other than a strong feeling of warmth for the sport and the author."
positive,"Better each time: Though perhaps less full of quick wit than P&P, Persuasion is a better, more refined book. Anne is a less indulged Lizzie. Having never been her father's favorite she has learned a subtler, more patient way of living. A better role model, though more difficult to follow, her joys are truer for having been harder won."
positive,"a must see: If you haven't seen this awesome movie, you are missing out. It is very compelling. It is one movie that makes me cry. Great movie about humans."
positive,"Kidneys, infidelity, and parenthood: Reading Ulysses is a different experience for everyone. One thing is for certain - it is a difficult,long read. It is also, strangely, very hard to put down and it leaves you searching for meaning and just in a state of complete wonder. Amazingly, Joyce is able to convey each character's thoughts and dialect in a way that has never been achieved by anyone else. It feels almost as if each character was composed by a different author - they are so unique and detailed. Though I cannot express much of anything that has not already been said - let me make one recommendation to the reader of Ulysses - read something to help you through it (even cliff notes) and also read the Odyssey again - you will find this very helpful in navigating through this remarkable text."
negative,Terrible beds: I ordered these beds because my grandkids were sleeping on the floor and couldnt afford real beds and in less than 2 months both beds have popped. They didnt jump on them they just lost air seemed like the seams were the problem. 1 bed was replaced but the other remains not replaced. I would never buy these type of beds ever again or this brand. They were not cheap and I cant afford to replace them again. So now they are back to sleeping on the floor again. I heard they were good or I would not have ordered them. I am terribly disappointed.
positive,"Barnett Outdoor Carbon Crossbow 22- Inch Arrow/w/Field Point (5 Pack): These are Sleek, Smooth, and Straight and VERY ACCURATE. I've shot these over and over and they are a ""Real Steal"" at their price, I WILL be purchasing more of these real soon, I'd recommend these to anyone who wants a High Quality Crossbow Arrow for an Economical Price. Buy'em Buy'em Buy'em!!!!"
negative,"not what people think: this book is very mediocre, it has very little correct information. the practice test especially the math parts have a lot of questions that are irrelevant when taking the actual test none of the questions you have practiced for math is on the actual test. the info about the time and amount of questions in the test are correct but be warned. Im sure there are better ways to improve your math skills. don't waste your money."
negative,"Not bad but...: I thought the script and most of the acting was pretty good. But that teenager(""C"") can not act at all. Where did they get this guy?He ruined the whole movie for me. Worth watching though..."
negative,"it's not scary as you thought: this is so called the new remake of the older Mummy Films.The acting is really bad, cause the director concentrated most only in the special effects.The one truth Mummy movie is ""THE MUMMY 1932 with Boris Karloff as Imhotep""."
positive,"Good Movie!: This is a really good, solid horror movie. If it had been title something else, like Masks, or just Season of the Witch, it probably wouldn't get trashed so much. But it will live in infamy because it carries the Halloween title, without Michael Myers. If I was John Carpenter, I would go back and shoot a couple of insert shots of Michael Myers skulking down a street and insert it back into the film,and call it a SPECIAL EDITION. ""HERE's YOUR FREAKIN MICHAEL MYERS!, you Brats!"
negative,"Soooooooooo... BORING!!!!: When I got this, it looked like an exiting adventure story. I've got into about a forth of the book and I can't read any more! I think I'll bore myself to death! My parents forced me to read this, and I can't imagin how bad the next one, Eldest, is! DO NOT GET THIS BOOK> IT'S A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
negative,"Arrived broken!: Well, this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" kind of reviews. Didn't pay much, didn't expect much, but basically functional would've been nice. The generator came broken (probably a miswire internally). Yep, I checked the outs with a meter... and if I finagled the probe inside and touched the right spot, I got voltage. Just not externally. Too much trouble to return it and convinced my 10-year old to go with a real light powered by batteries."
positive,Anger Workbool: A friend suggested this book - I have gained a whole new insight to some of the issues I have been dealing with in my life. This book has helped me put a lot of my life experiences in perspective and has helped me understand myself and others so much better. Even if you don't think you have anger issues (which I didn't) this will definitely have an impact and be effective in understanding anger and it's complexities. A must read!!
positive,Great Kindle read!: I don't know what is soo fancy and enhanced about this. But it was clean and easy to read on the kindle. I would recommend this to anyone who was in to LOTR.
negative,Quantitative Evaluation: Audio Merits:7/10;Video Merits:9/10;Scenario Merits:3/10;Cinematograhic Merits:5/10;Musical Merits:5/10;Overall Artistic Performance:6/10;DVD Extras:6/10;Recording Total Quality:5/10. Professor's Recommendation:Worst of all Joan of Arc titles. Don't buy it.
negative,"Good opener but I quickly lost interest: whatever these reviewers are on, I want some. This movie dragged. I kept waiting for something cool to happen, but they just kept talking to eachother over the mic-bla bla bla blaaa. I wouldn't know if the conversation was good because I just fastforwarded all of it after a while. A real bore."
negative,"25% Less Movie than the Original!: The original theatrical version of this film was NOT widescreen. For this DVD, Disney took a non-widescreen movie and MADE it widescreen. What does this mean for you? Less movie! Since they cannot ""add"" footage to fill in the sides of a widescreen TV, the only way they can do it is to zoom into the picture and crop out the top and bottom! This destroys any sense of composition those poor layout artists worked so hard to achieve, and is essentially like watching the film with your eyes half closed. In order to fill your widescreen television, and tout this release as ""Enhanced for 16x9 Televisions,"" Disney thought it was a good idea to bring you 25% LESS movie. If viewed on a standard TV, you now see black bars at the top and bottom of our screen, where there were none before!Get the ""Disney Gold Classic Collection"" version if you want to see the film in its entirety."
negative,"You don't know what you are getting.: At this writing date, the listed manufacturer on the Amazon page for this fan is ""Alpha and Omega Computer,"" which is a wholesaler of fans. Their website lists the manufacturers of their 60 mm x 25mm ball-bearing fans as Sanyo, Evercool, and Sunon. These are all decent fan brands, and they have a range of specs for airflow (cfm), speed, and noise. However, the Amazon page for this fan currently lists no brand or specs, so you won't know which fan you will get. I received a 24 cfm Sunon fan with 34 dbA, which is quite loud for a small fan, and is the loudest fan that Alpha and Omega carry for this approximate cfm. For example, there is Sanyo fan with a higher cfm at 28 dbA, which is significantly quieter. So if noise matters to you, I'd buy a fan with the manufacturer and specs listed, otherwise you may find the noise very annoying."
negative,"Add To Cart.... NO!: This movie made me want to scrape turd-shaped photons off of the back of my retinas. Anyone who praised this dogpile is either struck by the popularity of the title or saw it when they were 5 years old and are still trying to hold onto a simpler time in their life. The plot was paper-thin and the acting made me want to wear one of those Silver Shamrock masks in the hope my life would end at any second while watching this shameful reminder that ANYONE can make a movie.I love the Halloween Series (most of it, anyway) but this is crap. Pass on this one, kids!Edit: This movie has nothing to do with John Carpenter or Michael Meyers! Isn't this helpful info?? This movie isn't good. Cult classic maybe, but it is no Evil Dead. Period."
positive,"The 80s were crap, this album is good: What I remember about eighties music was a few good singles here and there with a nice sound but rubbish albums. Darkdancer is like all the good bits of the 80s with better production and done by someone with some musical talent. Although there's some good pop songs on this album, others unfurl subtlely, even majestically. Nostalgia aside, what makes the record good is the music itself. Now that I think of it, there's loads of 80s compilations coming out at the moment. I hope this doesn't mean a full-on revival is on the cards. The charts in the 1980s were poor. That's that. It's not clever to like it now; at least Le Conte or whatever his name is has some skill so I'll let him off. A good albom. Wel dun!"
negative,"Wow - Certainly not the Grammy Music we heard from Ma: When buying this CD I expected the same type/style of music I heard when Yo-Yo Ma played the theme from ""The Patriot"" at the Grammys. What I got was definitely not what I expected - somewhere between the vocal cacophony in the first part of ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" and a Berg piece - not quite just noise, but definitely atonal.Amazon needs to refine its recommendation list since this one showed up as something I'd like. I enjoy Yo-Yo Ma as one of the finest cellists performing today, and have heard him live with Emmanuel Ax, and I usually go to a movie that has a John Williams score even if the story doesn't look like something I'd enjoy. Unfortunately, this looks like asparagus and chocolate sauce - I like each individually, but the combination doesn't look appetizing."
positive,Great Play!: My toddler loves his climber. The slides kept his attention the most. It wasn't that difficult to put together once we figured out which way we wanted it facing.
positive,"Misunderstood!: This is the most misunderstood film ever. The fast forwarded sex scenes are not sexy, they're actually comic and the violence in this movie are comic too. I think that was the main problem because some idiots may interpret it as a film that glorifies violence and rape although the whole point of it is too repel it. And the scene where he knocks the waoman down with a giant penis is actualy very funny. What i think bothers people about it is that there's actually a point in the film where you start felling sorry for Alex; YOU actually start felling pity for this monster, this rapist and you don't understand why you feel that way!"
positive,"Pretty good: I'm a coming-of-age genre fan, so Gossip Girl is right up my alley. The season started a little slowly, but it picked up pace toward the end. Mostly it was the same-old, same-old, just with grown-up clothing and with more serious consequences for actions. Still, I recommend it to anyone who has followed the series, because the last half of the season left several dangling threads for season 4. And from the promo, season 4 should pick up right where 3 left off, which I think will be better than the gap between 2 and 3."
negative,"More elevator music...: Two or three good songs, the rest are filler. Reminds me of Silver and Gold and a few other recent releases that some people think are ""Timeless Classics"". Greendale was the only worthwhile project from Neil in the last 10 years. It must have sapped his creative juices.Maye we'll never hear the ""old"" Neil again, a depressing thought, but if he's going to keep churning out Wal Mart background music, I wish he'd change his name so I won't be tempted again.Didn't some great musician once say ""Its better to burn out than to fade away?"" My my, hey hey.My love of Neil Young's music goes back to the early 70's in college and my admiration of him personally will never diminish. But his music has taken a change in direction that I no longer enjoy. Boring, tedious, mind-numbing, sing-song, chose your adjective. For anyone that has enjoyed his last few offerings (Greendale excepted), this one is sure to satisfy."
positive,Hard to trust any other battery: I got an off-brand battery as an extra for my SD800 IS and was disapointed with the life. The Canon brand is worth the extra cost.
negative,"What a let down: Having only read the two Dune novels and having loved the first one so much, I couldn't believe how dull this one was. What a huge let down. Do I even dare reading the third, fourth and fifth. No; I sleep well enough as it is."
positive,"great book for preschool classroom!: I love this book and will use it often in my preschool classroom. The bold pictures and short text work very well and can lead to some great discussions! We need to help kids understand what makes them feel good and that it's okay to have a different ""feel good"" than the kid sitting next to you. It's important for kids to know what feel good means and which things trigger that feeling. Super book!"
negative,"Julie IS Truly Offensive in her writing!Not for those under 18!: I was so excited to read a book by someone whom had accomplished such a tome~Chef Julia Child's co~authored and written for Americans, :Mastering the Art of French Cooking,Volume I.Then, as I began to ""get"" involved in the story line, shocked. Julie could not complete ONE PAGE without Profanity.Why? I have made many ""prat~falls"" in the Kitchen and extreme profanity did not make me feel better!I returned my barely read copy for my money back! I'd rather have Volumes I &II of ""French Cooking"" that cost LESS and are True Poetry.Julie, Yes You made ""skads"" of money and ""happy for ya, yet, honestly, would not want to be ya."" {I did get my copies of both voloumes through my book club.}Also, rely on Amazon and other well established web sites I trust."
positive,"happy with it...but: I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!"
negative,"Editor Please!: The publisher created this book utilizing OCR software. There are multiple typos on every page, in some cases rendering words incomprehensible. This is explained by the publisher as a cost-containment measure. So everyone wins! What a joke. This particular book should never have been published. I wish I had gone elsewhere to read this wonderful play."
positive,Nice having a large set: For the occasional need for a large bolt or nut it's great having this large set. Quality is fine.
positive,Very Comfy Slippers!: I work from home so I use my slippers alot. And this is the only one not to come apart on me after a few months use. Love it!
positive,"Overall fine!: I bought this to replace and older USB wireless adapter which I broke. This one works fine with my series 2 Tivo. Hooked up easily, no problems. Better quality reception!"
negative,"Boring and pointless: I found it difficult to read through, goes into heavy detail on 17th Century German farming culture early on and that was the exciting part."
positive,"A good read, but comes up short of Spenser.: I have been a huge fan of the Spenser books for a long time now and always look foward to the release of a new Robert B. Parker book. This new character is good, but lacks the spark (and wit) of Spenser.Sunny Randall is, however, a much more exciting character than Parker created in his Jesse Stone books. I especially enjoyed the interaction between her ex-husband and her gay friend Spike. They are so different and yet so alike.Despite the short-comings of this book, it is still a wonderful read. Nobody gives rich dialouge like Parker. And it is amazing how much excitement Parker can pack into the 3 page showdown between Sunny and the villian at Tony Marcus' resturant.It's just sad to have your appitite whet with Tony Marcus and Ty-bop and not have Spenser around. Well, I guess we just have to wait another six months ..."
positive,"Review - Chords and Scales for Guitarists: I liked this book. I have played guitar for many years but have only recently tried to learn a bit more about the theory in an attempt to improve my playing. So far I have only read this book (haven't actually played the exercises yet with the CD).The book is not heavy on theory. As the author puts it ""I also want to put accross information in as clear, un-cluttered and jargon-free way that I can."" I think he pretty much suceeds in that goal.The book uses TAB rather than standard notation, so if you can't read standard music notation you can still get something out of this book.It is more than just a book full of scales and is written in an easy to read style. I feel I have picked up a few things (and think I will pick up more once I start playing along with the CD) by reading through this book."
positive,"The Best Video of Yosemite on Blu-ray Disc: This is a grander view of Yosemite like you've never seen it before.Having just watched this, I can truly say that Blu-ray picture qualityjust doesn't get any better than this. Almost every scene is amasterpiece by veteran nature photographer Bob Glusic. Not only are allof the well-known landmarks of Yosemite featured here, but many backcountry areas of exquisite beauty fill this disc. Snow, ice, flowers,wildlife, walking along trails and river banks abound here - but unlikeother national park videos you've seen, you rarely see people. Nolodges, crowded trails, shops, cars - just the wilderness that gives youa feeling of solitude and being one with nature. You can choose tolisten to a narrative description and great music, or just ambientsounds."
positive,Fluke: Especially love the magnet feature which allows the fluke to be hung just about anywhere. The cost was a bit hefty - but I can see myself keeping this for the next 10+ years.
positive,"This cd is a little resume of a brilhiant death/black band.: This cd resumes some important moments in angel corpse's history like great Eps and excellent cover versions for classics... It's just TOO bad this band had not the value they deserve this band was / is the BEST in the death/black genre , it's just the PERFECT mix of slayer-like guitar riffs , fast drumming and great black metal vocals and some MAD guitar solos as well, it's sad to know I'm being the only one so far to be talking about this cd..."
positive,"Top notch: This is a top notch series. It is post apocalyptic lit (dare I use that word?), not strictly zombie horror. Don't get me wrong, the zombies are horrifying, but this is less focused on detailing zombie violence than other series. This is more about characters' reactions to the zombie violence, and less about gore. So if all you want is gore and violence you won't like the parts of the story that advance the overall plot of how mankind reacts and how we survive. But if you want to know the answers to these two questions, keep reading !"
positive,"Intriguing and Invigorating: This was a novel I found by accident when looking for another ""Night,"" but after reading the description, gave it a try. One should definitely give it a try. The prose is very involving. It draws one in and never lets go. So many questions, so many answers. One's imagination becomes a best friend as the narrative process unfolds. It is a treasure trove of literary talent.The reason why it's not five stars as opposed to four is because I still left a bit confused! But it's very enriching and will leave you a happy reader."
positive,"Get a grip people: It is my understanding that this is a work of fiction, based on historical events. As such, it is a wonderful book that left me thinking about the characters and the era for days.It also left me with questions about the historical record such as 'How did the Church of England really form?' and 'Is Mary a historical figure and if so, were two of her children Henry's?' 'What happened to them?' 'How did Elizabeth become Queen?'I will grant you that I am completely ignorant of the subject. However, it is my opinion that this genre should leave you wondering what the truth really is so that you can investigate the history in a non-fiction environment. I fully intend to follow up to learn the facts as they are currently known."
positive,"already useful: my husband is studying for the asvab after a few years, and is finding this book really helpful on what to study. the preview tests are great mind joggers."
negative,"formula type writing: My first foray into this writer was her latest book, Scarpetta. I enjoyed it....so I purchased this effort and several others she had written. I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies. After a while reading her work becomes less than stimulating. It becomes trite."
positive,"We love baby dry!: We are strictly a Pampers family. We used swaddlers until my son grew out of size 2-3s then we went directly to cruisers. We had a few leakage issues with cruisers, when my son would roll to his belly in the middle of the night, but were happy with them in general. A few friends of ours had been using baby dry's and metioned that they loved them (and that they were a little cheaper than cruisers!) so we decided to give them a try. And we LOVE them. We have not had one overnight leak! The only complaint that I have is that the tabs are made a little cheaper than swaddlers & cruisers, and a few of them have ripped right off as I'm fastening the diaper. I've just learned to be a little gentler with them, and we haven't had a problem since. Overall, I give them an A!"
negative,"As good as duct tape: You might as well wax your eyebrows with duct tape - it is cheaper and will produce the same results as this product. This stuff pulls as much skin off as it does hair, so beware."
negative,"Equivalent: I received the product today only to find that it was not what was ordered. I ordered a K&N; Air filter and received an product I am unfamiliar with called DNA Air filter from a company in Greece.I contacted the seller and they were very cooperative in resolving the order. As it turned out, the DNA product was of same or better value so I decided to keep the filter"
negative,"This book is a pack of lies.: Don't waste your money on ""Tour"" it's full of lies & half truths.The Swift Boat vets for truth have proven that the war stories in the book are false.A better purchase would be Unfit For Command - proven to be 100%true by everyone.I'm John F. Kerry & I approve of this message."
negative,"Predictable and Unrealistic: This book was an easy, fast read, but the story line was very melodramatic and predictable. There was no depth to the story. The romance was a little too sappy."
negative,"The Crummy: It's bad. It's really bad. The action's o.k., and the effects are nice, but it's bad. I thought the first mummy was really fun, had a nice story, and was all together a pretty good movie. While watching ""The Mummy 2: The Crummy"", I kept saying to myself ""What the (expletive)?"". The little pigmy monsters, the elaborate sand models the kid made, the balloon, the fake looking CG when mixed with real people, the...everything.The reason I give it two stars instead of zero, is that I liked the way it flushed out the story between the mummy and his woman, expanding on the footage shown at the beginning of the first film. If you really liked the first one, a lot, watch this movie once to get that back story, and then forget about it. Or don't watch it at all, so you can have a fond memory of the first one. Actually, you should go rent the old 1932 version of the mummy. It's great!"
negative,"Cashing in on neo-swing: After listening to 'Zoot Suit Riot' on the radio, I bought this and two other Cherry Poppin Daddies CD's, wanting to support any neo-swing band. Unfortunately, the CPD was nothing like I had hoped for. First of all, 'Zoot Suit Riot' is a great song, but the rest of the album sounds nothing like it. As you go through the album, you can hear how the lead singer changed his voice for ZSR to get that jazzy sound. His real voice, heard in most of the other tracks, is squeaky, and quite annoying, to me. You might be interested to find out that the CPD were originally a ska-type band, but with the lead singer's voice, not a great one. Those who've listened to older swing will be very disappointed with this album, it's like a tourist's version of the music. It sounds like a bunch of guys just trying to sound like a swing band, but they just don't have it. Get the ZSR single instead, and most of all, don't waste your money buying their former albums--it's not neo swing."
positive,"gore classic: Yup, this 1974 independent horror flick set the basis for most horror films to follow: A group of teens is victimized and butchered by a monster/psycopath/etc... the only person who survives is a girl.The heroine of the tale.This movie is remains very creepy and gross after 30 years of its production. The dvd has very good image and cool special features.the guy they picked up in the van is surely scary enough to make not want to go drive in rural Texas. leatherface likes to wear girl's faces, how weird and twisted is that? and good ole grandpa in his wheel chair... what the hell is he? some kind of living dead person? this movie is so realistic it gives me the creeps!"
positive,"closure: This an absolutely wonderful book. The author is my niece and I have spent many visits with Natanial who is a remarkable and well adjusted child. I am the "" Aunt E.J. "" in this book and am now in my 70's so I have had a long time to deal with my ""handicap"". This book brings a lot of closure and insight into many parts of my life. I would recommend this exquisite book to all ages."
negative,"Leave out the swearing please!: This book would have been ten times better (and half as long) if she had stuck to her cooking experiences. I could completely do without her foul mouth and her completely unrelated rantings about politics and sex. This book had great potential, but doesn't deliver. I fervently hope the movie version takes out the garbage and only keeps the good stuff."
negative,professors and consultants love this book but it's not real: I work on at a large investment bank in NY in the M&A department. I have yet to see any of the McKinsey consultants' formulas in practice. I like the Jeffrey Hooke book on valuation or the Josh Rosenbaum book on LBOs and value. Good luck on finding deals.
positive,"Possibly the Best out of this series!: It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!"
positive,great product: people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential..A must have for any headset that will fit them
positive,"quarter through, and totally imressed: I have yet to complete this book, but its great so far. Entertaining, and educational. hard to mix the two and keep my interests. I hope this helps sway you to purchase. HAPPY SHOPPING"
negative,"Very Dissapointing: If you're interested in only buying this to listen to the interviews and comments of artists who were there, and finally getting to hear from Rosenman and Roberts, then by all means buy the DVD. But if you're buying it for the musical content you'll be very dissapointed. They edited a lot of the songs horribly and cut the life out of them."
positive,"feel good music: This CD is typical of what your would expect from Idle Cure, good, old fashioned rock 'n' roll with Christian tones and themes. The music is inspirational and makes you feel good as you listen to it. I think any Christian rock fan would enjoy this. Idle Cure has a unigue sound that sets them apart from other bands. Give it a listen- you will like it."
positive,"Excellent: An excellent book with broad appeal that seeks to disprove the myth of the ""empty Americas"" that has been taught to the average American for so long. The book isn't a scholarly work, but is very accessible and enjoyable for laymen and amateurs with an interest in pre-Columbian America. The pages of source material in the appendix should provide excellent direction for those wishing to delve even deeper into the science behind the book."
negative,"Where are the children?!: I bought this game 3 days ago. I have to admit that it's addictive and amusing.. but when I found out that you're not able to have children, I freaked. Creating and raising families was the main reason I bought this game.The PC version is absolutly incredible, but since my computer does not meet the system requirements, I can only play it when I visit my friend.Really, I have no intention of playing the console version anymore, I'm ready to take it back. I'm completely dissatisfied."
positive,"Absolutely necessary: Not much to say except that the product does exactly what it is supposed to do; the real value is in what it saves you from doing. Having to attach and detach my router's fixed base to the router table each time I wanted to use it was enough of a pain that I sometimes decided against doing certain projects. Now that I have the Bosch RA1165 permanently attached under my wonderful Bosch RA1181 router table, I jump easily and immediately between fixed base and router table use. The Bosch RA1165 looks to me to be exactly the same as the fixed base for the Bosch 1617EVSPK router, without the wooden handles (though there are holes to attach handles), so it works precisely the same as the base I was used to.If you ever use your router off the table, this product is absolutely necessary. Very much worth the low price."
positive,"Great film, with slight apologies to history: Gladiator is a great film, a must for anyone's library if they call themselves a student of film, history and/or entertainment in general.The film is a beautiful representation of the Rome of our dreams and a brief period, the age of Commodus, within that grand vista. The film did take several liberties from the truth:1-Commodus was not a scheming adult but a bit of a lad when he became emperor; there is no evidence he did or could eliminate his father.2-The man that killed Commodus was not an erudite military general but instead a crude brute wrestler, hired by conspirators to do the job.3-His sister was not a victim of Commodus; indeed, she conspired to have him killed; he caught her 1st and had her exiled from Rome.4-Far from being treacherous, Commodus was a relative ""babe in the woods"" who was assailed by conspiratorial senators who ""missed"" several times until that ""wrestler"" ended his reign, in a hot tub of all places."
negative,"Surprisingly not that good: OK, I am not a musicologist etc. but am a long time fan of both Desmond and Mulligan so I was all set to love this album, but I didn't. Mulligan's playing seemed lifeless and Desmond's lyricism was not in evidence. This is probably unfair but they both seemed to just be going through the motions"
positive,"Not perfect...but damn good!!!!: I really enjoy this DVD..The Brothers play with fire and emotion. Yes there are Interview interuptions(that I could live without...but not as bad as people make you think..most of the songs are not interupted)...but it still serves it's purpose well...like making you want to get up and boogie and play air Guitar with Dickie and Warren. The Whole band was on key...Gregg sounds great.I love this Band...the New and the Old. God Bless Duane, Berry,Lamar and Allen....we miss you guys."
negative,"Emma - Noteable for dubious reasons: There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered. It was written by a woman. If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit. The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's ""Frankenstein"", Kate Chopin's ""The Awakening"", Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple"", ""Nectar in a Seive"" by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" by Zora Neale Hurston. All of these works have better characteristics than ""Emma"", and prove to be superior to all of Austen's writings.Trust me, ""Emma"" is a waste."
negative,Bird Feeder: This is one of the worst bird feeders I've ever bought. It allows the birds to waste seed and the top doesn't stay seated.
negative,"Good tea/cheap chest: The tea assortment in the chest is excellent, vey tasty. However, the chest is very poorly put together. The applique material does not line up and there are numerous rough edges. Not wht I would want to display on the countertop."
positive,"Amazing collector's edition: Here we have -again- an exquisite product, as all made about Enya, again luxuriously finished, again a detailed item. The red velver case with gold stamped logos and titles is just precious. And the contents, the 148 page book, deliciously written by Roma Ryan is the big surprise of this collector's edition, full of pictures and of course including the CD and the lyrics of each song, both english and in the ""loxian"" language created by Roma where available.For Enya and not Enya fans, just get this one if you want to know more about the creating process of the album Amarantine."
positive,"Great Songs!: Funny Girl is an old fashioned musical telling an old fashioned story. The real life star was Fanny Brice, played by Barbra Streisand. The songs are fantastic ( especially My Man and Don?t Rain on my Parade) and the costumes are full of life and color. Omar Shariff is dashing as Nick Arnstein, the gambler husband. Walter Pidgeon is good as Folrenz Ziegfeld. Anne Francis has a small part as Fanny?s showgirl friend. Personally, I would have wanted her role to be a little larger."
negative,SAD!: i thought this was a great book because i've never read the origanal but it was about 700 pages shorter DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
negative,"Too much cut out!: Remember when you went to see this movie in the theater? It was almost three hours long, if my memory serves me. When you buy the DVD you would assume, unless told otherwise, that you are getting AT LEAST as much material as the film version. But not so with this movie! I was very disappointed to find that they had cut material throughout this movie to bring the viewing time under 2 hours. This was painfully obvious to me from the very first scene to the last, and I only saw the movie once in the theater; I can't imagine what a disappointment this is going to be to the REAL fans who may have seen it numerous times. I say save your money until they come out with the FULL movie... which I think they eventually will, after this sham of a version has gotten all the money out of the marketplace that it can. I feel so cheated with this DVD that I am compelled to write my first review, and I hope it helps you avoid wasting your money like I did."
negative,"Disappointed: What a shame that these are considered to be"" acclaimed films""..while the color,design,etc was fine-I was. Surprised that these fine actors would choose to act in such features.To be honest,I must admit. That I was unable to bring myself to finish viewing them all,it went from bad to worse"
positive,"if it was a prediction...: If this book represents Orwell's circa 1948 prediction of 1984, he wasn't exactly right, but he wasn't completely wrong either. Some have argued that we now live in a pseudofascist state in the modern United States, in large part thanks to another George. I'm sure Orwell's book was profoundly influenced by the historical context of his own life, especially WWII. It's certainly a very well written book, with vivid imagery and several memorable scenes. The movie version with John Hurt is also very well orchestrated. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."
positive,"Excellent: At last a fitness book for women that delivers on its promises. The book is clear and concise. It reads very easily and covers all aspects of exercise. As an advanced exerciser, it has taken me to a new level of training."
positive,"A book that will live for ever!: I re-read the river between for literature and I was just touched like I was at the very first time. The quality anthropology aspects that Mr wa Thiong'o builts in his books (like many other African writers too) makes the reader come into the setting and be part of it. The book managed to win my sympathy for the 'oppresed' Kikukyu and reminded me of the many evils done to the colonised people all over the world. Christianity seems not able to escape blame in the whole operation because of its readiness to inflict suffering to the people so that they could join the religion.Today the book is still relevant, though the position of the whites has been taken by the ruling class and the rich.The book is worth reading in any case."
positive,"classic western storyline with unusual features: This is a riveting film with good acting and, although there is nothing original in the basic storyine, there are some unusual and interesting features. It is good to see a western which upholds traditional values instead of celebrating meanness and selfishness as so many modern films have done and still do (although it's getting better!).This film reminds me of Kevin Costner's ""Free Range"" - if this DVD film had been on the large screen, with some tighter direction, it might have merited classic status."
positive,"One of the Best books I have read. Could not put it down.: I read this book about 5 years ago, lost it and have been trying to find it for about 5 years. It is one of the best books that I have read. I could not put it down. I have had some sea adventures myself but nothing like this. I have recomended it to all my marine friends but have not been able to locate it until today."
negative,"Mediocre at Best: I purchased this cd on someone's fervent recommendation, and am pretty disappointed in the very limited scope of this artist's work, as well as in the over-use of sampling. The piano flourishes are in no way clever or interesting. This is merely ho-hum dance hall stuff without any real depth. You want enlightenment? Check out ANYTHING by Orbital; they understand and employ technology and polyphony better than just about any group. Also, Moby's proselytizing in the liner notes are just so annoying!"
positive,"This CD is the best big band, swing album you could buy!: This greatest hit album of the Cherry Poppon' Daddies is a CD for everyone. It has a wide varity of fast, slow, happy, and hardcore songs. I think that anyone who is just getting into ska,jazz,swing, ect. should get the amazing CD"
positive,"Best calculus book, but not for beginners.: This is the best book on calculus that I have ever seen. However, it can never be used as a text for first year calculus students because they lack the mathematical sophistication to understand most of the material in this book. The book is not about the HOW TO, but instead it's about the WHY. There are lots of proofs and some interesting examples. This would be a good alternative book for Advanced Calculus.I read certain parts of this book when I have to teach a complicated topic to my calculus students (e.g. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Taylor Series) and then I streamline the material so that they can understand it.My main complaint is the absurd price! Try to find a cheaper used copy. It's outrageous that a book this important is so expensive."
positive,"One More Comment: I have already rated and reviewed this album...........the best one of 2003!! But I have one more comment to make to the person that said great singers are only those who write their own music and lyrics. Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley............shall I go on?! They didn't write hardly any of their music. They had people write for them. Why? Because they were the greatest interpators of a song and song writers lined up to have them sing their songs. Clay is the next one in line!! And whose to say he may not write some of his songs in the future?! Some of you people need to understand what music is all about. Just like a book or a movie its all about what we enjoy on an individual basis. If its not your taste in music you don't need to write a scathing review, just say its not your cup of tea and keep your biased opinions to yourself."
negative,"Stock Footage!?: This movie is bad because of two reasons: the use of stock footage of the battle of Midway instead of recreating the events and all the actors are speaking English instead of their native languages. The reason that ""The Longest Day,"" ""Patton,"" ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and ""A Bridge Too Far"" are better is because they only use stock footage when showing a WWII newsreel. All the battles are recreated. The latter reason is also a similar connection to the forementioned movies. Anybody who has seen the Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune in his Kurosawa masterpieces knows his gruf, hard voice. He doesn't sound like that at all when he speaks English, he instead sounds like a Japanese man trying to speak English. These two problems ruin all the credibility of the movie. The extra star is to showing the movie in its orignial Panavision."
negative,"Super Mario Bros The Movie: Hello People, I am going to be reviewing a Movie that ruined my school reputation.... The Movie itself is OK....These famous actors who are chosen to play mario and luigi are acting in this movie, OK.. So I was in first grade when I watched this on VHS, and then my best friend Louis who was sitting next to me at story time was talking to me and then this picture from the movie came in to my mind and I told him ""Let's be bad!"" From that day in first grade I would always go to the pricipals office and never complete assignments. That is why I would NOT recommend this movie for anyone under the age of 10, if you are 10, please have an adult with you so you don't get any ideas.Huge Mario Bros fan that is above 10... OK you can watch it, if you are age 9 or below please steer clear of this title.Please get this movie if you are above the age of ten!J.R. Platt"
negative,"Only a music producer can like this.: Listening to this synthesized 21st Century adaptation of a great classic could turn a classical enthusiast into a classical hater. After listening to this anemic attempt at capturing the power of a acclaimed musical portrait by using synthesized instruments, one is left to wonder why a recording company hasn't recorded this piece using a large orchestra. It just begs for the real thing. At least with a large orchestra there might be more justification to charge $23 for just 33 minutes of music. I would strongly urge classical music lovers to approach with caution if they are thinking of buying any of the other selections in this classical music series played by Alexander Jero. Too bad Amazon doesn't offer a money-back guarantee on opened CDs. As for the sound, it is enveloping, if you like to be surrounded by harsh virtual instrumentation."
negative,"Hannigan Deserves So Much Better: I'm giving this DVD an extra star only because of the presence of Alyson Hannigan, who is so effortlessly charismatic, funny, and lovely that she almost makes it worth sitting through. Otherwise, this is a movie that suffers from ""Family Guy"" disease; the writers think that a random reference to another movie or TV show is the same thing as a joke. So they have an actress re-enact the Paris Hilton hamburger commerical; or stick Hannigan in Uma Thurman's yellow ""Kill Bill"" track suit and give her a sword to wave around. And then they don't try to be clever or put a funny spin on these; they just hope the 13-year-old boys in the audience will recognize the reference and think that's enough. One hopes that better filmmakers will see Hannigan's star power and put her in funnier movies, so we can all just forget about this one."
negative,"Nobody can play Lecuona like Lecuona: To my knowledge, no other pianist, Cuban or otherwise, has tried to do a remake of Lecuona's own piano solo recordings. I can't blame them, for with incredibly large hands applied to playing his own compositions, Lecuona had an unmatched advantage.Frank Emilio Flynn's effort was noble, and he earns an E for effort, but get the original Lecuona recordings from the 1950's and hear those. One good thing that Emilio's recording does is to keep alive the piano music that was written and performed by Cuba's best classical composer of mid 20th century, forgotten even by classical pianists today, Ernesto Lecuona."
positive,"Excellent Book: This was a Kindle download, amazingly fast. The book itself is a classic with many memorable and useful points for anyone searching for answers about Christianity."
negative,"disappointed: This product did not last two months. I brought it for emergencies and when I needed it, it wasn't working."
negative,"About Justin Martyr, Not By Him: I ordered this and was disappointed to find that it was like Cliff's Notes. It's virtually useless unless you already have a copy of Justin's writings (and who does?). I suppose for six bucks I shouldn't complain.Would it really have killed them to provide some extra pages of his writings, in keeping with the ambiguous title? Say, twenty or thirty pages. It's not like they're copyrighted by the author's estate. Heck, I can probably grab an English translation of Justin off the web for free. Hey wait a minute, why didn't I think of that before buying this thing?"
negative,Caused engine light to go on: Installed this cap on my 2006 Saab 95 Turbo and engine light went on within 10 minutes. Removed and put the OEM cap back on and light went out.
negative,"At Least It's Over Quickly: I'd call this book a waste of time, but since it only takes a couple of hours to read, that description is inaccurate. Nontheless, I can say it contains nothing of value. Any critics likening Chris Bachelder to Vonnegut need to re-read Cat's Cradle or Slaughterhouse Five, then publish a retraction."
positive,"Get white teeth for a decent price.: LOVE. Get that Cali girl bright white smile. Results are fantastic. Warning: If you have sensitive teeth you may hate this product. I never noticed sensitivity before this, but did in the hours after using a strip. The directions indicate that if you experience sensitivity you should not use twice a day and maybe use something like once every couple days. This really helps. Also, I brush with Sensodyne PRONAMEL during the couple weeks I am using the whitening strips. These two tips eliminated any sensitivity and I still had great results. It was at least a year before I noticed a less white smile, and then I just bought a new pack."
positive,"flawless victory: ''Mortal Kombat'' will never be a karate epic, but it's a great movie considering it was based on a video game. The special effects are fantastic."
positive,"I'll try to keep it short: Ok, here it is in a nutshell, this is almost like a watching a Batman documentary, no over the top villians, no goofy sidekicks, just the complete origin of Batman. Very good acting and well paced, this movie is the polar opposite of Batman & Robyn."
negative,"A disappointment!: I was disappointed with this product. It does not heat up like it says it does, and the ""massage"" was just an annoying vibration. I meant to send it back, but never got to the post office. It is still sitting in the box to return in my laundry room. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it now."
negative,"Destroyed the Paint on my Spoiler Fin: I followed the instructions to the letter, mounted the rack, put the bike on it, motored around, used the bike, put it back on, got home, took the bike off and discovered the coarse fabric and hardware rubbed the paint off my spoiler fin in two places. There were scratches where the hooks go in to the side of the trunk. The only way I could get the sides taut was to have the hooks in contact with the edges of the spoiler fin.If I were a new car owner, I'd be all lawsuity and Consumer Reportsy. But, my car is 9 years old and I touch park, so I just feel I need to opine here as a Cautionary Tale.If you have a new car, don't use this. Get something that mounts off your trailer hitch. The only reason I got this was that it was the only trunk mount rack available for my car. My car does not have a trailer hitch. I cannot use a roof mount because I cannot lift a bike over my head.In a nutshell. OK for a beater. Not OK for a new car."
positive,"The Best Book I've Ever Read: This book is amazing. I've never read a book this long that has kept my attention every minute throughout the entire book. No matter what kind of literature you prefer, you can't go wrong with this book. It's what I call an everything book, meaning it has a little bit of everything in it: adventure, romance, mystery, humor, etc. The way the characters develop is very interesting and the way that each chapter leads so well into the next just makes you want keep the book in your hands at all times. Whatever you do, don't read an abridged version. I don't see how anyone could take even one chapter out of this book. Highly recommended to everyone, no matter what type of literature you're most interested in."
negative,"I will NOT FALL: I love this film, and I just recently picked up a PS3 to enjoy BLURAY movies and such. However due to the quality of (wink wink) digitally remastered transfers only HALF of the SMALL amount of films I want to watch on BR are worth seeing, this is NOT one of them sadly. This looks no better than the last DVD release. Ive seen MUCH older and cheaper made movies come out looking better on BR....me sad"
negative,"Coffeeless in Syracuse: As so many other people have found our Platinum $150.00 brewer does exactly the same thing, it shuts itself off for no reason. This is our second brewer the first one was sent back as it was defective also. This time I cannot get ahold of customer service and they take at least a week to answer any emails. I SUBMITTED A REVIEW ON THEIR SITE AND THEY DIDN'T POST IT. It seems they only post reviews of 4 stars or better. Keurig is horrible do not buy their produts."
positive,Great Service: Great customer service and shipping was quick product in great condition. Love the movie. thanks.
negative,"Satire? That Quickly Grows Tiresome: Sort of an odd stew satirizing porn novels and English political extremists featuring an antihero skinhead as the catalyst for many things. Loads of over-the-top sex, violence and ideological debate make for a somewhat tiresome book. Not likely to appeal to many people."
positive,Valuation (McKinsey - 4th Edition): This book is awesome. It offers incredibly comprehensive and insightful methods for rearranging financial statements into key drivers of firm value. It also teaches you how to apply those drivers to create a forecast for the future. Individual chapters are dedicated to the more complex concepts. This is a great resource for an aspiring or practicing analyst.
positive,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very nice story. I think my Wife bought it for our Grand Daughter because she and our Daughter both loved it.
negative,"Ugggg!: My wife said it best ""this movie is for teen age boys"". Sure there's lots of action and stuff blowing up all over the place. Some great effects, although a bit far fetched in the reality department. But the acting... yikes. Diesel takes the 'wood' grammy away from Keanu. They should have given him a role like AAAH-NOLD in Terminator... very few lines. And the female lead...I guess shes good if you're into ""heroin"" chic.Puullllease! I guess some people liked it though...possibly the same people who think pro wrestling is a sport!"
positive,Excellent reference guide: I work at a Wild Birds Unlimited store and customers rely on you to give them the best information on bird feeding and care available. This book is super helpful in achieving that goal.
negative,"Dean Koontz's Frankenstein: I imagine this is a very creative book written by Dean Koontz, and I loved his Odd books. This book is just too dark for me, too brutal, too mean. I wanted to keep going, but there is no point in forcing my psyche to undergo things that make me too uncomfortable. Although it isn't for me, if you don't mind pretty dark books, you might like it."
positive,"An Excellent Camera: I purchased a Minolta HTsi Plus camera in October 2000 and have shot an average of two rolls of film per week with this camera since then. I have nothing but praise for this camera. The HTsi Plus has never failed me in any way. I suggest you buy the body only. Don't spend money on a 28-80 lens that may come in some camera kits; rather put that money into a lens that gives you much more flexibility, like a 28-200 lens. I use Sigma 28-200 and 70-300 auto focus lenses, and I can report nothing but satisfaction, reliability, and ease of use. I had considered purchasing a more expensive SLR camera, but today I am pleased I did not, for this camera is perfect for me, an experienced but amateur photographer. I have had loads of fun with this camera and taken hundreds of wonderful photos. I recommend the Minolta HTsi Plus without hesitation or qualification."
negative,"American idle is more like it...: Clay Aiken has to be one of the worst singers ever to come off of American Idol. The songs on his debut CD are all predictible and sleep-inducing. Even William Hung is capable of making a better CD than this drab garbage. With boring singles like ""Invisible"" and ""The Way,"" I can't understand how Americans could make this guy a star. Please, Clay, if you insist on making more music, at least have the decency of doing a nice gay anthem like ""I Will Survive"" or ""YMCA."""
negative,"Little practical advice: When you are thinking about starting your own business, probably the last thing you need is this sort of fluffy advice to become ""mature"", wear a suit, and heavily network. I was hoping for more solid information, like the virtues of incorporating rather than being a sole proprietor and other real concerns of a small business person. Plus the author's ""voice"" really irritated me. There are *much* better books out there on this subject."
negative,"Rosemarys Boring: This movie was not as good as it seems. When i first rented it, I thought it was going to be pretty good considering I like classic horror films. But to my belief, it was very boring. The begining was pretty interesting with the couple looking for an appartment to rent, and the dead body in the begining/middle. But after a while it was very bland. Especially the part where she gets pregnant. I actually laughed during one part where she was ""floating on a bed in the middle of the ocean"". I rated it one star only because of the connections the movie made at the end with all of its characters. There was only one exciting part where i was saying to myself, ""finally"" but then it ended very quickly. I thought her decision was ludacris at the end. Don't waist two hours like i did watching this film."
negative,"INCREDIBLY WEAK!!!: I could bet a lot, that all those 5-star ratings to this album are written by (you-know-who) staff!This album is really weak, believe me. It's incredibly weak! The melodies are in a weird arabic (wrong orientation nowadays, after 9.11) style, the lyrics are utterly meaningless, solos are non-existant, guitar melodies are really primitive and the singer has one of the worst voices I have ever heard with this stupid accent, that he purposely stresses in every song. Besides that, all the songs are prolonged as possible, just to cover those poor 40+ mins of the album with one of the worst cases of hardcore.It's NOT worth a buy, really! The whole album leaves a sense of a group that have hurried their release, just to scrapp of some money on it."
negative,"Not What I Expected: I expect that a book with a subtitle of ""An Investigative Approach"" would teach concepts through discovery learning. That is the trend for learning/teaching nowadays. In fact, this book teaches math concepts like every other math book, it just has little activities to reinforce the concepts. I wasn't that impressed by the activities, either.What I want and can't find is a math book of discovery learning activities that help students uncover the ideas by connecting previous knowledge in a new way. I also want a book that provides meaningful, real-world applications to the concepts learned. This book isn't it."
negative,"Disappointed: I received the dishes to find that although they are the same style & design as my collection, they are lighter in color and lighter in weight, slightly smaller dinner plate and manufactured in a different country than my orignal 8 pc set that I purchased locally. I received the dishes with two broken cups and one broken dinner plate. I was truely disappointed, but decided not to return them as I felt I would just receive a similar product. I will ask more questions the next time I order additional pc for my set."
negative,HORRIBLE: This product shouldnt even deserve one star. A soon as I installed it it cracked the next day and started leaking bad. A few days later the water pressure was really BAD. To top it all off the freakin handle is huge. Even for somebody with big hands it wouldnt feel comfortable.
positive,overall this is among the best whitening products I've tried: I have used these for a while and I have seen results with them. They are easy to apply and usually stay on for the full time once they are applied. If the strips start to fall off (and that is rare) I just press them firmly back into place with a cotton swab and that usually does the job. I did take off one star because at times they can be somewhat painful because of the added pressure. Overall the Crest Strips are among the best whitening products I have used.
negative,"If only I could give it zero stars!: This is the worst book I have ever read. It was extremely dull and violent at the same time. I usually read a book this length in three days, but it took me TWO MONTHS to read this book. I only read it because I had to for school, and I would not read this book again for anything. It was pointless and confusing. I don't care if it was figurative language or not, it was a really below average piece of work. Ugh."
negative,easy and fun for 3-4yr olds: fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing. I've reinstalled it and done everything I know to do to correct the issue. It's a shame my 4yr old really likes it.
positive,"HAPPY FATHER.: PARA EL PRIMER CUMPLEAÑOS DE MI HIJO, LE COMPRE EL MEGALAND. EN CUANTO LO INSTALE EN SU CUARTO (ES FACIL ARMARLO), MI HIJO ENTRO GATEANDO Y SE PUSO A JUGAR CON LAS PELOTAS. CASI NO LO PODEMOS SACAR PARA DORMIRLO. AHORA LE GUSTA JUGAR MUCHO CON LOS PRIMOS Y AMIGOS. LAS PELOTAS QUE TRAE (50) SON INSUFICIENTES, LE COMPRE 150 ADICIONALMENTE. ESTAMOS PENSANDO EN COMPRARLE LOS ADICIONALES PARA AMPLIARLO."
negative,"Not impressed so far: First up, it's not as big as I expected and iv not had it long but it doesn't seem too durable, the slide in's are a little too short to hold an average pen and subsequently the Velcro flap doesnt close too well over the top.It may prove its worth but I think I'm going to end up getting something a little bigger and can hold a few pens trauma sheers alcowipes, pen light l, maybe a few meds etc.Bottom line: this will do the job but only just"
negative,"Bad Printing Choices: I am not commenting on Jules Verne's writing, but rather the format of this particular edition. From the outside, this edition is very nice; as other reviewers have noted, it's great to have the map on the front cover. However, the print inside the book is VERY small. I'm not sure what the publisher was thinking; I've never seen a published book with type this tiny before. The pages are also larger than the average paperback, and the combination of big pages and tiny type gives me an instant headache. Avoid eye strain and buy another edition."
positive,"Kyle ""the yellow dart"" Smith's review: A BRILLIANT READ!!!! Easily the most exceptional book on religion, power, and politics in Colonial St. Augustine from the Florida Museum of Natural History. I found it gripping from front page to last. The way St. Augustine came alive, it was like i was really there. This is a must buy for anyone who finds American history thrilling. Genius! Robert L. Kapitzke is one of the most well versed authors of our time."
negative,"These don't work with Jabra BT250v headsets: I'm not sure what they *do* work with exactly (and it'd be nice if there was some clue in the product description), but they don't fit these headsets.EDITED TO ADD: Actually, I just discovered a ""wireful"" non-Bluetooth Jabra thing that I had purchased years ago and forgotten. It plugs into a phone's headset jack, and these earpieces fit that fine."
positive,"I'm sending a copy of this book to everybody I know: And if you're not on my list, be well advised that this may be the most important book you will ever read."
positive,"For all those who are in doubt: Anyone who glances upon this text has read or is about to read Great Expectations. I have read this book and I can not express to you its true greatness, for I can relate Pip's experiences to my own life and in some amusing way found myself in him. To all the readers who are about to embark on this story, I tell you no matter what I say or any one else says on this page you have to experience this timeless masterpiece for yourself. by Joseph Dion"
negative,"Should have been exciting, ended up boring: I found the book to be incredibly exciting and I assumed that all that entertainment would translate easily to film. I guess not!It wasn't until I tried to watch the movie on DVD after seeing it the theaters opening night that I realized how very boring the movie is. I have been unable to watch it all the way through a 2nd time."
positive,"Sharpe struggles to save his regiment!: One of the things that I enjoy about Cornwell's Sharpe novels is the real picture the reader gets of the life and times of the common soldier. In this book, Sharpe is forced to return to England to find out why his army is not receiving new troops to replace the ones who have been lost to French lead. His quest forces both he and Patrick Harper to go undercover as new recruits in order to expose former Col. Henry Simmerson. The reader gets a real feel of how a soldier was recruited and trained during this time period in England. The book also brings in the Prince of Wales whose addoration of Sharpe earns the regiment the new name of the Prince of Wales Own! I just can't get enough of Richard Sharpe!"
positive,"Prehistoric Research Fiction?: I can't say enough about this book. It is about two prehistoric stages of man (one is on its way out, one is on its way in). The lesser developed man (""the clan"") finds a little girl from the more modern man whose parents have been killed in an earthquake. They take her into the clan and raise her as their own.The story itself is interesting and urges you to read on. But it's the research that's fabulous. I learned more about prehistoric times reading this entertaining work of fiction than I did studying it in high school and college. This is an excellent example of making good use of research.I highly recommend this book to prehistoric history buffs and anyone who simply loves to read good fiction."
negative,Average at best: Was expecting much better quality. A slightly stale taste with a minimum amount of sprayed on salt. Very disappointed with the nuts. If it wasn't such a hassle I would try for a refund.
negative,"Too hard to read.: I returned it. The print is too hard to see, the cover is too thin, and I didn't like the paper it was printed on."
positive,"Savini know's how to do a Romero remake with style: Usually remakes are terrible, but not in this case. Savini had Romero on board as a producer and really did not deviate from the original NOTLD. He found a way to mordernize the film and stay true to it's integrity. He did change things a little mostly the ending but did it a way that left Romaro fans very happy. Savini's respect for George Romero is seen in this remake. Weather it is Martin or Dawn of the dead the Savini/Romero team really shine. The movie opens much like the original and stay's remotely close to the original movie for most of the film. Of course Savini throws in his own changes and the final plot twist is different from the original NOTLD. Savini show's promise as a horror movie director here and as always the special affects are great for the era."
positive,"the dharma rings twice: The devotion to detail, the honesty, the dignity, the humanity, the willingness to put a personal philosophy to the test-all these qualities come up roses in this book.On both levels, the level of person and the level of writer, the author seized the authentic moment of his reality and recognized the power that flows from his being able to totally accept and acknowledge himself, where he's at, and once able to do that with surprise, openness, a lack of bitterness, and an absorption in the moment, he's on your way."
positive,"Classic Mystery: This story will keep you guessing what's to happen next until you see who the villain is. Then you won't be able to wait to see how revenge is dished out. A best classic in every sense of the word. Great acting, actors and photography!"
negative,"Mess: Agree with other reviews - the disc is a mess and no better than DVD - in fact with DNR and EE on blue ray - the processing shows up even more!A disasterWhat were they thinking?Paramount, please do this right and remaster the movie for true 1080P - no processing is fine; film grain is fine - just give us all of the detailDo not buy!"
positive,"Great stuff.: They did a great job with this audiobook. Dune Messiah is my favorite of the Dune Books. I found myself getting all choked up at the end, even though i knew what was going to happen. That tells you a lot. I hope Children of Dune is not too far off in the future. They really do need to get all of the original Frank Herbert material on cd."
negative,Do Not Waste Money On The Blu-ray version: I like this movie and my daughter loves it. We were excited about the blu-ray. We have had the DVD version for years. The blu-ray arrived and if you already have the DVD.....please save your money. The image and sound on the blu-ray are no improvement. In fact in many places the image is inferior....far inferior. The DVD has bright colors and has an fun feel to it. The remastered BR is dark and the colors are dead. The image blurs considerably on fast moving scenes. It is the worst BR I have seen since Wedding Singer.
negative,"The dangers of copy protected CDs!: Not only is this a mediocre Santana CD (Carlos with a bunch of trendy guests for big sales!), it is loaded with copy protection software. I gritted my teeth when I learned that I could NOT rip this CD directly into iTunes for my iPod. Copy protection limits and lessens the conumer experience; a huge backlash has already started, causing CD sales to slide even further. Why doesn't Sony/BMG get it? Copy protected CDs are terrible and you must avoid this CD!"
negative,"Mechanical and lacking subtlety: After listening and falling in love with recordings by Richter, I went back and re-listened to Barenboim's version...I couldn't recognize the piece. None of the phrasing and feeling. The beauty and feeling was completely stripped away, leaving only the notes..."
positive,"Funny: Funny movie. Christine Taylor kissing that girl was sweet. Christine Taylor, Scarlett Chorvat, Julie Gonzalo, and Missi Pyle are hot."
negative,"Horrible and unreadable: Written in old style English.Authentic in that extent but unreadable and almost frustrating to complete.If you have a knack for not giving up halfway and you don't ever wish to break that trend, don't be tempted by this book.Skip it."
negative,Irish movie: The lead actress does a poor job of acting.Was recently in Ireland and stopped at the location of this film.
positive,"Affordable: I wasn't sure this was spec'd for my G3 IBook, but another review and some looking into the hertz/watts thing convinced me. I'm hoping it'll be a backup for my G4 Powerbook too. It works fine. Seems to load up my battery as quickly as the original AC adapter; it's lighter and seems to be more compactable -- easier to carry around. I'd recommend it."
negative,"Way Out Of Date - Better Reference Available: With all of the program changes, this book is very out of date. You can get a lot of the same information for free at http://www.certificationguide.com"
positive,"perfect cooker: I tried Panasonic, Tiger and of course, microwave cooker too, this one is like a Ferrari of cookers, I set the timer to have oatmeal in the morning and perfect rice (white, brown, pink and black) in the evening, life is too short, just get it and enjoy."
negative,"Way off!: It is sad that this series destroyed the story of Superman.Superman did not come to earth to ""learn"" how to use his super powers. Let me explain: We were born on earth and our bodies have adjusted to the gravity. In fact generation after generation of humans have evolved or adapted to all of the earth's elements. Now imagine you travel to another planet and their atmosphere and gravity are lighter, having been used to heavier gravity you would now be able to fly. And bullets that would destroy and kill the people of that planet would just bounce off you. That is why Kryptonite does not kill Superman, it would be equal to someone from that other planet giving you a rock or piece of earth, it would make you ""normal"" or weak.Of course none of this is reality, it is just science fiction fun, but it is the truth behind Superman's powers, not this Smallville nonsense!Let's get the facts straight. Quit ruining the story for future generations!"
positive,Very Good Product: This dictionary is so easy to use and was simple to load onto my computer for quick access and day to day use. I would recommend it to anyone.
positive,"Looks Fine: Theres no grain visible in the blu-ray version, but who cares, grain makes HD look like low quality SD. I want a sharp wow factor, not technically accurate film reproduction (in terms of grain, color and blacks = more important). Watched this on: Pioneer BDP-51FD Blu-ray player > Pioneer Elite SC-07 Receiver > Pioneer Kuro PDP-6020FD. This looks great unless you want grain, you cant notice any enhanced edges or smudging. Wish I hadnt read all the reviews since it made me look for it during the movie. Extended version of the movie is not worth watching, far too long and adds nothing interesting, mostly dialog with the emperor. One scene of more arrows compared to theatrical."
negative,"highly over-rated but intriguing short novel: Though Camus is an exceptional prose stylist he is no thinker and this is never more clear than in The Stranger. Walter Kaufmann has noted the general vacuity of Camus' thought in his (Kaufmann's) prolific criticism on existentialism. Philip Freund, in his meticulously long essay ""Albert Camus and Symbolism"" (in The Art of Reading the Novel) has convincingly demonstrated the alarmingly weak structural integrity of much of Camus' fictional work. I recommend The Stranger as an experiment, as it incidentally yields some intriguing insights; but I qualify this recommendation as, architectonically (inclusive of plot execution, coherence of symbolism, philosophical cogency) The Stranger, largely, is a failure."
positive,I don't know: I don't know want the book is about yet Hahaha so can I read now? Thank you ? This is I don't know
positive,"Lost City of Gold is truly ""PURE"": I was hooked at the very first entrance of Sharon Stone. I thought this movie lived up to its sequel. Not many sequels can do that. Special Effects were alright but at the time it was made, it was brillant."
positive,"solid value: I might not want to nap on it myself, but my 2 year old loves it. Good quality and a fair price."
positive,"Not bad at all...: I was not really sure how this movie was going to play, but it is a thriller and it did keep me on the edge of my seat --- I would probably even watch it a second time --- that's saying a lot for me.BUT, do yourself a favor and buy it used on amazon marketplace or rent it..."
positive,"CLAY AIKEN ROCKS!: I bought this cd along with clay aiken's single Solitaire last week. He has voice of an angel and I love how articulate he is when he sings with such passion from his heart and soul. WOW don't miss this one, he is awesome."
positive,"Fun swing jam session: This is a nice recording of swing and blues style guitar. Lots of fun to listen to -- like sitting in on a friendly jam session. Duke Robillard really shines on ""Avalon"" and the bluesier numbers and Herb Ellis sounds like he's having fun throughout. Recommended for swing fans or those new to jazz guitar."
positive,"Detecto 339: Excellent. Assembly easy, works perfectly and is made in USA.Highly recommmed Detecto products."
negative,"Disappointing: The book was one of the most funny I've read, and the film just didn't do it justice. One improvement is that Sonny's character is much sweeter and more likeable in the film than in the book, but the finer points of the story have been lost. The part about the beard, for example, which wasn't just very touching, and funny, but incredibly shocking to someone born in 1964 and had never known a time when beards were downright subversive! All the actors were excellent--but more of the book could have been written into the film.Also, to a previous reviewer, the time frame of the story is in the early '50's--they were NOT returning from the Vietnam War! The Korean War was in the early '50's; the Vietnam War didn't begin till 1964!"
negative,"Never arrived!: What a total ripoff! I ordered this 2 weeks ago and the postman never delived it. (In fact I think he quit because we have a new postman now.) If you order this make sure you choose the ""extra special handling"" shipping option."
negative,"RACIST,HOMOPHOBIC, HATE MONGER: And those are the nice things I have to say about this woman and her book. She's a young woman with a LOT to learn. She sounds like a one of those white far-right ""Christian"" nuts.By the way, if she doesn't believe in interracial relationships, why does she work with Sean ""Puffy"" Combs, who is dating Jennifer Lopez? Souljah would probably rationalize that Sean was driven to make it with Jennifer by our racist society. (Sean looks to me like he's having fun!)"
negative,"Don't Waste Your Money: One of my favorite movies!!Unfortunately, the picture and sound quality (dolby 2.0) on this DVD are very poor (even on an upconvert player).Not worth buying!Hopefully a better product will be released in the future."
positive,Question about a song: Does anyone know the same of the song being played during the Permian and Midland Lee game? Its played during the fourth quarter when the Panthers are attempting a comeback... I really would like to know the name of this song..
positive,Great bed for a great price: This is my first inflatable mattress and I was surprised at how quickly it inflated and deflated. Overall it gives us a great night's sleep!
positive,could be hotter: I wanted to like this device....nice long cord .....switch on the base.....nice looking....but...It just did not get hot enough for my taste.....nice and warm but not hot....as we get older we want hotter it seems.....tried different glass and ceramic cups but sorry not hot enough.....heater is 17 watt....would like to have one at about 25 watts.
negative,"Ethanol is for drinking: I would not recommend this book. Anyone looking into alternative fuel should consider biodiesel, or electric power. Ethanol is a waste. Anyway, this book provides some useless diagrams of how to not make a still at home."
positive,"Its the only novell I ever read to its completion: It may not appeal to some but it has a lot deeper meaning. It truly relates to the behaviour of the grown up adults. In present day world there are so many who controll or try to control what they got thier hands on and deprive many for the same. On the other hand their are so many innocent people who are given wrong or misinfomation and theirby led to the ignorance , stereotyping etc. Ralph the character who tries to bring the justice and stands for the truth ends up on the loosing side and is that not true of many experiences we see. The police always gives you a ticket for even a minor accidental mistake yet they feed so many criminals who are convicted. There are far too many good people but they just are too nice and the world is full of good and bad talents. Lord of flies is a good book if you read with clear mind you will get it"
positive,"a little biased!: I admit I'm a HUGE peter weller fan so it should be no surprise I loved this movie! One of his most overlooked films,paced terrifically from start to finish.Lori singer shines as his co-star,you won't regret adding this to your collection(plus it's getting harder to find)."
negative,"NOT IMPRESSED: Just got the game....NOT IMPRESSED! These 5 star reviews must have been written by the makers of the game, cuz this player thinks it [stinks]. Lara's movements are slow and chunky. Movements that used to be simple, such as jump back to get a run forward, has turned into spin Lara around, walk, and spin around again...and since this changes your view of the surroundings it's easy to get confused (camera angles [stink] too) Lara's control is a nuisance and it's NOT worth my time to play this game."
negative,"I've Had Enough: I'd just like to say that every track on this CD is wack, except for ""Lost Ones"". Lauryn Hill trying to sing makes me sick. She's a much better rapper. That's all I gotta say."
negative,"Read the BOOK!!!: This movie is so over rated. If you want to be amazed, read the book by Burgess, that will knock your socks off. The book is way better because it ends with Burgess original ending, something the movie doesn't end with. I wont tell you what happens just in case you do want to read it."
positive,Mr. B's Review: I showed this film to a bunch of middle schoolers. It was great! The historical impact and the religious significance was outstanding. This is a film for all those interested in Luther and the Reformation.
negative,"really really bad: i find it incredible that so many people speak so glowingly of this book. on the basis of its literary merit it deserves a prominent spot in supermarket checkout lanes. that this is in any way respected as a novel or thought of as remotely historical (pre-historical, is suppose) speaks sad volumes about our society.i guess my one star may be a bit harsh. it's concievable that one could glean some amusement or light entertainment from this. but i feel a civic duty to in bring down the five star average it's garnered so far."
positive,"A Philosophy Book Encapsulated in Discworld: I've been reading the Discworld books in order of publication, and this is the first one that diverged from the normal types of stories. This book was a pretty strong expression of Pratchett's religious stance, in my opinion. The humor wasn't as strong as other books, I thought it was almost more of a philosophy book, or a book of opinions on religion. I wasn't sure how to rate this as I enjoyed the views on religion, but thought they would be better written in a non-Discworld novel. For Discworld, I didn't think the storyline was very fitting. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up as well. If you're looking for Discworld humor, I wouldn't choose this book. If you want some views (primarily mocking) on religion, then it's good!"
negative,"Must Be Seconds?: These have to be seconds. Soon as I opened the packages.. I ordered 10 packages with 2 each inside I noticed frayed edges... a immediate ut oh to me. The seams aren't sewn smoothly all the way around there are strings hanging.Looked closer and the tags on them weren't in uniform spots. For the price I thought I would give them a shot so I washed them as advised by the manufactor before using. They came out of the washer and dryer as in different colors. A bad dye lot I guess. These washclothes ARE soft so thats why I gave them one star, however, they are badly sewn and I expected much more from Martex quality than this. Buyer beware."
negative,"Few Errors: If you read a ""Dummies"" book before then you know the format. The first part of the book is divided into lessons, then there are three sample tests in the back.I thought the lessons were good, but not great compared to some of the other ASVAB books out there. The book did a great job of telling you upcoming changes to the ASVAB as advertised.What really turned me off from this book was when I was doing the sample tests and there were a couple answers that were clearly wrong. For instance, the question for General Science was what Chromosomes does a female have. The answers in the back said ""XY"" while it should have been ""XX"". This was just one of a few I found.While the style remains the same as most dummies books, I cant recommend this to anyone based on the errors in the sample tests. If you dont plan on doing sample tests then this book might be for you."
positive,"Great Tai Chi: YMAA publications has done it again with Sunrise Tai Chi! Ramel Rones does a great job which makes this a superb DVD for everyone, young and old. I also purchased Sunset Tai Chi."
negative,"also disappointed: Received the book as a gift from my mother. I echo the concerns of other disappointed readers. Only ""6 to 8 Black Men"" made me laugh out loud. He paints his family in an unusually unflattering light - I grew weary of reading about how much coffee and wine his mother drank. The story about Anne Frank's apartment seemed out of place.Still, I recognize and respect what went into the book, and, like another reviewer, find it provocative. I'm not willing to abandon Sedaris based on one book. And I hope to experience the audio version."
positive,"I love my rainbows!: I love these shoes! I where them whenever I feel like it is going to be a lazy, hot, day. They are super comfortable. I get so much use out of them and they are great quality. They have not fallen apart at all. Strong, sturdy, comfortable flip-flops!"
positive,"Art History of the Highest Order!: This is a superbly written and researched account of Artemisia's Gentileschi's fascinating life and art. While not at all hostile to feminist interpretations of the painter, chiefly Mary Garrard's, Bissell is refreshingly skeptical and respectfully critical of many of their key points. Bissell is a more traditional art historian than I myself prefer, but one can't find better art history than this. Despite the high price, I wholeheardtedly recommend this wonderful book to anyone interested in Artemisia Gentileschi's paintings and as a feminsit icon."
positive,"despite what some may say: i do think they deserve their title as musicians. while they do work the lesbian gimmick (and it is a gimmick-read any recent interview-they love men. women are just pretty), they have some serious talent. on top of their singing ability, they have come up with several stuck-in-your-head songs. ever try to listen to all the things she said before you go to sleep? youll be hearing it when you wake up. overall, a four-star album."
positive,"Sucks you in.: Eragon is in the woods when he finds a 'stone' that will change his life forever. He is 16 and has a quint life in the small town he grow up in.As he ( and you) will soon find out, he is ment for much bigger things.I think that this is a graet story, no matter who you are."
positive,"Great to have in DVD form.: With modern TVs not having a VHS player, I had to order a copy in DVD form of the story my kids loved. It's still a great story now shown to my grandchild."
negative,"Fun For a Few Minutes, Until it needs fixing AGAIN!!: My son really wanted this toy and loves batman, so Grandma splurged on this expensive-for-what-you-get toy. First thing, it's a real bear to set up, and then when you do set it up it is really clumsy and pieces fall off very easily. The boys still had fun playing with it, even when the elevator constantly got jammed. They would have enjoyed it even more if they actually included at LEAST ONE character figure in the darn set. OOOPs, we did not notice until he opened the gift that the action figures used for the set were sold separately. All in all, don't waste your money."
positive,"Greatest thing since sliced bread!: As advertised, Canada Green Grass Seed WILL germinate and grow to an inch in just 6 days. In 14 days you have to mow the lawn. It grows like magic on sandy soil, rich soil and maybe (but haven't tried to yet) grow on cement. I have been using this product for over 4 years and the seed has never let me down. If you want a lush lawn in two weeks...Canada Green Grass Seed is the product you want! Amazon.com: Please continue to carry this wonderful product."
positive,"good product: I hate the feel of most foundations and this product works really well and gives life to middle age skin. Unfortunately Revlon is no longer making it so is no longer available. So happy to get some before your supply was goneRevlon Skinlights Instant Skin Brightener, SPF 15, 04 Bare Light, 1.5 fl oz (44.3 ml)"
positive,"Uncle Vanya was my personal favorite: Anton Chekhov was a writer who was able to capture the essence of life and inter-personal relationships in his stories. His writing is simple yet powerful and emotionally affecting. Uncle Vanya deals with envy, male-female relationships, despair, and takes a look at life from a realist perspective."
negative,"Not the Best: I picked up this book for English class and after reading it I can respect how many people really enjoyed this book and I can see why. It is written well and it does keep your interest. John Steinbeck's style is very unique and it is semi-enjoyable to read (although every other sentence contains a swear word.)The story is about two men, George and Lennie, who always look out for each other. Lennie is, well, ""different"" in that he loves to touch soft things. He has the mind of a two year old. George does his best efforts to look after Lennie, although Lennie does get into a lot of trouble. After being chased away from their previous town, George and Lennie get new jobs in hopes to someday own a ranch of their own.Though this book was written well and the plot was good, I didn't like the story line. It was very depressing and was annoying for me to read. Maybe I'm just one person in a million who didn't enjoy this book. Try it out and see what you think."
positive,"Excellent little battery: I purchased this battery as a backup for a vacation. It works perfectly. It is indistinguishable from the battery that came with the camera, lasts just as long (one or two days of frequent use), and charges fairly quickly in the standard charger. For folks going on a trip, I recommend taking two batteries for your camera. Just slip the spare into your pocket (not with your loose change or car keys, though) and pop it in when the camera needs it. Charging took a few hours overnight. For European current, my standard charger (not incl) said it takes the local voltage, so I only needed a plug adapter."
positive,"I bought it, but my daughter loved it!: I bought it but my daughter loved it so much it disappeared. She said it made her acne much better!We also loved the scent."
positive,"My favorite of all the Veggie Tales!: This one was the first Veggie Tales video I ever saw, and I think it's still my favorite! The Jurassic Park allusion is hilarious. Intelligent, funny, witty, not just for kids but adults too."
positive,"Every second counts: Will my future change because of this one second I stopped to look at this dress in the window? Will I alter other peoples' lifes by bumping into them? - You have never asked yourself those questions? Well, you certainly will after seeing this movie. 'Run Lola Run', a German movie, is fantastically made and keeps your heart beating rapidly down to the last second of it. Lola's boyfriend got into trouble. And now Lola has 20 minutes to get 100,000 German Marks. The phone hits the floor and Lola starts running... Americans, who are usually not very fond of foreign movies, should not let the 'dubbed' stop them. Dare to watch it and a race is waiting for you. Tom Tykwer created a 90 minute video clip. Fast, unstopable, exciting. And the one minute you spent thinking about getting this movie will change your life."
positive,"John Welte's Review: The Lord of the Flies was a book that I was required to read at the start of tenth grade. When I started reading the book I wasn't interested right away. I thought the book lacked any action, and I couldn't identify with any of the characters, personally. Honestly, I kept reading because of obligation. Eventually I realized it was a good book. Towards the second half of the book the author added action and the characters evolved. Arguments took place among the boys which started fighting and drama. When the story started picking up it had me excited until the very end. Overall, I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a great adventure book."
negative,"Warning! Warning!: Warning! Warning! Will Robinson. This software is defective. Unless you are planning to spend a lot of time uninstalling, reinstalling and searching the Internet for free help (Sage provides virtually no technical support for this or any Act! products), you a recommended to stay far, far away from any version of Act! for Palm (1,2, or 3)."
positive,"Wonderful read: I've only read a quarter of the book but it's wonderful. It's written well and is not far out there. Some inspirtional books are so deep I get lost and can't relate it to my life. This one is truely ""inspirational""."
positive,"Rosemary from Laguna Niguel, CA: The Dead Zone is the first time I have viewed a motion picture that was better then the novel-far better. The music and the photograpy built a haunting atmosphere with a touch of sadness.All the characters in the film were outstanding, but the key to the story was Chris Walken's performance. Until he played this role, I had never visualized how a magical gift that helps others could become a curse.Two visuals in the film made me appreciate the creativity of Chrononbergs work and demonstrated the power of film over words.1. The moment Walken touches someone hand and the impact of the vision becomes viseral and physical.2. The scene where Walken views the crime on the gazebo. The fact that he can see the crime unfold but can not stop it is almost painful but exhilerating to watch for it's mastery.Last, but not least, the scene where Walken confronts Colleen Duhurst with the word ""You Knew"" is stunning.I never get tired this masterpiece and Walken's performance."
negative,"Not a story for true King Arthor fans.: I am a true fan of the King Arthor legands and of the writings of Mark Twain, but this novel does not meet up to either things. Basically the writing is not as well done as his other stories like Tom Sawyer and it puts down the whole legand of the Round Table. If you are inclined to be romantic about the Arturian period definitly do not read this story. I wish that I could have enjoyed this more, but there was little to make me love it"
positive,"Intricate, complex, flowing, exciting . . .: The environmental pictures painted are peerless. The characterizations are excellent. The religious intrigue, while not mystical or deep, is nonetheless captivating (especially if you're a fan of messianic, ""Chosen One"" tales). And the story is wonderful! If you like fantasy, sf, or great novels in general, check it out. (But be sure to get this new Ace edition; it certainly can't have _more_ typos than the Putnam hardcover.)"

The connector does not fit. I had to find another connector that would fit tightly into my computer and splice it onto the Adapter so I could use it."
negative,"Decent observations but long winded!: This book is long! Even though half of it is chemical breakdowns of almost every type of drug. Not bad but very long winded towards the end, found myself flipping just to interesting parts. Was hoping for some insight into DMT but found nothing. I guess this is good for your basement chemist but not to good for any insights into the expansion of the mind."
negative,"Not what I expected: I did not even finish this one, it could not hold my interest, and I was surprised that it was reviewed well."
positive,"A great start for an American industrial band: Imperative Reaction combines the depressing lyrics of American industrial bands (Skinny Puppy, Nine Inch Nails, and Praga Khan) with the inspired, organized, and atmospheric electronic music of European industrial bands. Eulogy has some great tracks on it (Scorpio, The Longing, Overcast), while some just seem like fillers. Overall, I think this a great debut release for Imperative Reaction, and that they should be commended for implementing the more European style to their sound."
positive,"Not your average pop rock: I've purchased a lot of ""promising"" pop rock albums over the last 4 or 5 years and most of them have barely been worth the time it took to trade them in at the local used CD shop. This one is different. These guys are very good musicians, the lyrics are well above average, and the compositions rock in a good way, unlike some of the loud, talentless bands that seem to dominate the airwaves lately. I'd really like to give it 4 1/2 stars - it's not perfect but deserves more then 4."
positive,"Great!!: I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband, he loved it! Meguiar's is his favorite brand for car cleaning supplies and he is very meticulous about his car."
negative,Bodybuilder to Screen: Steve Reeves.The Hercules-Movies started Reeves' career and showcase him rather good.The digital quality is dabateble as well as the storyline. It's almost not worth the time it takes you to watch it.
positive,"Good product.: Seems to work as advertised. I opted for the non-battery back up, as my heating system has electric blower, so if power goes, heating system does not opearate. Battery/non-battery an individual judgment.Pros: ""ready light"" is not so bright as to be disturbing at night, if it is a visible location, as mine is; simple plug in operation; you can test alarm manually.Cons: its a bit larger than it looks in the pictures, so depending on where you mount it, might be unappealing to actually see the unit installed in a highly visible wall outlet. Instructions indicate not to mount behind curtains, etc. as air flow might be restricted. However, I could not find a ""micro"" unit.Observations: Obviously no safe method to test if the unit actually detects CO.Suggestion: put a pass-through female outlet in the unit, as it uses one plug in the typical wall outlet, and this feature would be helpful in a older home with fewer wall outlets."
negative,"What happened?: After releasing one of my favorite Country albums, ""It Matters To Me,"" ""Faith"" went in the wrong direction. The songs are completely droned out by assembly-line like production. I some songs on the album, like This Kiss, Love Ain't Like That, Let Me Let Go, Me, and My Wild Frontier, but even they fall victim. The album is pieced together, also - for example, the guitar rhythm to Let Me Let Go sounds manufactured and not in continuity with the other songs. I've never liked the song The Secret Of Life, both on this album and the version by Gretchen Peters. ""Somebody Stand By Me"" is too bombastic. Often, Faith's voice sounds more strained on this album than on her others. Hopefully, Faith Hill will do better again next time."
positive,"Clever, very clever: This book has a clever plot, a clever story and is very, very witty. The book consists of sections of one or two pages, at most, which simultaneously tell the story, give insight on how the main character thinks, and provide a witticism of some sort. At first it annoyed me, as I prefer a more continuous prose, and the witticisms were making it hard for me to concentrate on the story. :-) But this book is so good that this soon ceased to be of any importance.This is very good science fiction. If you like science fiction in general, you'll like this book."
positive,Perfect Nursery Addition!: Our daughter is now 14 months old and still loves her aquarium. When she wakes up in the middle of the night she turns it on and it soothes her back to sleep. She also loves staring at it while it lulls her to sleep. The music is gentle and the lights are soft --- a perfect addition to the crib!
positive,"A Masterpiece!!!! A Must-Own Movie: A Clockwork Orange... I did not like this movie the first time that I saw it...I must admit that. I gave this movie another chance, however, and found it to be hypnotizingly stimulating. This movie is truly a work of art and a masterpice in itself. Kubrick is a genius."
negative,"Measuring a Man? Not high on my scale: I believed that Clay would be someone who could bring something different to the table. But in fact his album is everything thats wrong with the pop world. The songs are bland and he is trying to appeal to one group instead of his entire fan base. The songs are very meh and so contrived you would have thought he recorded them yesterday in the car. This album is not what the record industry needs to spruce itself up. Barry Manilow and Micheal Bolton already reign the Adult COntempory charts why do we need more cheesy pop songs??? This is an album controlled by the makers of American Idol, not a record company. Its a shame that the other idols have respectable albums even if they are not blockbusters. Measure of a Man is strictly produced to make money not to be a sensation. It would be nice to see some crativity in this! very disappointing!"
positive,Lasting Entertainment: Our two-year-old has been playing with this playhut for weeks non-stop. There are so many different ways to configure it.
negative,"I hated and I hate it now: My sister got this thing, and made me listen to it. I really don't hate a lot of music, but this. *shudder* This is terrible, on all levels.First, there was the ""lesbian"" stunt, which was simply disgusting and cheap. Even if they WERE actually lesbians, they way they played up that angle was just... repulsive.Well, fine, publicity smublicity. If the music is good, we can forgive that cheat stunt.Ha. The music? Generic, forgettable dance. And the voices are annoying and ear-drum shatteringly shrill. And repeatative. Since I didn't get enough of the singer's shrieking out ""They're not gonna get us"" the first time! Eugh... And they don't even write or anything on their songs. All they do is sing. In short, UGH."
positive,Good introduction to the subject: Well written and an easy read. A good introduction to some historical concepts that have been ignored by the mainstream.
positive,I love it Ray J has soul!: I love this cd so much! hes really grown up hes only about a year older then me but hes still sexy and he can sing sing sing i love the majority of his cd i love blue high heels melody one wish and war is over featuring his sister brandy hes stepped his game up and hes not a little boy anymore so if you like rnb and good sounding music go out and cop this cd its a real slow jam banga! im lovin it! hes so so sexy now too hes grown up and i think his cd is underated by most people so if you like soul and rnb and hip hop all rolled into one you will love this cd i guarantee you'll be playing it on the regular i know iam! its one of my favorites! love it love it he has such a great vocal range and a great body too :-) so if you like soulful great fun love music get this cd and stop hatin on the brotha for makin some good tunes that you can really groove to cause im lovin it i give it all 5 stars!
positive,Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel: I have read this book a few times since it came out. It had to be replaced because it was faling apart and I could not find anyone to repair it. Looking forward to getting the last book in the series in hardback.
positive,"Excellent 8-step process on ""How-to"" be a business coach: Short - easy to read and filled with concrete ""how-to"" information on a collaborative process for facilitating change in someone's performance. The author's 8-step model is based on 20 years research into the ""best practices"" of successful business performance managers. Very common sense and practical."
negative,Falling apart: Book is good but the binding is falling apart. Never bought a book before where the pages fell off. Pity.
negative,"Hilarious BECAUSE some jokes are recycled: Airplane II is the perfect sequel to a parody movie like Airplane!. As a major complaint about sequels is they simply repeat the original with subtle changes it only makes sense for the sequel to Airplane to address this directly by almost copying some jokes almost verbatim. I sometimes enjoy the sequel more because the jokes never stop, in Airplane!, the last 20 minutes were slow with the jokes as the plot was being wrapped up.I am giving the DVD only 1 star because it only has the movie, no special features not even an audio commentary. I would have loved to have the theatrical version and a version with every scene available. The movie is only 86 minutes; there would have been room on the DVD.The movie itself gets 5 stars"
positive,"I was laughing in tears at the theather!: A friend at work told me that this movie was very funny, so my husband and I made a trip to the theater and sure was, we almost stopped breathing from laughing! I saw a guy sitting across the ales laughing so hard that his popcorn fell of his hands.The Brits did a good job and I doubt that a new remake in 2010 from United States is worth a watch!"
negative,"Pretty good, for a while: I wanted to like this case; it feels like it should be sturdier than the OEM case, and it definitely looks more professional (though I'm not convinced that it's really leather). It is tight out of the box; the sock trick works well. The latch has a couple of big metal chunks that will probably wear through the liner and destroy your screen unless you get in the habit of turning the phone around (so it's less convenient to pull it out and use it). And mine broke after about 6 weeks of fairly lightweght use; the belt clip button detached itself from the case. It looks like the only thing holding it together was a little oval of double-stick tape.OK, what do you expect for eight bucks?"
positive,"Awesome: Is this book great, or what? But seriously, it is a rare insight into the bitter rewards of power, along with all the other levels this book has to offer. Religeon; how much of this is created, & how much is self-creating. Economics; Muad'Dib - the supreme energy eater. Politics: Bene Tlalaxu, Bene Gesserit, House Atredies, The House of Ix, The Fremen, The Guild, oh yeah. Finally, this concludes the story of Paul Atredies (The Preacher is another story...) who sought to make his future, only to find his future made him."
negative,"Anne of Green Gables The Continuing Story: For those who fell in love with the first two installments of ""Anne of Green Gables,"" you need not waste your time on the final. Although it was good to see the main characters, Anne and Gilbert, marry, the Continuing Story is so far removed from the previous stories that viewers will find it difficult to connect them. The richness and wonder found in the first two films are totally absent in the final. After watching Continuing Story, I immediately threw it in the trash, then watched the first two again, and ""pretended"" the third didn't exist."
negative,Not a great movie!: I thought it was pretty bad. Hostel was better than this crap. I mean it was ok in some parts but I didn't expect much. It's not even scary. I can't wait to watch Hostel 2 when it comes out.
negative,"Great premise, bad movie: What a great premise. Mel Gibson, a male chauvanist of the worst order, can hear what women think. The previews looked like the movie was going to be a great comedy. If you're looking for comedy, though, just watch the previews. All of the funny parts are in the previews, and the movie turns into a romantic drama about Mel Gibson's character reforming and seeking better relationships with his daughter and boss. This had all the makings of a truly fun comedy, and there are great actors in this movie, but it just doesn't satisfy. Perhaps if I had known going in that this movie was a drama, I would have appreciated it more, but this is a movie in search of a theme. Also, Mel Gibson's character is hard to like as he first is a chauvanist, then uses his gift to manipulate people, then finally reforms. By the time he's turned things around, it's too late to turn this movie around. Definately one that I would skip."
positive,Simple Read and Informative: A great book for beginners to understand the principles of management. It is simply written to make it easier to understand and really breaks down some principles that we all do in everyday life. A must for all even if not taking a class because all of us will either manage or be managed.
negative,"Dull Blades: I ordered these replacement cartridges and the blades were dull. The first shave was like a blade that I should have discarded. I tried another one, same thing. The price was right, but the shave would have been better with a dull steak knife......."
positive,"Hypnotic sounds abound on this great Yello CD: This is one of my favourite Yello albums. It is inventive, amusing, creative and fun to listen to. Some of the songs are very moody and atmospheric, others are upbeat. It's better than older Yello in my opinion and a good place to start if you are new to their sound."
negative,"Item did not work: I was shipped what appeared to be a refurbished charger. On top of the fact this item was refurbished, it did not work. As if the upset and inconvenience of receiving a product that does not work wasn't enough, once I returned this item to sender they had the audacity to charge a ""restocking fee"". I certainly won't ever purchase from this seller ever!"
negative,"THIS BOOK IS THE ROOT OF EVIL: An awful abortion of a hollow excuse of a ""book."" This book is to literature what the Spanish Inquisition is to the Catholic Church: A painful memory that all would prefer to be wiped out forever.This mystery ""thriller"" tells the tale of an American woman living in Japan (wherein readers will find nothing but abhorrent stereotypes, i.e. her ex-boyfriend was a samurai who eats dogs he finds on the streets). Also, the overuse of ninjas and Godzilla are further anachronisms in a novel that is fruitlessly trying to be relevant, daring, and realistic.Simply the worst book I have ever seen. I wish I were blind."
negative,"defective, very disappointed: This tabletop pocket chart arrived with a defect and I had to return it to get my money back. The inside of each clear plastic pocket was covered with an extra layer of cheap, tear-able, thin plastic. Several places it was torn, creating a messy obstructed view for any pictures or words I would put in the plastic pockets. This made the product unusable."
positive,"This Great Album!: It was great! I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this! This is one of my favourite albums by system of a down, and now I finally have it!"
positive,"New Nightmare: A new fantastic nightmare of Wes Craven.In this nightmare is the job for a real freddy in the real world.Heather Langenkamp(Nancy Thompson part one and part three)Has ""new nightmares""about Freddy butt Freddy is a bit changed.He is more scarrier than ever.This is the real story of Freddy Krueger sure you don't miss this one allright?Fantastic idea of Wes Craven."
positive,"An Outstanding Read: An outstanding read about how MacArthur conducted his staff, and how he conducted the entire war. It is interesting because it included first-hand accounts and how the dealings were conducted during this time. MacArthur's communications with the various world leaders offers insights into the how the interactions were conducted, as well as background as to who was invloved and why they occurred. For anyone interested in MacArthur, it is an outstanding book."
positive,"an excellent read: I agree, this book is excellent and a MUST read if you have the slightest interest in nomadic empires of Central Asia."
positive,classic television: What can I say about this show except it is a good example of what a classic series is all about. Any John Ritter fan has to add this to their collection. I intend to purchase the entire series.
negative,"very bad movie: Too much profanity, too much bad dialog, and a poor plot all combine for one lousy movie.Chuck norris is a cop who is double crossed by his partner. He ends up being sent undercover to bust the mob who is in life and death battle with Iranian hit men. Turns out the Iranians are working for his old partner who tried to kill him at the beggining of the movie.Every other word in this movie starts with an F and ends wtih K and the action/fight scenes are very poor.I'd stay away from this movie at all costs.Rich"
positive,"My Favorite Shakespeare: The language wraps you up and transports you to a time and land like no other. It's full of love, hate, brutality, and loyalty. All these emotions get tangled up and mixed together. That lends itself to an amazing set of circumstances. There is no greater love story than Juliet and her fair Romeo. All other love stories are measured against this one and you will get lost in this classics story. It's a true classic."
positive,"A book unlike any other: This book captured my attention quite unlike anything else that I have read. The building up of each character was a work of art, the story fantastically woven between the threads of an ancient tale of tragedy and love. everything about this book made me reconsider what I truly believed to be true literature."
negative,not compatible with i phone or other electronics: I needed to extend my usb cable and this does not recognize my iPhone or a few other electronic products. I would confirm with seller it is compatible before buying.
negative,"Terrible: This book is just bad. If you are an eleven year old kid who's never experienced what true fantasy literature has to offer, I highly recommend it. You've got to start at the bottom after all ;-) Reading this will make discovering the true masters of the genre that much more delightful.My suggestion--don't waste money on the hardcover if you bother to pick it up at all."
positive,"Outstanding!: Billy does it again! Always funny, BC is right on the edge.Wish more of his stage act was available to the U.S. market on DVD."
positive,"Significant improvement over my USB wireless: I had a USB wireless adapter that got 50-60% signal strength. This this adapter, I get around 90%. I've absolutely no problems with this card and have been impressed by it's performance."
negative,Nothing but problems: The light came without the batteries that were supposed to be included. Batteries were very difficult to find and quite expensive. Even with batteries the xenon light did not work. So now I have a very expensive led flashlight with hard to replace batteries. The case was nice however.
negative,"Do not buy this...: I bought this after considering all brands and thought that for the price this would be a great player. The next day I sat on an airplane for 5 hours. The only problem I had this day was that it would skip once in a while and sometimes the picture and they audio were not in sync. On the return flight there were major problems. I turned the unit on and it worked for about 2 minutes. Then the monitor went out. After planning on relaxing and watching a movie this made the flight very long, boring, and frustrating. I took this player back when I got home and purchased a better brand. For anybody considering purchasing this I have just this one piece of advice. Forget about it."
negative,"Too many characters: I read this book and I thought it was good at first but there were so many characters that I would often forget who was who. After a while I had to write down which character was which because there are far too many of them and I was getting tired of having to go back in the book to find out who Frost was talking about. I have never in my life had to do that on any other book.The only thing I really enjoyed about the book was the Japanese man (I can't remember his name because it has been a year since I read it) because I am into the martial arts.Overall, I'd say it wasn't all that good. Don't buy it."
positive,"Playing the HAARP: I first saw this at the Lefont Tara, which only showed art films. It was excellent, and I spent years trying to track it down on videotape, then more years waiting for the DVD. I always wondered if the similarity of the experiment in the movie to the present day, secrecy shrouded, Tesla based HAARP experiment by the US government was one of the reasons it was so hard to find, but then I do love my conspiracy theories. I think the US does have a HAARP array in Australia, they do have a bunch of antennas that may or may not be connected to HAARP there.It can't be that it was hard to find because of the quality, it's a great movie, and based on the ebay bids when I bought it on tape, lots of people think so."
positive,ROSEMARYS BABY: This is a fantastic movie. They don't make them like this anymore.I would recommend this one for a must see!!
positive,"Works exactly as it should: I received a TiVo box for Christmas and hooked it up in January. Instead of running wires all over the place I purchased the TiVo wireless USB adapter to connect the TiVo box to my existing wireless network. I simply actived the TiVo service online, then plugged the TiVo box to my home theatre, plugged in the TiVo wireless adapter, and followed the on-screen menu instructions. Everything worked perfectly, the first attempt. How many electronic / computer products do that, do you think? By the way, I am just an average computer user with few networking skills. I chose the TiVo brand adapter instead of others available to assure easy software compatibility."
positive,"More than I expected: I received this nailer for Father""a Day. I work with oak lumber primarily so I had some concerns. I stacked 3 pieces of 3/4 inch oak on top of one another and this thing countersunk a 2"" nail in them, needless to say it's up to the task. Also very lightweight."
negative,"Not worth the money...: After a cheap rice cooker I had for years died, I thought I would upgrade and get this one. I wish I had heeded some of the reviews I saw on here. First of all, it is difficult to read the water level lines on the inside of the pot. I am young and thought it couldn't be that bad. It is. I have to hold the pot directly under a light to see the markings at all. Also, I often find that my rice is not cooked through when the cooker indicates it is finished. The final straw for me is that it is pretty cumbersome to clean. If it made perfect rice, the cleanup wouldn't be an issue, but I'm not sure that the rice in this cooker has ever turned out as good as the cheap one I used to have that I picked up at Target. I am now going back to a cheaper model - don't want to spend a bunch of money to end up with a dud again."
positive,Humorous practical advice for nice girls: Very good book. Lots of practical advice on how to handle yourself with men. Argov really helps to demystify the male psyche. A must read for any women interested in intensifying her relationship and getting more of what SHE wants!
positive,"Mad Max (Special Edition): I won't go into a review of the movie itself as there are many on here already. I knew the movie before buying it, liked it, which is why I bought it.This review is to let folks know about the Special Edition. For those of you looking for it, yes, this has the original Australian audio. It also happensto have the English dubbed version, just so you can remember what it was like being little and watching this on TV for the first time. Plenty ofextras and great quality, this made for an excellent 'guys night'.One thing I never really figured out about these movies... Mad Max doesn't really seem especially... mad. I mean, he's mad, but I always thoughtmad was supposed to mean crazy. He's not all that crazy. Makes for great alliteration though."
positive,"~ MAGICAL~: Ok, so I collect holiday CD's and have Many! THIS one is my all time favorite. The whole family loves it. We take it out Thanksgiving and play it non-stop through the holidays. It is hard to describe because of the different melodies, some serene, some lively. Did I mention that I love this cd?!"
positive,"Hot Lead and Cold Feet: My 91 yr old Mom and my two grandaughters, ages 8 yr & 5 yr love this movie. Honestly, it is not a movie I would have bought for myself; but watching them enjoy it is more then enough joy."
positive,Don't go by the Reviews!: This book is a perfect beach read! Women everywhere can relate to the spunky Emily and her relationship woes. This is a hysterical and sensationally sassy debut by Gerlach! You will find yourself laughing out loud!
negative,"Consider Carefully: ""High Speed""? Don't think so. These units are easy to set up and install, and are feature-rich. They might work fine if you only have a few users (like under 10), but I experienced serious performance issues with only 25 users connected. They slow down seriously when you run a decent amount of traffic through them."
positive,air ratchet: air ratchet workes on 4cfms of air witch is about all my compressor can handle. it has good speed and power also workes in tight quarters witch is what i need when i work on my equipment.couple that with good service and quick delivery. works for me.
negative,Another King Bomb: I wish Stephen King would realize that he does his best writing in novellas and short stories and lay off the over-long novels which only fill pages. And please....try writing a novel with no children in it. Look back over King's novels and you'll find he seldom gets away from this ploy. How about his giving us a nice 300 pager full of adults and maybe then he might be scary again. By the time I read the last chapter I was hoping all of the characters would die and Mr. Gray would win. Perhaps he's killed his leg demons now and can try writing something less soul cleansing and more mature.
negative,"Maceo good, album bad.: The things I dislike about this album have actually already been mentioned: many of the songs go on way too long (they're the big long concert versions), and the editing is really bad. Respectively, this means that the album has all the disadvantages of a live album and none of the atmosphere or excitement. If you're a big Maceo fan, go ahead and get this - I really liked tracks 5&6, and his playing is great. If you're not, look for the dozens of other records which he appears on."
positive,"Coffee table book: ""Great Smoky Mountains"": I bought this book for a wedding gift for a couple who love the Smokey Mountains. It was well received, with lots of glowing comments on the beauty of the photography and the descriptive writing. I highly recommend this book!"
positive,"MIGHTY ENDING: I have to say this: I enjoyed this book from top to bottom. Terry is there all right, with its excelent writing and a very, very odd way of looking at things. Of course, you laugh your eyes out in almost every page, specially with the screams of the shelled God Om and the comentaries of Dydactilus and Urn. And the book has one of the best endings I have read in a very long time. Lets just said:I. Is Godly.II. Respect tortoises over yourself.P.S. If I had the incredible memory of Brutha, surely I would be a prophet, without the requisite of crossing the desert, although maybe not having that much fun."
negative,"Never Worked: My daughter is a strong little girl and though she needed to be swaddled in order to actually sleep...she fought it most of the time. I bought this item in hopes that it would be comfortable for her and easy to use. Needless to say she unswaddled herself easily and could not sleep as a result. Admittedly not all children make valiant attempts at getting out of their blankets, however my little girl was pretty intent. I never could use this item and had to revert to using larger blankets until she no longer needed to be swaddled."
positive,"Beatles Still Rule!!!: There's no doubt about it that this is their masterpiece after SGT. PEPPER. The best song on it is ""Blue Jay Way"". If you're a true Beatle fan like me, I recommend that you get this one and listen. You'll enjoy it. I promise."
positive,"Makes me look like a i have a perfect hourglass figure: I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. my only complaints are that it is a little too short, so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me, but overall, it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased. i love it and would recommend it to anyone."
negative,"It was ""ok"" but I won't watch it again: I watched this last night. And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen."
positive,really works!: i set my coffee on it at 8 and it is still HOT at noon!!! I have tried many many mug warmers this one works!
negative,"I am going to bring Hawthorne back from the grave to hit him: Aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, this the worst book i've ever read, I consider myself open to all fine lterature but I absolutely hate this book. But the writing is superb!"
positive,"Censorship has never felt so real...: This book blew me away, but to appreciate it, you must understand how technology has affected us and how we already act. Plus, you must understand, that this book was written in the 50s where they thought we would be even further in the future.In the time of Guy Montag, no book-readers were free. they were behind bars, or running from the law; and he was one of the people who put them there.this book is so moving and compelling i could only grasp the rhythm of Bradbury and his magnificent language that lets you know the fear and hatred of Montag.Before you start, you need to know that this book will be weird and confusing. You must appreciate philosophy and know how strange this world is."
negative,"Not worth your time!: As of now I am completing drivers Ed. We take tests over this book, and I feel it is rather outdated for what it is being used for. The pictures are helpful, but the text I found boring and most of the text seemed just to be fill. They streched out simple procedures, and filled the usefull information with unimportant details. If you want to pass the test, read your state drivers manual. If you think this will help you, try it, but I warn you, its not worth it. Your state drivers manual is worth you time, check it out!"
negative,"dissapointed in ocean wonders aquarium crib toy: I recieved this for my baby shower. I had a daughter who was born deaf and she LOVED this toy! She loved the bubbles and the fish swimming as well as the lights! She didn't use it until she was three months old (this is how old she was when she came home from the hospital FINALLY!) She loved this thing!!! When she became 5 months old the bubbles stopped working and it leaked out some water and with no bubbles, the fish don't swim. All she has to entertain her are the lights and that really doesn't do the job she needs more action. I was very dissapointed, it was an older model I guess and was not serviceable. I have to throw it away and by something else."
negative,"Can't agree with other reviewers: I am a big fan of Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott. I bought this DVD because of them and the glowing reviews. I have to say that I didn't enjoy this one at all for many reasons.I watched the first hour before I gave up on it and did not find one scene to be memorable or engrossing. The characters were all stereotypes with no real development to make them real. Tom Selleck's character lacked all the touches that made his other characters special. The plot was typical cowboy cliches. The soundtrack was loud, extremely dated, and annoying.I could sit and watch all eight hours of Lonesome Dove at one time or a dozen hours of Deadwood. I didn't even bother to finish watching this and I don't feel like I missed anything. If it had been good enough to keep watching, I would have given it two stars.Oh well, back to Quigley Down Under, Crossfire Trail, and Monte Walsh for me."
negative,too had to read: I find the old english wording too hard to understand and too hard to read...haven't got into it too far yet but it is taking me forever to get here
positive,"Pigs are Great, REAL GREAT: Please disregard the statement below that reads (and I quote): ""pigs are not well like for good reasons"". I dare call that person a pompous jerk. Pigs are great for a million reasons and Babe, as a cinematic art, strives to show that. Who sings ""la la la la la"" to the animals? Who talks to the sheep? Who saves the day when the farmer is down on his luck? The answer to all of these is Babe, a pig. The hero pig of this movie. I ask Mr. Pigs aren't great, what would you do if I pig offered a hoof to help you out? Walk on you say? I think not. I think not.In conclusion, pigs are great and this movie shows how great they are."
negative,"Three Lines Do Not Always Equal Haiku: Haiku is a Japanese lyric with a deceptively simple form: 17 syllables in three lines of 5,7,5 syllables. Strictly speaking, a haiku must contain a ""season word"" and restrict itself to condensed, defined, natural imagery. Those are the outward rules, and they are rules which can be (and are) broken. It is in the inward force of a rich combination of Taoism, Buddhism and Shintoism that gives haiku it's power and grace. THE HAIKU YEAR, while an interesting experiment, is problematic in that much of it appears to imitate haiku and the powerful subtlety for which haiku is known is simply not there. Aspiring haiku writers would do better to consult the translations by R.H. Blyth, THE HAIKU ANTHOLOGY (of English language haiku) by Cor van den Heuvel, and the indispensable and well-respected THE HAIKU HANDBOOK by William Higginson."
positive,Please Release on DVD: This was a wonderful concert celebrating a landmark album from Nanci Griffith. The guest artists were superb. Please release on DVD !!
negative,"Not the best: I am an avid reader so when I had an assignment in my Psychology class I was excited to see what there was to offer on Erik Erikson. I read the reviews on this book and it was promising. I bought it from Amazon.com and it came quickly, quicker then it said it would. I got through the first chapter all right but then things just went downhill. It was boring, I found it not to be well written. I normally enjoy reading about his theories and studies but this was not a great book. I would not recommend this book."
negative,"Don''t believe the hype: Hearing wonderful reviews of Moby, I decided to check out this album myself. I was very dissapointing. To me, most of the first few tracks are unlistenable. The best song on the album, South Side, is terrific. A wonderful duet with Gwen Stefani of No Doubt, South Side can find a place in everyone's library of music.Porcelain is another good song, with a very relaxing string orchestra, and although it may not be better than South Side, it delivers very well.Don't be the album, just buy those two songs.It'll save you money and stress."
positive,evergreen: THE COCKTAIL PARTY is a very good play. As a matter of fact it is a real joy listening to it and following the text. Every time I do I discover some new meaning in this great masterpiece. I am very happy with it.G. Martini
negative,"Absolutely Useless: I was very excited, but i should have listened to the other reviews on this product. It sharpened about half of the first pencil and then stalled. I tried cleaning out the shavings tray, different pencils, different amounts of pressure on the pencils and nothing worked. The motor completely stopped working after that first half of a pencil. I am returning it and will not be buying anything from X-acto ever again!!!"
negative,"If i had one wish...: I'd make this guy go for good. I was listening to the rap/R&B station just to see what crap they would play. Well, some R&B and rap is good, but this is literally the most annoying song/album this year. ""If I had one wish...If I had one wish...If I had one wish..."". I wanna kill the person who wrote this song."
positive,Scott: While this book does not dive into the details as some other reviewers have pointed out it does provide concise and easy to read chapters. I bought it specifically for the chapters on integrating with Apache and Struts. I found both chapters excellent not to detailed views of how each worked and what I needed to do to use it.This book will not hold your hand but is an excellent guide along the way.
negative,"cell phone battery: I can't charge the cell phone battery. I even took it to Sprint, to see if they could charge it. Nothing happen. I was told that the machine could not identify the battery. What a dispointment."
negative,WRONG 1: SENT THE WRONG ONE-RETURNED IT -FOUND IT CHEAPER AT A DIFFERENT WEB SITE-GOT THE SAME BRAND (DASHMAT)OTHER SITE WORKS GREAT NO PROBLEMS
positive,"Great Film * Average DVD Set: Gladiator is one of my top favorites, but this extended version is missing DTS sound and the extended scenes aren't all that. Nothing extremely special with this version."
negative,"Not a good followup...: The Old Grey Whistle Test hosted some incredibly groundbreaking FULL CONCERTS, two of which were the original Bob Marley and The Wailers, and Return To Forever (performing most of Romantic Warrior). Bootlegs of many of these shows are available but were recorded from nth generation tapes. Any one of these classic full shows would have been a much better choice for release than this hit and miss (mostly miss) collection of singles. I'm disappointed in this, and I believe they will be too once they see their sales numbers."
negative,BOOTLEG: The boxed set I received was an obvious bootleg copy. Super annoyed and disappointed with my purchase. . . .
negative,"Slow, marginally entertaining: While the scenes and acting were good and were mostly faithful to the original TV show, the movie plodded along and at a couple points had us asking whether it was over yet."
negative,"No help!!!: Difficult to rate. Product came with no help at all as to installation and/or creation of a system that would allow the rental of the movies. Neither TIVO nor Amazon has been helpful in solving my problem and the system, therefore, does not work. Cannot rate very well."
negative,"Rover Dangerfield: This is a great movie. The problem I had was not in the movie, but in the ""DVD""...how are you going to sell a dvd without giving a warning that it can ONLY be played on some dvd players, NOT on PCs. I had to learn this while I'm deployed, so returning it is almost not an option (we shall see though). I know that it's not a big deal but then again, in this day and age, when people use their laptops for watching movies, along with PS3s, Xbox 360s, and dvd players, they should cover all the bases, not just one."
negative,"I can't believe this is Pearl Jam...: How do I begin? First off, Pearl Jam is my favorite band and I love every one of their CD's...up until this one. Pearl Jam's last album ""Yield"" was arguably the best one they have made. I had such high expectations for this album, but I bought it the first day it came out...and I am so dissapointed. I just can't believe that this is the same band that has just made the 5 best rock albums of the decade (Ten, Vs., Vitalogy, No Code, Yield)...it shocks me how fast a band really can go down hill. Their is not even one notable good song on this album...it's all easily forgettable. Their last two albums (No Code, Yield) were Pearl Jam's best yet, and then they make this. I was so sure that they were just going to keep getting better like they always have...but I was wrong. Pearl Jam has always been my favorite band, and they still are, but this just proves that their best days are behind them...although their best days were not so long ago..."
positive,"Interesting storyline: I'm not a fan of sci-fiction, but really enjoyed it. I agree with other reviews that environment wasn't deeply described and there weren't any sophisticated characters, but this didn't disturbed me, because the storyline was fast-paced and interesting. I couldn't put this book down before it was over."
negative,"RUN!!!! RUN FAR AWAY!!!: This product is junk. It is cheaply constructed and broke the instant I attempted to place my palm TX in it. The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it. The memory card slots are a joke and the shoddy belt clip is the punch line. Without a doubt, the worst online purchase I have ever made."
positive,"So many uses: This are great for so many things and I try to get a travel pack in the car.Small spillsSticky messes on little fingersDiaper changingSticky messes where little hands have beenWiping a table at a fast food restaurantCleaning up after ""accidents""There are many more uses for these and it's a good idea to always have an extra pack on hand."
negative,"A Boastful Thread That Runs So True: I just finished reading this book. I too, am a teacher with many years of experience. I felt that Jesse Stuart spent the majority of his words glorifying his macho self image. Maybe, in his day, this was acceptable behavior for school personnel...thank goodness we have evolved to a more tolerant, loving, and understanding mode of operating our schools."
positive,Wonderful old songs: This is a really wonderful CD. I remember the music from my youth and can't believe how good these old songs sound today nearly 50 years later. The mastering is excellent with very open and dynamic sound.
positive,"Visually Stunning: I loved the Movie, it has everyting Great direction, Stunning visuals, Good looking cast, Great locations, Superb arieal fight scenes, Awesome Blu Ray picture & sound quality..Other than some great action, it covers Romance, Friendships & some more..pssst now thats for you to watch & find out!!"
positive,what would we do without death?: for all you fans of discworld out there this is another great product. you get with the mapp of death's domain a text book which explains what is the meaning of every part in the domain. in the text book we can learn what are death thoughts about golf and about getting lost in a garden maze. if you love death as much as i do you have got to buy this product.
positive,"Manson meets the Monkees: While I personally discount the rumor that this record was recorded not by ""Craig Smith"" but one George W. Bush during his acid/coke pagan stage these two discs give one plenty of room to project. A delightful mix of Buffalo Springfield like folk pop and a darker more morose Bread, not to mention the weird cut ups and studio nankering between songs. For those of you who wish you were old enough not to remember the sixties this is a good way to start."
negative,"Nothing like the authors other books: Having owned and enjoyed the authors other cookbooks, getting this one was an easy decision. The good reviews helped as well.After trying a few of the recipes, I call foul.Sauces with no thickening agent were runny, dressings were bland, and main entries that were just not palatable.I'll just tweak recipes from current cookbooks to make them low carb.Oh, and on a side note, it was interesting to note that on the authors web site, this title is not even mentioned among her many other, and delightful, books."
negative,"Interested in the great ship? Don't look here.: I've read many of the works published on the sinking of the White Star liner, Titanic, and I have to say this is, without doubt, one of the poorest yet. Pellegrino obviously is trying for emotional meditative discourse, but failing that, ends up making up out of whole cloth entire conversations and scenarios. Titanic was *not* the first ship to use the SOS call. The inclusion of the Frank Towers myth is a dead giveaway that Pellegrino picks and chooses his myths, without bothering with such inanities as fact-checking. If it's entertainment and an emotional response you're after, go see Cameron's movie. If it's history you want, better to stick with other, far better, far more accurate works."
positive,"Time to rock out with class!: Mountain takes the prize with this long awaited release. They unleash great pure rock tunes with energy like in the days of old. If you have been waiting for an all out heavy and hard sound with a solid performance by real musicians, you found it! They even throw it a killer tune with some strings just to keep you guessing. Some groups get better with time, but this group was great from the get-go. This proves they have never missed a beat! Well except on that one song, but only true fans no what I mean (and it was the best late entry in a tune ever!)"
positive,The key text.: Thisd just is the key text of 20th century philosophy. Written in aphoristic style and heavily reactive to the conversation between Frege Russell and the early Wittgenstein that gave birth to contemporary analytic philosophy it is a must read (in company with some of the texts from those three authors). Nobody should remain unchanged in their thinking by reading and striving to understand this work.
positive,"Wabash Standard Plans: I purchased this book for my husband after he saw it at a train show at a much higher price. He is an avid Wabash RR fan and collects what he can find on the Wabash, this book is mostly on specifications,plans, technical and reference material. He enjoyed receiving it and adding it to his collection."
positive,My son loved it!: My son loved this tent. I was able to put it together with relative ease. It has plenty of space inside and doesn't take up too much space. (He had it set up in his room) It is very durable. There were a dozen kids going in and out of the thing for months. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
negative,Doesn't hold a charge: This batter backup has been charging for days however cannot hold enough charge to even let a laptop run for 30 minutes. Very disappointed in this purchase.
positive,"Wonderful!!!: Wonderful book! Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books!"
positive,"I really liked it: I have to be honest, I bought the book because the writer was a teenager and I had to see what he might write!Regardless of age, I thought his book was extremely interesting and I even lost sleep to find out what happens next. I think you can see some inexperience in emotion in how some of the characters interact, but it definitely does not detract from one's enjoyment of the story.I definitely plan on purchasing the next book as it comes out. I have to find out how the rest of the story of Eragon and Saphira unfolds. So write, Christopher, write!"
positive,"Get Shirty!: I am a guy who wears formal shirt and tie to my office, so I have lots of shirts and I know a good shirt when I wear it.This was my first purchase of a Bill Blass Dress Shirt, so I did not quite know what to expect.Well I have now worn it a few times and it has been laundered and ironed and is still holding up well.I would recommend this shirt which I bought at an excellent price in a recent Amazon sale."
negative,"hmmm: not really worth it. it is the script for movie and the movie wasn't that goodwhy do you need to add a specific amount of words? less can be better, especially in a review"
negative,"It could have been better...: I saw this movie last night and was not too impressed. I'm not going to say it wasn't ""realistic,"" it's not meant to be. I mean, jeez, look at the game! I will say that I wish it had more in common with the game... too much was changed, in my opinion. Luigi is a young guy (with no moustache!), Toad is some kind of hippie, and the Goombas are shrunken-head dinos. I suppose most people would expect things to be more similar to the original, just like they'd expect a movie based on a book to be similar. I also got the impression that the writer/director really wasn't familiar with the game, maybe that's why there were so many changes. In any case, it is always tough to take a story from one media to another, and it seems to me that the efforts more often than not fall short of the mark."
positive,"YOU HAVE TO OWN IT NOW!: Don't spend time reading all the critics. If you're here, its because you have some interest in this particular movie. So, here's the deal: I'm from Mexico (and our humor it's a little different from yours), I'm not a fan of Beavis & Butthead neither King of the Hill, I dont know the Milton reference, I'm not in love with Jennifer Aniston and I only watch the movie once so many years before, but I have to own this movie now. Why? Cause I still cant' forget how great it is! pure and simple.Everything in there (story, characters, funny situations from beggining to end) is a hit. This is the kind of movie worth seeing 5 times a year (at least). Too bad the DVD has zero cool extras (an insult for the fans and the great movie that contains). Five stars for the movie, 3 for the DVD.Trust me: buy it, see it and enjoy it."
positive,"Right in the feels: George Orwell's oft referenced 1984 is a strikingly visual and visceral portrayal of life under a completely effective totalitarian regime. Orwell's use of adjectives to create a dank, despairing mood is beyond astonishing; I don't think I've ever read anything which approaches its power. He seems to criticize a government which resembles Nazi Germany in many ways, though I don't know exactly what he was aiming his literary ire at. Overall, an emotionally stabbing book which refuses to allow the reader any positive feelings toward powerful governments."
negative,baby oil maybe emu oil....not!: This oil feels like baby oil but more watery and oily. Total waste of money and did not sooth or heal my skin. I have never written a review but I really needed something to heal my skin and am so dissaponted I waited for such a poor product with awful quality and results. Do not buy!
negative,"Do not hear, do not obey...: If you have a mild to moderate gluten intolerance, you can MAYBE follow this book's advice and be safe. If you have full on Celiac Disease, you will find yourself sick in a single digestive cycle!Jax's information is lacking, out of date, and incorrect. I obsessively research foods, medicines, ingredients, and restraunts so as to be able to join my friends and family in their dinners, and my research shows Jax to be woefully incorrect. I'm encouraging my local booksellers to not carry this any more, and I encourage the discerning readers amoung you to take great care. If you want the feel good stories, read the feel good stores. Don't take the feel bad advice."
positive,"A very emotional book: I enjoyed this book and i think that most people would enjoy reading about the hardships, struggles, hopes and dreams of two men during the great depression. After reading this book I felt a greater appreciation for the people who lived during this time. The book was very inspirational tome. I loved how the book made you connect with the two characters, George and Lennie, and thier hopes for the future. This book was short in text but huhe in emotions and feelings of all the charchters. Although some times I will admit that the book exaggerated the sensitivity of the character Lennie the book was still good in the fact the plot made sense with a cast of realistic characters. The ending of the book is a real life ending that wasn't far fetched. They made the events believable which causedmany emotions to stir inside you anger, fear, suspense, sorrow, and happines just to name a few. You really connect with the book. That's why I highly recommend this book."
negative,great toy with one annoying problem..: we got this for our 5-months old daughter. she loves the sound of it but gets upset when the music stops playing. the sound shuts off automatically after 8 minutes and we have to turn it back on as she is still too young to hit the button herself. not sure why Fisher-Price wouldn't make it play longer.
positive,"Viva L'Italia!: I didn't know who Ana Bélen was. I was searching for singers singing Italian songs in the world in their language and have come across this record. I have appreciated this tribute to Italian singers such as Claudio Baglioni, Francesco De Gregori, Lucio Dalla, Modugno, Mina, Lucio Battisti, Fabio Concato and Gino Paoli. Ana's voice is both powerful and joyful and it's been able to touch my soul. I like the way she plays these songs. I hope that she means to record a ""Viva l'Italia Vol.2"" because Italy is full of beautiful songs. Hearing them in Spanish is charming for me because Italian and Spanish are somehow similiar. Brava Ana!"
negative,"BORING!: The subject matter is fascinating and has the potential to make an exciting, fast moving read. Unfortunately the presentation is disorganized, repetetive and BORING. I had to force myself to finish the thing and ended up wondering what the heck the point was meant to be. I certainly didn't feel that I had acquired any clear understanding of what happened in Point Pleasant; I didn't even get enough out of it to decide whether I believe any of the stories or not. If you want the book, borrow it from someone and save your money."
positive,"Critics hyped it up WAY too much: The album is good, but the critics really overhyped this album into some sort of time-altering masterpiece. Nevertheless, I'm still proud of Lauryn Hill for receiving tons of praise (even though it could've been given to more notable R&B/Hip Hop superstars)."
negative,"not very good: i don't remember this movie, so i know it was bad. i probably did not watch the whole thing. bad production, bad acting"
negative,TERRIBLE: This product last maybe a week before it broke. Would not do more then 2 or 3 coins at a time. It is easier to sort the coins by hand!!!
positive,"So Cool!: This CD is great! It's lyrics, sound, and beat make it a much better choice than Oops! I did it again! or Christina Agulara! This CD is suitable for all ages! But, because of the message behind certain songs such as ""Dear Friend"" and ""Everything I Have"" it would do a lot more good for Junior High and High School age groups! Make sure you listen to the track ""Stay True"""
positive,"Quest for Fire: It was good to see the movie after all these years. I remembered it as being funny, and it still held up. My friends have borrowed it since, and all liked it."
positive,"Quality: This is a quality product. Brio puts out a great wooden train track. They are wooden, well made and have held up to many years of use at our home.The more different sizes and items you have for your track the more your track can change from a simple circle to a large fun track. We have several sets of these to play with at our home.I would probably buy these after I have bought some of the extension kits with the more specialized track pieces and after I had some of the smaller pieces available for purchase.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
negative,"Don't waste your money on this one!: While this DVD will, in fact, be playable on a computer or a Region 1 player, the image quality is very poor. Scenes shot outdoors will be washed out and overexposed, and any rapid on-screen motion will cause the image to blur perceptibly. This gets worse as the film progresses. I got suckered into buying this clinker before warnings about the difference in regions were posted prominently. However, I don't believe incompatibility entirely accounts for the poor performance of this product: it looks and behaves like a poorly-executed copy of a copy made by a company that is not equipped (or doesn't care enough) to produce a high-quality DVD."
negative,"First ""King"" book I regret buying!: I have been reading Stephen King books since discovering ""The Stand"" at the age of 14. (over 20 years now) But this is the first one that I would even consider returning. I kept thinking that it would get better and it never did. While there were some good parts, there were certainly not enough. I just hope that this was a result of too much time since the last book and the ol' writing skills were a little rusty. I look forwarded to the next one. Everyone deserves a second chance."
negative,"Would have been nice except all the bugs!: This game could have been a nice RPG game.However, the large number of bugs makes the game unbearable.I've seen many computer games, and this takes the cakefor the number of errors, glitches, freezes, bugs...Save your money."
positive,"great for dandruff and split ends.: i mix this with shea butter and castor oil and apply it to my scalp twice a week. i cover my head with a plastic cap for deep penetration.now i see no dandruff at all and all my split ends are gone!i do have a funny-smelling urine, but i think that's because i don't drink enough water."
negative,"Disables Itself on Users' Computers: McAfee has been trying for over three months to resolve various problems with the product disabling itself on users' computers.With an anti-virus product, of course, that's about as bad a bug as you can get.In my case, the product disables itself every time I use Roxio's Drag-to-Disc.The forums at McAfee are full of different instances of this same problem."
positive,"Cheaper elsewhere: This is a great movie and worth any price however, I was at a Best Buy store recently and paid $5.99 plus tax. (BTY: it was not on sale but instead the everyday low price.)"
negative,"awful: I just gave this to my 3 year old for her birthday tonight. She was so excited about her ""baby alligator"" but when I tried to show her that it was a game, I couldn't make it work. I tried 6 times and ONE of the times I pushed all the teeth in and got it to snap closed. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
positive,"Caribes: I haven't actually read Cienfuegos - yet. However, I purchased Caribes via the internet purely because I had been recommended the author and did not realize until I received it that it was the second of a series. Today I was looking for the third in the series - Azabache as I simply have to find out what happens to Cienfuegos next! Caribes is the first spanish book I have read cover to cover and I can't wait to get hold of the next . Great characterization. Vasquez - Figueroa certainly has a vivid imagination which constantly surprises you while instilling a sense of history about the conquest of the New World. Please, please please can Amazon get in ALL of the books in this series as well as Tuareg and Yaiza which I have also been highly recommended (untranslated)"
positive,"Required reading in these fictitious times: No novel seems to be more relevant these days than George Orwell's 1984. While the year has passed the ideas of trickery and deception by the government still exist. Oceania could easily be the United States and Big Brother could be any one of the three letter orginizations in the US. No there arent telescreens everywhere, but thanks to the deceptivly titled ""Patriot Act"" Orwells nightmare is eerily closer to reality than ever before. Read this book. Period."
positive,"Great book, in a great size!!: I love Jules Verne's writing. This book is small enough to fit in a purse or glove box so you can take it with you anywhere. If you like steampunk fiction, or old west, read some Jules Verne"
negative,"arghh: let it be over please! snore fest! if you are interested in wars and action, not the book for you. if you want a love plot, this one is flismy and sad. we had to read this book for LA (and maybe it was my stupid teaches monotone voice or her many worksheets) and i found this book very easy to fall asleep during. i am one of those people who ca enjoy any book and this one was ok, ill give it that, but it wasnt a recomendation by any kind. if you want to learn about the revolution watch the patriot instead....much more interesting."
negative,"Poor quality product: The idea around this board game is a good one--to make it cooperative. The picture on the board itself is a colorful and fun graphic. However, the quality of the product is very poor. The game pieces are on such thin paper and so tiny it is difficult to pick them up. It is VERY over priced for the quality of the product. Should be more like $5. Peaceable Kingdoms game, Stone Soup, is $10 instead of $15 and the quality is superb."
negative,"no better than DVD: instead of taking their time and doing the job right.. .they did a quick rush job to get it on shelves... i was looking for the whole super fly home theatre experience, and this just bombed."
negative,"bad history. bad costumes. just plain bad.: This is one of the worst movies to come out in years. The history is appallingly bad. It's down right offensive to anyone who knows anything at all about the Roman Empire. The costumes (which won an Oscar!) are even worse (note that the emperor's sister is wearing a Victorian corset, complete with busk, over a sari in one scene!). It's criminal that Hollywood gets away with such travesties, and is rewarded with praise and adulation for them, especially when these so called ""historical"" movies end up in our children's classrooms as study aids. Why can't the entertainment industry spend the extra five minutes to check their history, or hire a consultant? The ONLY reason to see this film is if you're a die-hard Russell Crowe fan (and even then in falls into the same group as the quick and the dead: Watch the Russell scenes, and fast forward through the rest)."
positive,"Careful which blu-ray you get: All the negative comments you've seen about the first blu-ray release for Sept 2009 are true. Horrible transfer but they fixed all the problems with the August 2010 release. All the arrows, crisp colors, etc are there.Now trying to figure out which blu ray is which is the difficult part as the box, from what I can see, looks the same. I don't know if you are going to be able to get it right going through Amazon. No offense to them as I love the company but the only release I see that they are offering is the 2009 edition. It looks like the 2009 edition is known as the first press and the 2010 edition is known as the remastered edition. blu-ray dott comm has a more extensive review of the better copy if you are looking for specifics.The makers that be screwed this up big time as I avoided the blu-ray edition like the plague until someone pointed out to me that the true blu-ray for Gladiator was released in August 2010."
negative,"Maybe next time: I've been reading nearly constantly since I was 5 years old and am now 50, so I feel I have some basis of comparison for books I read. It seems I'll be in the minority in the reviews of this book but I found it difficult to read, quite easy to put down (though I determinedly slogged through it), with characters who were maddening and an ending that was, as others have noted, a disappointment. The writing - turns of phrase and so forth - however, showed real skill and I think Ms. Hunter will someday write a very good book. This just wasn't it.If the other reviewers have been truthful and this book gets them reading others, than a public service has been done and thanks to Ms. Hunter for helping create new readers."
negative,"The editors should be shot: The editors of this film should be shot. No shot lasts more than 3 seconds. On a big screen tv it's dizzing. It's too bad since the film on a whole is a pretty good film, and the music is pretty great. But the film is ruined by fast cutting and quick shots - was the editing team on speed???????? Why do they think this is the way to edit a musical? If you become aware of the editing while you're watching a film, then the editors have done a bad job. Hire editors who know how to edit a film, skip the Blu-ray and by the CD."
positive,Another Rohnke Winner!: This is another Karl Rohnke winner. If you work with experiential learning (either with kids or adults) this is a great book to have in your library. This book contains a lot of old activities as well as some new ones. As with a lot of experiential activities -- it's great to have the procedure written out. This book is well worth the price.
negative,"only works within 10 feet of the access point: my AM radio has more sensitivity then this unit. at 25 feet away from the wap it noticed that there was one, but the signal strength was 0%. at 10 feet from the wap i was able to get a working signal strength of 50%. compared to my smc wireless pc card this usb device is useless. so back it goes"
positive,"a good concert by kd and a well put together dvd: kd lang's voice sounds great in this concert dvd. The song selection ranges from some of her earliest to her most recent, as well as little bits of some she has not officially recorded (MacArthur Park). The band and background singers are great and seem to be having a good time, as does kd. While it's obvious from listening to kd sing that she is a great interpreter of songs, particularly sad songs, watching her sing truly reveals how ""into"" the lyrics she gets as she sings. I can never keep my eyes dry when I hear or see kd sing ""Crying."" The surround mixing is well done, and the disc offers both DTS and DD 5.1 mixes in addition to a standard stereo track. The camera-work and lighting are good. Highly recommended."
positive,"A Wonderful Classic: Alcott's 'Little Women' is delightful and heartwarming, ever since I started reading it at 10 years old. The novel never fails to show me how we all make mistakes, we all fail, and we all triumph. Some of my friends have told me the book is boring, slow-paced, and idealistic. Little Women is simply about a family facing trials during the Civil War, and every chapter presents a fresh situation with a good deal of humor too. Alcott's style allows you to feel you are one of the March family, and her development of all characters is fantastic. Her details and dialogue allow the story to flow smoothly, and I've learned a lot from this great piece of American literature. I never tire of reading Little Women. It's that wonderful."
positive,"Very good writing, buy not for me: I just finished reading this book in my 8th grade English class. Golding is a fantastic writer, but the book was not my type. There were to many gory detales, but it really made me think. I would recommand this book to anyone who likes to really think about what they read."
positive,"this is a grand soundtrack: in response to the one guys response about the soundtrack being dull and boring and the movie being good and exciting, i say this: the music made the movie. it is a glorius triumph of sound never yet heard on this great earth of ours. perhaps you should have fallen asleep to this soundtrack in your car that day, maybe you would have bumped your head on the dash and realized how magnificent the music that made the movie is. peace and love to all my brethren."
positive,We loved it!: My family watched the movie and loved it. It was exactly what we were looking for.....John Cena action flick to escape reality for a little while. Can't wait til his new movie comes out in March.
negative,"cheap cheap cheap...: I fell in love with the print on a set of 250 thread count Tommy Hilfiger sheets, so I bought two sets of twin size at $15.99 for each sheet. I also bought two packages of pillow cases, the comforter, two shams and a valance to match. What a big mistake. It was a total waste of money and I will never buy anything from Tommy Hilfiger again. The seams on the sheets (BOTH top and bottom) started unravelling after only THREE washes. The elastic on the bottom sheet came unsewn. I took the second set of sheets out thinking maybe it was just a freak thing that I got two bad sheets. The same thing happened with the second set. Also, the quilting on the comforter came completely unravelled after a couple weeks. The fabric of the sheets faded SO fast and they looked like I had had them for years. I will *never* spend my hard earned money on the Tommy Hilfiger brand name again. They are expensive to buy but are very cheaply made and fall apart right away. What a waste."
negative,"Skip the quartet, and go for the whole orchestra.: This is one of those albums I wish I hadn't paid for. It's an interesting curiosity for the REM fan, but I find it nearly un-listenable. The arrangements simply destroy most of the REM sound. My advice: pass this one by, and pick up the disc from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra."
positive,"Excitement for your bookshelf!: Growing up in the March house is no easy task. Four girls growing up during the Civl War was hard for tomboyish Jo, gentle Beth, helpful Meg and exciting Amy. When they meet their wealthy nieghbor, Laurie, life becomes anything but boring. They go through spring days and trials together. As the sisters go from girlhood to womenhood, they find their selves going through life changes they never imagined they would go through. So dive into the wonderful adventures of ""Little Women"" as they learn life changing lessons."
positive,"Bierce's command of the language is stunning.: To anyone interested in the English language and its application by a master story teller, this author must be read. Bierce is an American wit equal to (and contemporary of) Mark Twain, and he writes not with a pen dipped in ink but with a scalple dipped in bile. Prepare to be scathed."
negative,"the other reviewer is right: Unfortunately, there is a major problem with the sound on this album and it's so bad that it makes this album unacceptable and a waste of your money. What a shame! Although I can clearly tell there was nothing wrong with Eddie Fisher's performance of this set of songs; the sound quality (and probably the mastering) of these tracks is every bit as poor as the other reviewer states that it is.Therefore, I would recommend one of two alternatives. Diehard Eddie Fisher fans will probably want both! First, there is the very good (even though it's currently out of print) CD entitled ""Songs for Christmas"" by Eddie Fisher which has two bonus tracks by Frankie Laine. Second, there is the CD that contains the music from three of Eddie's record albums entitled ""Eddie Fisher Sings;"" ""I'm in the Mood for Love"" and ""Christmas with Eddie Fisher."" In short, you'll be much better off with one or even both of these two other albums."
positive,"Steven Wilson is GOD!: Absolutely, mind-blowingly awesome! Steven Wilson is the master of multi-channel sound production. Only HE could put together a disc that can (almost) capture the experience of a Porcupine Tree concert. Not to be missed!"
positive,"good mystery spanning decades: I first saw this miniseries as a teenager and still remember it. My dad and I loved it and found it on Amazon! thank you! If you like mysteries and police work, you should like this. Bear in mind it's dated so it doesn't have the type of production we are used to today, but it was fun to see Wayne Rogers and others. (Wayne Rogers' part isn't very long---only one or two episodes??) The mystery and the way the story weaves is good. Hope you enjoy."
negative,"Junk: This film tried to capitalized on the previously successful Legend of Boggy Creek, and failed horribly. It's nothing but a boring home movie. Other than a shot of someone prancing around a forest in a gorilla suit, the film has no perks whatsoever. Strongly not recommended."
positive,"great shoes: We bought these for my daughter to start school. They are classic, cool and don't cost a fortune. The conversion from men's to women's sizes was accurate. They hold up much better than knock-offs of the same style. Also Amazon makes things so easy, my mother wanted to get my daughter something to start school & didn't have time to shop. I went to my daughter's wish list & because I have shopped Amazon for my mother before I had all her information. I was done in 3 minutes."
positive,"wild and crazy: I ordered the movie because it was done by my classmates....Mt. Diablo High School class of l957 gary espinosa, and carol bigby are classmates....and the area is where I grew up...... thought it was good.... and enjoyed Jack nicholson as ayoung actor. a. hengel"
negative,This book wasn't near as good as the others: Gillian came off as a wimp. Angel was ok. They should have made Gillian seem more like a real girl and not someone from a soap opera.
negative,"Grainy image: I can't resist writing a review, because I rely heavily on what others have to say too.I just bought the 1115 and it's being returned today. I've had an Epson Photostylus 870 for the past couple of years and had a little ink mis-hap (my fault) and thought, what the heck I'll get a new printer figuring the technology has improved, etc. This time I decided to go with an HP because I generally like their products, but I'm going back to an Epson.The quality of photo prints are not even comparable. The Epson prints are clear, crisp and realistic. The HP prints (even at 2400dpi) are grainy and fuzzy.Not to mention that ever since I installed the printer (using USB) my floppy disk drive has been grinding every few minutes. Not sure what's up with that.I will say that the HP is fast and fairly quiet. Printing regular documents on paper of course looks nice, but for ""real"" photo images try Epson.Good luck!"
negative,Weights fall off with swimming motion: I lost the weights the second day of use. Bottom line the motion of the water as you swim unscrews the weights from the camera body. Save your money on this one.
negative,"Not His Best Effort: Unlike the other volumes in the Spellsong series, I felt the characters in Darksong Rising were predictable and offered no depth. It seemed that Anna is faced with the same issues she faced in the last book. The villains are all one dimensional, power hungry, bigoted males. While these characters no doubt deserve their punishments, I would not want to read about them over and over again. This book was a disappointment."
positive,"WOW!: Oh. My. God. This is an AMAZING book. Can't wait to read the 2nd. This is a really, really, really, REALLY god book. I loved it."
positive,"A great book: The messages in this book are poisitive indeed. They show how our environment, thoughts and feelings affect life, water, and the basis of the research shows how your thoughts and feelings effect you. It is an interesting read!"
positive,"Stellar outing: I'm very impressed with this outing by Kid Loco. One of the better DJKicks out there,just flows one song into another."
positive,I love my card holders: It makes so much easier to hold my cards and my friends like them very much. Thanks for selling this product.
negative,"Don't waste your money ...: I agree that if you read the reviews on the back of the back you could understand the whole book without even reading a page.If you read this book and feel you need to break down your customers to the agonizing details that she has developed, I feel sorry for your investors. There is no way for a company that follows her advice to become or remain profitable. The only conclusion would be that you need her consulting services because there's no way you could do it yourself.Don't waste your time and money reading this book."
positive,too much fun: A well told story of taking the alternative route. Great cast all around.How can you lose with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn?
negative,"Bland pop crossed with Broadway wannabe: While I love a few tracks on this CD and admire the writers and producers involved (Darren Hayes, Desmond Child, Cathy Dennis, Danielle Brisbois, Aldo Nova), almost every song sounds the same. And Clay has this annoying habit of ""finishing"" each and every song as if it were performed live. Maybe it's just me but I kind of like (or am used to) fade outs in pop songs. I definetly like Clay's voice and there are standout songs that actually effected me (the title track especially moved me) but I have to say Kelly Clarkson's debut CD is head and shoulders a better produced collection than this middle of the road, unoffensive, generic collection of milquetoast. I expected more from Clay after his first single. Better luck next time."
positive,"If you're a student of the first air war...you'll love this.: Super sound and visuals bring WWI air combat to life. For 90 years, the story of the first aces & fighter-planes has been limited to our imaginations, grainy pictures and mediocre films. Based on a true story with plenty of artistic license, Flyboys is fun to watch. An enjoyable story that puts the moviegoer in the cockpit. After watching this, you'll respect those Flyboys and be glad you weren't in the cockpit! The DVD is crisp, the audio great, the flying scenes spectacular, the story good."
positive,"A Good Movie: I went to see this movie twice and each time it got better. This was better than the first one and had better graphics. The only things I didn't like about the movie were those little creatures that were in the woods, the ones that shot the blow darts at the people. It looked too much at first like Jarassic Park, when the Raptors took the people under the weeds in the second one. It just looked really bad. My friend and I were laughing throughout that part! The only other part I didn't like was when The Rock came out at the end as the Squirpion King (I don't know how to spell it LOL). It just looked so fake!"
positive,"Gillette Fusion Manual: These are good razors and a grate value, but there just not very good on my neck gives me bad razor burn other than that they are grate..."
negative,"Awful: I dozed off part way through the film and then after watching another ten minutes just turned off the DVD player. The film seems to be aiming to be a comedy, but fails utterly. It can not be anything else except for a very weak (dark) comedy."
negative,Rotten Batteries: After a few months use the batteries quit charging. Good concept but lousy product. A waste of your money.
positive,Great Addition to my collection: Just having- RAIN FALL DOWN is worth buying.2nd Fav would be the bluesy- BACK of My Hand...guess I'm a bit sappy but I liked- This Place is Empty.This CD still Rocks My World! Enjoy.
negative,"Hate to Say It: I Didn't find Bely's ""Masterpiece"" Any Good: I'm sorry, but I apparently disagree with Nabokov. While an interesting read, ""Petersburg"" is confusing to the point of absurdity (not in a good way) and ultimately not very enlighting. When thought of in the context of the Revolution of 1905, Bely's occult beliefs, etc., the novel is slightly more interesting but still not worth the time and mental effort required to read it. Some might say I'm missing something, but I would say their looking too hard. You'd be better off actually reading ""Ulysses"" or, if you want some Russian, ""Brothers Karamazov"" or some Chekhov."
positive,"All episodes are there: I just watched season 3 and despite what the previous reviewer said, all of the episodes are there.Oh, and the show is very good. It's a bit emotionally draining if you watch them all in a row, but all the best shows are!"
negative,"Comment on DVD format; not movie: I will leave a review of the movie to other (although I thought it was great) and will comment only on the format of the DVD.I think this is the worst DVD I have bought in terms of format. Not only when you select play movie does the the movie not play, you have to skip through several pre-movie talks and coming soons. You will eventually get to the start of the movie but you can't just press one button to play. I hope this trend will not continue, but no expectations.Other than this annoyance the DVD plays great."
positive,"Nine Days Rocks!: Not only is this a true rock CD, but I have been so tired of ""boy bands"" that don't even play an instrument. I had the pleasure of seeing Nine Days live at my University and they have all the talent and energy needed to pull off an awsome concert! They are loud! I hope they keep up this style of music and do so much more!"
positive,"New Technology!: This is new technology, what can we say? It might have its occasional bugs (not being able to get songs in a few days) but these are things that can be overlooked. Its new for crying out loud! The best way to get these bugs ironed out is by supporting the product and giving Sony feedback. The interface of this product is excellent and simple...a button and a tiny LCD screen. If you don't know how to use this then...technology isn't your buddy I guess. As far as coverage and the speed in which certain radio stations provide feedback is the sole responsiblity of that station for the most part (most stations take 24 hours to get a song. others might take maybe 10 minutes or so), and NPR support would be very much appreciated. Not every location on the surface of the earth is supported (yet) but as far as I'm concerned an e-mail request to Sony could help to do the trick. Overall, the product is great and it is a great Sony investment."
positive,"not fully assimilated: Roemer takes a look at the Jewish community in Germany of the 19th century. Challenging a common assertion that the community are fully assimilated and largely secular. Instead, he found that due in part to persistent discrimination and exclusion early in that century, many Jews formed parallel associations. This arose in the occupational and social contexts. Plus also educational, as several universities refused to admit Jews.Some of the Jewish organisations were of a strongly religious nature, and looked to a lengthy Jewish history for inspiration and for recruiting members.The book delves into documenting numerous Jewish groups that flourished during these years. Not all religious. Some were quite secular. Their achievements were impressive, reflecting a people that, while not fully assimilated, felt secure and accomplished."
positive,"At first I loved it. Now I LOVE it.: I'm a long-time fan and this brings great new versions of his material and great covers of others. My only complaint is that some tracks are too short. Summer in the City, Mood Indigo and King of the World shine.NOTE: I'm not much of a Live album fan but speaking as someone who has everything he's done this is J.J.s best."
negative,"Heavy and Stiff: I'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price. I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these. The boots were fairly heavy, stiff and narrow. I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me. I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable, flexible and light with good sole traction."
positive,Perfect: Received the product very promptly. The item works perfectly. I received exactly what the ad described.
negative,"Poor quality control: I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect. After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV, I purchased a pair with high expectations. However, my first pair had a defect in the left shoe. It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt. At first, I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots. However, it did not help, and my foot continued to hurt. Today, I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size, and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion. I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all, my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold. 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control."
positive,"Here Kitty, Kitty: I really like the three psycho, female characters in this series, the interaction between them is just so frighteningly, hilarious. The main focus of this book is Angie's kidnapping, her evolving relationship with Nick and the importance of family. I was satisfied with the pace of their relationship; Angie is defiantly her own person and doesn't do anything she doesn't want to. I loved how well Angie got on with Nick's close nit family, including his Grandma and how Nick understood Angie's relationship with her two best friends 'the crazy women'.Who knew a toilet could be used as a weapon?"
positive,"Great item but very tight fit: This item was perfect to replace my old worn out pad, only bit is its a very tight fit (no complaints to that as it means it won't move or fall off) but have a screwdriver within reach to help get that final corner on to the brake pedal."
negative,"1/4 to 3/8 is not usable: I made the purchase because of the multiple languages involved, but it is really not a multilingual dictionary. Well, there are 8 sections with different primary language entries, but unfortunately, as a native Chinese speaker and a student in linguistic field, I cannot figure out the way the Chinese words are organized, neither by pronunciation nor stroke number. For example, in the Chinese section, ther first word is ""juji"" (to gather), the second one is ""ju-zhi-xianwei"" (polyester), and the third one is ""tui"" (leg). I don't see any logic in this sequencing, linguistically or realistically. There is no instructions explaining this works. So, there is no way for me to use this dictionary. Judging from my limited Japanese knowledge, the Japanese words are not arranged in alphabetical order either. If this is also true for the Korean section, 3/8 of this book is not usable."
negative,"Santana, All That I Am: Sorry, I was so disappointed! It was a bore, Let down like a kid on Christmas day!"
positive,"Wonderful and Dramatic: Basically, Rashel is searching for the vampire who killed her family when she was a child. She comes upon an enclave of vampires, and, ironically, falls in love with one. His name is Quinn. He is also the fosterling of the vampire who killed Rashel's family.Well written and suspensefu"
positive,"An excellent story!: Barbara Trapido writes beautifully. I have read all her books, but this one is my favorite. The characters are real and loveable"
negative,Boring but had many details: I thought this book was very boring. I was only fascinated with the details of the cases. I think it was poorly written.
negative,"Good idea, but badly executed.: It was a good idea to skip the Michael Myers storyline for a minute, but come on. Magic masks that make people's heads explode, can't they think of a better idea than that? What a waste of time. If they are going to abandon the Micheal Myers storyline, can they at least come up with a more creative storyline.P.S. the only reason that I am giving this movie two stars is because it is slightly better than sequels 4, 5, 6, and 8."
positive,"Fast paced sequel, great additon to wilderness series!: This sequel to Into the Wilderness was fast paced and adventurous, but somewhow found time for us readers to see a bit more of the characters. (A deeper view) I kept turning the pages wanting more, and was rewarded. When all is said and done with this series, this book in paticular will have a special place with me. It's a delight!"
positive,"The first blockbuster application for OS X version 10.1!: I'm basing this review on the word X test Driver version, available on the Microsoft matopia site. From what I've seen so far, this is one very good app--everything has been made to work with the Aqua interface, the layout is quite easy to learn and use quickly, and I find myself using it more and more everyday. Of course, in the Test Drive doesn't have all of the features included--you can use the project gallery for the basics, but you'll have to wait for printing to be enabled, for example. The best part--when I redid my resume and send it as an attachment, I don't hear the old ""resend it as a Word doc!"" complaint anymore. I'll upgrade to Word X for sure!"
negative,Another crappy rush job!: This whole film is just too rushed and it left out too much story from the wonderful book and it keeps the continuity errors from the third film. It and the third film only deserve one star for some good acting. My suggestion is that you stick with the book series and the first two films.
positive,George is Da Man!: Love the Destroyers. Have been a fan since their 1st albumn. Great blues and rock & roll from one of the few still carrying the flame.
negative,I never ordered this: I don't understand why this Gillette Fusion 12 count manual razor was shipped to me because i don't believe I ever ordered it. Regardless i did not want it. This item is currently available from Costco
negative,"My 6yr old brother could write better than this!: I am twelve years old, and have written three fantasy books. I will admit, that the first one I wrote, was based off Tolkien, and inspired by him.But this, peice of crap? It was copied from Tolkien. Pathetic! It is filled with too many pointless descriptions that come out of the blue, only to drag you away from the rocky plot. It is barely a story, mostly descriptions, and the names are all tears away from Tolkien as well.Ayra:ArwenEragon: This is /too/ obvious.And Brom is obviously molded from Gandalf.The boy, is way to unoriganal and acts like he's fourty! Everything that happens is very stereotypcial, and I had to force myself to finish it. All that happens: He gets hurt, he gets better. I could guess what was going to happen next, everything was just a cheap twist from either Star Wars or Tolkien, so in closing:DOWN WITH CRAPPY FANTASY!"
positive,"An Audiophile Recording: Rounder has done a great job with this recording. Very natural sounding with dynamics that are a godsend to an audiophile. This recording rocks. Johnny is so good on this album. His phrasing is just impeccible. And the Dr.'s hammond, oh my, way cool. The other reviewrs are spot on this is greatness. You want to show off how good your stereo is, get this cd."
negative,False: I'm am an absolute fanatic of the greatest ship ever built.(in my opinion)And this book was very in accurate. The authors didn't really focus on what really happened. If I were a critic I'd give it... two thumbs WAY DOWN!
negative,"smells horrible: Bought this product to help with hives and some foot issues however this stuff smell horrible kinda like something a hospital would use I could barely use it once, as for as effectiveness nothing has changed however I only used it once."
negative,"Not the shoe in the picture: I ordered this shoe and it took over 2 weeks to get, when it finally arrived it is not the actual shoe that they are showing in the picture. Very disappointing! The shoe does fit true to your size, I ordered a 1/2 size bigger and it is too big. I was planning to return the shoe anyway, since I did not get what I thought I ordered."
positive,One Tree Hill Season 7: This product was delivered at a reasonable amount of time considering it was international.Package was not damaged in the slightest and ive enjoyed watching every second of this season as it has not yet been released on DVD in Aus yet.Good work!
negative,"Great in theory....horrible in execution: They had a great idea with this film (despite clearly borrowing the concept from ""Hostel"")...a group of stranded tourists in Brazil are drugged and robbed and left with no alternative but to follow a ""friend"" into the jungle, ostensibly to have their organs sold on the black market, unbeknownst to them.What failed was just about everything from the horrible acting, to the gratuitous bikini-clad ""Hostel"" wanna-bees, to the implausibility of their situation and the fact that a horror film should actually be scary. Unfortunately, what could have been an interesting and scary film was just plain dumb!I would NOT recommend renting this movie (or even watching it for free once it comes to Cable), let alone paying money for it. If you like the idea behind the film, ""Hostel"" is a much better take on the could-it-really-happen-to-me-as-a-traveler-in-a-foreign-country horror film."
positive,"Tiesto delivers!: After still being blown away by ISOS3 everytime I hear it, I was more than ready for ISOS4. It does not dissapoint as it is a chill voyage through trance. I have to agree with an earlier reviewer that it doesn't have many peaks...it just is kind of stable the whole way. ""Do What U Want"" and the ten minutes that follow are simply incredible. Disc 1 and Disc 2 sound for the most part alike, but I like them both so no problem with me. 4 out of 5 with the only ding being that it is not ISOS3...the greatest ever."
positive,Classic Alabama: Alabama and gospel -- You've got to hear Randy Owens sing Will the Circle Be Unbroken with guest vocalists Del and Ron McCoury.
negative,"Terrible Mac support...: Terrible Mac support...Mac's must use Internet Exlorer to access many links... unavailabe after January 31, 2006,according to my research..."
negative,"They are no different from secular bands: These guys look and perform just like secular bands. They dress and look like them, with all the tattoos and shirts and hats with skulls/demons on them. I used to like them until I found out that they want to merge secular music with Christian music.You shall not make any cuts on your body for the dead or tattoo yourselves: I am the Lord. Lev 19:28You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 1Cor. 10.21You must distinguish between the holy and the profane, between the unclean and the clean. Lev 10.10Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. Eph 5.11For more info, check out EX ministries' ""Truth Behind Rock n Roll"" DVD:http://www.exministries.com/tbr&r;.html"
positive,"outstanding! bit pricey at amazon...: I love this rice cooker, it lets me eat rice whenever I want, with its timer settings. Not only that, it has appropriate cooking settings - perfect for any kind of rice cooking. I personally like semi-brown rice, so I just put rice in, set the timer for 7am night before, then eat the rice all day for all my meals.I also saw this rice cooker at 99 Ranch market for 120 dollars so maybe it's a better deal than Amazon. I got 25 off for this from amazon but if you can get to 99 ranch, get it there instead if you can find it."
positive,"between the fence and the universe: This is a solid EP. Criticizm towards Kevin Max regarding whether or not he's still a Christian, and towards his music is ridiculous to me. The beauty of Kevin's music is that he doesn't put his message right out there in the open.DC Talk breaking up was the best thing that ever happened to Kevin Max. TobyMac is a travesty to music and christianity. And tait is mediocre at best. Kevin Max plays real music. He plays with real emotion and sings about real life things. If you're a christian who can't handle that, then please go listen to Toby Mac talk about what a huge party christianity is.We should all be thanking people like kevin max for bringing some legitimacy back into Christian music, not bashing him for doing so."
negative,dumb & dumber: I didn't like the video. How could all Joseph's brothers be of a different race? Are we trying to be politically correct or WHAT? Also I wish Donny had kept his shirt on. I was turned on by his hairy chest. I have seen this performed twice by groups other than Donny and co. and enjoyed it so much more. Give it up Donny!!
positive,simple quick fix: I bought this product to slim my waist and I really didn't have big expectations for it at all. I figured I'd wear it under my clothes for a more defined shape. I've been wearing it for a month already and I've seen my waist go down 2 inches! I wear it all day at work from 7:00 till about 3:00. It fit snug in the beginning but after one week I had to go to the tighter hooks and even that is too big now and I may need to buy a small. I actually like wearing it but I recommend wearing a tank top under it because it will start to press into your skin and kind of make you sore ( hence the 4 star rating). I'm very happy with this product for the price. It works better than Spanx.
positive,"2 on-off cycles 20 amp T-slot type outlet: As described, it works, should work for a while. Can be manually switched to the opposite cycle (on /off) but only until timer trips it again. Very bare-bones but if you want 20 amp or the T-slot this is it."
positive,"a fun movie: My wife and I were big fans of the first 2 movies, which were very close to the book. The third movie, which was a little loose with the book story, wasn't our favorite. We were worried about this one, but we were very pleasantly surprised by it! It was good fun and had just about everything we'd hoped for."
positive,"Inspirational guide for balancing your life.: Draws upon the Tao Te Ching and the practice of aikido to illustrate a balanced approach to life. Includes chapters on transforming challenge and conflict into harmony, respecting the natural cycles of life, and overcoming feelings of powerlessness in order to find a more active, powerful approach to life. I've been curious about the martial arts and really enjoyed the parallels the author makes between spiritual growth and aikido. Gave me a new perspective on the issue of balance."
negative,"Wrong DVD. Huge FAIL: I got the ""Mortal Kombat"" case but the ""Last Tango in Paris"" DVD. I didn't bother to return because I don't have time to ship it back but I am very displeased."
negative,"Julie is a whiner who doesn't like to cook!: I only read 2/3 of this ""memoir."" Before reading I was intrigued by the concept - the author cooking the recipes of Julia Child. Sounds like potential for amusement. I agree with many of the negative reviews below that this is a self-absorbed, whiney author. I found each chapter repetitive - drinking her gimlets, not having sex with her husband, her try-too-hard-to-be-eccentric friends. This book is a case in point that a popular-blog-does-not-a well-written, well-conceived-book-make. I would recommend Ruth Reichl's memoirs or Peter Mayle's tales of French food and experiences. Or Julia Child's ""My Life in France"" (haven't read that one, but it has *got* to be better than this.) This book is a poor choice for a reader, a foodie or anyone who abhors whining."
positive,"I loved it!!: It was a magnificent portrait of a real man, a delightful combination of myth, magic and humanity that made it clear how all Ireland fell under his spell."
negative,The price was good but it cost more to ship it that the cost of the item.: I am not satisfied with this product. When i loaded it on my cpu I loaded the label part first. When I attempted to load the print shop portion the program stopped working and locked my computer up. I finally had to unplug the cpu and re-power it up to get it running again. I removed the Printshop version and tried to remove the Label portion but could not. When I tried to do some labels on the program I found it to be more complicated that it should have been. I spoke to a friend and she said she had the same problem with Printshop and it took her son-in-law five days to fix the problem.
negative,"It AIN'T all that!: I bought this book based on the reviews I read here, but if I could do it over, I would <b>NOT</b> buy this book.Issue #1This book has A LOT of errors. The author's website dismisses all the mistakes by saying, ""All printed material has mistakes."" First, I doubt that ""all"" have mistakes. Second, this book has A LOT of mistakes. I have many books and this one has the most errors. I went to their site to get the errata and found a mistake in their corrections!Issue #2The CD that comes with the book is quirky and it's not easy to find all stuff that's supposed to be on it.Issue #3Now that LearnKey is defunct, you cannot get a code to unlock the rest of the info on the CD. Instead, the autor's site charges for a new, unlocked CD.Go for another, more reliable book! Unless you enjoy wasting money for misinformation."
negative,Threw it away: This was a waste of a few dollars. I literally threw it away within a minute of opening the package and looking at it.
positive,"Hang in there, it's worth it.: Yes, much of this novel is slow going, but the characters have a complex authenticity sometimes absent from the ""marriage as ideal"" type of narratives. I admit I had to quit a few times and read other books before finishing this, but it was worth it. The last paragraph is gorgeous."
positive,excellent diabetes guide: This book has solved the problems we had while trying to manage my son's diabetes.You can find all answers in diabetes management.
positive,The Longest Day: Very good DVD movie about the WWII with Classic stellar international cast. A movie that everyone can see and enjoy.
positive,Another great book in the series: My 10 year old son has enjoyed all the books in the Harriet the Spy series.
positive,"Mixed Feelings: That this story is well written cannot be denied. What the author chooses to write about, however, is disturbing to any loyal DC comics fan. I don't think I'll ever be able to go back and enjoy any Ralph/Sue Dibny story the way I would have if I did not read IDENTITY CRISIS. What was the author's motivation for a work that left many fans feeling violated as they helplessly watched one of the most benign/likeable characters in the DC universe being subjected to one violent atrocity after another?"
negative,"i hate this: This album sucks. The song are soooooooo boring. it's just like listening to cold play but even cold play being on drugs, because sometimes people don't do things as well when they're drunk or on drugs. So, if cold play was on drugs they would not play good music and they already suck and levy is like way worse than cold play so what that does that say about their music. It's just so bad. the guitar player needs to take more lessons, maybe from the lead guitar player from new found glory becuase he rocks. ok that's all.Jason Mitchell"
negative,"Not what I thought it would be: I love Tom Clancy. In fact I can safely say that Cardinal for the Kremlin is one of my all time favorite books. So when I heard that there was a novel out there about WWIII with soviets I jumped right on it.Big Mistake.I was expecting a book about major battles and world changing events. I was expecting to see the world structure change right before my very eyes! Although this is a great concept, I feel like Mr. Clancy spent too much time on minor things.******SPOILER*******I don't care about 3 men stuck on hill 142. I didn't want to hear about the personal feelings of a submarine captain. I wanted to read about major world changing battles, and got nothing of the sort."
positive,"Classic for good reasons: This novel has become a hoary old standard of high school literature classes, but it deserves everyone's attention. In it Golding brilliantly develops the stranded childrens' point of view, enlarging it to the scale of a mythic struggle between civilization and savagery. Don't be put off by this grandiose theme: each of the main characters is a sharply drawn individual even as he represents an idea, and the prose is stunning--a pleasure to read."
positive,"Darwin's knowledge: I always wanted to read this book due to its intriguing title, thinking that it would address the very issue from the begining. Conversely, 90% of the book is about birds, animals, fish and other organisms...It gets very biological towards the middle and really detailed with birds...No matter how dissatisfied you are with Darwin's work you still have to read it. Analogous with an Al Pacino movie, even if it's not a good movie you will still be interested in watching it...All in all, it's worth spending the time with the option of quickly flipping through the birds chapters!!"
positive,"a heart-felt tearful movie - if you enjoyed August Rush, you'll love Listen to Your Heart: Listen to Your Heart is a heart-felt tearful movie. If you enjoyedAugust Rush, you'll love Listen to Your Heart. Music has the power to change lives, as demonstrated by Ariana. Deaf since childhood, she struggles between the privileged life of her mother's dominance or to reach out and risk the heartache of embracing love. ""Music is a powerful thing, one song can change your mood, make a memory. One song can change your whole life."" The lesson, ""Listen to your heart.""The film is rated NR yet is clean and will be enjoyed as a wholesome inspirational family movie."
positive,"Good explanation of Batman's origin.: I liked this movie because it delved into the origins of Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman. It was not cartoonish like the previous series of Batman movies had become. After the first batman with Jack Nicholson, it was all downhill for Tim Burton. I highly recommend this movie."
negative,"Depressing!: I own all of Amy Grant's other CD's and this is the worst! This album is so depressing, it makes sense when you realize that her marriage was on the rocks at the time. I find it amusing that she puts out one of her worst albums ever and her ex-husband (Gary Chapman) puts out one of his best. It seems like she is trying to break out of the ""Gospel & Pop"" mold that made her. I bet she does country (with Vince Gill) next."
positive,"Required Reading for every intelectual and all others!: Walter Cronkite said that this story has ..""a power that seems to grow rather than lessen with the passage of time.""This story is even more relevant today than it ever was. If you want to understand today's events and where we might be going- READ THIS BOOK! Any thinking person will see the relevance, all of those less cerebral should still take the time and either read or listen to the audio verion of this story.I simply cannot emphasize enough how vital a part of your personal library this book should become."
positive,"NOT THE GREATEST FILM.: It's worth having to see a young deniro and Keitell. This was the beginning for Deniro-Scorcese team. They would do bigger and better things in later years. This film was probably cheaply budgeted. It jumps during scenes and can be hard to follow at times. Scorcese betters his directing by the time taxi driver is released. This film does influence other films to be later released. (sopranos, Good fellas)."
negative,"Don't buy it. Don't watch it. Run.: This movie is awful. I wish I could give it less than one star. Perhaps 3/8 of a star, maybe even 5/16 of a star would be more appropriate. It is so bad that I felt it was my duty to warn the rest of mankind. It fails to be even one little bit interesting or entertaining. You have been warned."
positive,"Decent second seat: First, Amazon is wrong. This seat is NOT APROVED for over 40 lbs. DO NOT USE AFTER 40 lbs.That said, we use this frequently as a second seat and it is pretty easy to use, fits my 2 yr old son well, and the price is great. There isn't a lot of padding, so I wouldn't use it daily; however, my son has never complained about it. My only complaint would be that the straps twist easily, so you have to fix them nearly every time."
negative,"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT: I'm a fan of Richard Ashcroft and the Verve, and loved ""Alone With Everybody."" However, ""Human Conditions"" doesn't even come close to his prior work--including the fantastic ""Urban Hymns."" In fact, I was surprised how uninspiring ""Human Conditions"" is. It's a sorry departure from his traditional hypnotic, edgy tunes. ""Human Conditions"" is filled with ten forgettable, banal songs without a single one that I would call ""catchy."" I truly hope his next CD returns to his trademark sound."
negative,"Should be Java for C/C++ Programmers: The title of this book should have been, ""Java for C/C++ Programmers"". It is mostly a comparison of C/C++ programming to Java, heavy on the C part. But that is not the only problem. The author's writing style is more aimed at puffing up his own image than simple exposition of the subject. On page 91 he states, ""In 1993, I coined the term 'Bubbabyte' to describe 2^64 bytes. Just as 2^10 bytes is a kilobyte, [...] so 2^64 is a Bubbabyte."" He should have coined the term 'BubbaBrain' to describe himself. A much better book is ""Core Java, Vol 1"", by Cay S. Horstmann, Gary Cornell."
negative,"product summary: I purchased two books. One matched the description as to quality and the other was not even close to the quality that was stated when I placed the order. One book is in great shape and the other was not in good shape at all. So, I am not pleased with it at all."
positive,Great beginners book.: This book is great for beginners. This is what the school wanted. It was so much easier to order it online than try to find it in a music store.
negative,"Not My Style: I got interested in this group as I was looking at a U-Tube video that utilized the song ""Lullaby"" from the Bond Classified album as back-drop music. I was so mesmerized by the tune I bought every Bond album there was available as well as this Live video. Unfortunately, for me - all the other songs on all the other albums were nothing like the ""Lullaby"" song and quite honestly, I threw everything else in the trash. This is not to say that the group plays bad music or are untalented in any respect...This type of Techno-Symphony is just not my speed...I prefer soft rock as opposed to this."
negative,NY MEM.: I THINK THAT THIS WAS THE WRONG TYPE OF MUSIC FOR RIEU. THE FIRST DISSAPPOINTMENT WITH HIS ALBUMS.
positive,"the editorial review didn't help: i didn't like what the editor's review had to say about t.a.t.u's cd! i love t.a.t.u and they sing great! i love their music(not only their act). and i have a great feeling they're going to invade the u.s. by storm and bring household pop to a new meaning and perspective! they will reinvent pop and will be very big, i feel this to be true. i want to say, i bought their english cd, and have bought their russian cd as well. they rock!!! beautiful music, great voices, and wonderful lyrics! there couldn't have been a better band out there than t.a.t.u!!!"
negative,"Jazzinho...what went wrong?: I'm clueless as to what happened with Jazzinho's second album. I loved their first album. I waited months for this second album. I felt the songs were uninspired, and the arrangements odd.I hate writing this review, but this album was not my favorite. I didn't even like ""The Lagoon Monster"" which was one of the singles they released from this album. Very disappointed."
negative,"I'm gonna get blasted for this, but...: ... I just couldn't get into this book. It's a beat classic, so I hear, and it's about traveling and living free and enjoying life on lots of levels. From the descriptions and glowing reviews, I figured I should have loved it. I even read it while I was traveling up the US/Canadian west coast, and I grew up familiar with many of the areas mentioned in the book. In spite of all that, I didn't like it at all. For one thing, it's full of these obscure Buddhist terms and concepts, and although religion is sort of a hobby of mine, I didn't know enough to make sense of all the boddishatva-dropping, and the writing wasn't good enough to make up for that. I guess I just don't like it when the narrator introduces dialogue with ""sez I."""
positive,Great for the average investor: I found this to be an extremely useful book that takes a non Wall Street approach to the market and offers common-sense strategies for the individual investor. It was a quick and easy read and provided an array of anecdotes that are geared at helping the average investor like me. I highly recommend this book to all individual investors who want to learn about how other investors are handling the volatility of the stock market.
positive,"A fail-free link from room to room!: My TiVo and my internet connection are in separate rooms, so I was very happy to have the opportunity to avoid running big, ugly ethernet cables all over my house. This adapter allows my TiVo to talk to my wireless router (made by Netgear), which it has done for over a month, so far, without any lapses in connection. Set-up was very easy, even with my closed network (the MAC address appeared right on my TV screen, through the TiVo box, so that I could identify it from the router management page).My TiVo box is a Series-2, single tuner. The adapter is clearly fully compatible with it.It does just what I need it to do! What more can I ask?"
positive,"Great!: This collection is actually better, IMHO, all-around than the much-touted ""The Best of the Songbooks"" disk. These selections seem to have a more jazzy and emotional feel to them than the ones selected for the ""The Best Of"" CD. I just can't figure out why neither of them include ""Blue Skies"" from the Berlin songbook! ;-)"
positive,I love it!: Very high quality product as any other ty beanie baby. I love the bright colors and the soft velvetty fabric.
negative,"Too thick: I ordered same product a few years ago.However I cannot order the same product anymore.As someone mentioned, they is not available anymore.The factory is moved to thailand from Japan.Then, the quality becomes worse.My wife and I cannot feel anymore.Please try another one if you can."
negative,"Don't listen to the others!: Absolutely awful.I watched this Christmas special with an effort. When I think of bad Christmas movies, it's Santa Claus (1961), Santa with Muscles, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and A Charlie Brown Christmas.I can't believe this won an Emmy, Hollywood's most famous TV award! I would have to be on drugs in order to recognize it as such.I beggar you not to listen to the others! It's not a Christmas classic, they're lying. How can a Christmas movie have touching up on a perfectly innocent tree, teasing C.B. because of the Christmas tree, and Lucy at the end saying dialogue that I try to forget:""Charlie Brown IS a blockhead...but he gave us a nice tree.""Something that Ed Wood would perpetrate, in my highly professional opinion."
positive,"Wow!: What a poignant and precise book. Despite this book's classic reputation, I never read this in school, and really had no idea what the book was about. I really enjoyed it - and was truly shocked by how sad it was. I felt terrible after reading the ending and was surprised at how such a short book could cover such huge themes like isolation, friendship, love, death and dreams. The number of dogs were surprising, too. I liked it more than _Cannery Row_."
positive,"Texas-style roadhouse blues AT ITS BEST!!: I've seen them live three times(even though I live in California) and have 3 of their CD's. I can tell you, this is the best thing they have ever done! No bad songs on this one. Great vocals; trading leads between Joe's Strat and Bnois' Gibson, great stuff. If you like Texas blues, this is the CD."
negative,"The worst Rypdal disc by far!: I've always been of an opinion that Terje Rypdal is a much better backing guitarist in other people's bands than he is a leader and a composer.His compositions on the ""Chaser"" disc are chaotic and completely lacking any kind of substance. I could hardly get to the end of the CD. I was bored to death.In general, the drummer Audun Kleive did a hell of lot better job than the leader.BTW, I recommend another disc with Rypdal on a guitar: ""Nordic Quartet"" where he plays with SURMAN, KROG and STORAS. If you like a bit more serious Euro-jazz, listen to ""Litania"" by TOMASZ STANKO. Terje has a couple of great moments on that record."
negative,"Product seems alright, shipping NOT OKAY AT ALL.: This product smells great and seems to really make your hair soft. I used it only once but I'm not sure just how well it works just yet. I'll update in a month or two to share! What my review is about now is the messiest most dirty shipping I have EVER handled in my history of buying off of Amazon. First of all, I ordered this shampoo on February 19, and it got to me March 3rd when it said the latest it'd get to me was February 29h. Secondly, when I received the package I realized it smelled, not bad, but it smelled like soap/shampoo. The bottle EXPLODED in the box, the cap came off of the bottle, and more than HALF of the shampoo is GONE. Not knowing it exploded i opened it and all of the shampoo got on me. I would return it but I don't have the time or the car to get to the post office and send it back. I'm extremely disappointed and I'll never be buying this from here again. From now on, I'm going to the store or I'll by from Sally Hansen online."
negative,"Missing The Other Five: Like one of the other reviewers, I ordered this as a pack of six. However, it arrived and it was a single canvas in a giant box. What happened to the other five? When I contacted Amazon, it says that they're out of stock for these. Why is this happening to more than one person? Just be sure to check your box. The canvas was nice and actually what I wanted but I didn't want to pay for six and get one..."
positive,"It's Gorgeous and a Steal !: This is a gorgeous set that is reminiscent of Pier One, IKEA or Dansk, and at $8.00, it's a steal ! Beautiful quality, well-packaged, and you can't do better for price. Target has these glasses for $9.99 per pair, minus the martini shaker or the tray.If you're looking for an inexpensive gift for someone who enjoys martinis, this set would be ideal. It looks much more expensive than the price suggests and the quality is excellent."
negative,Cant get narrator off !!!!!!!!! help !!! new dvd: I cant get the narrator off in the background.. I tried 3 different dvd players.. Anyone know how ? email me at gibby@sev.org.
positive,Excellent as always: I've been a fan of Mr Koontz for a long time. This book is on par with his best works and I'm hoping to read the rest of the series soon.
negative,not for us: My husband and I are Riedel fans and have lots of their stemware and smaller glasses. But this was a miss for us.Clunky shape and not easy to drink out of. Not a great design.Stick with their old standards!
negative,"Not Patterns - but Detailed Sketches: Although I was excited to purchase this book, my excitement didn't last when I looked at the sketches / pictures in the book. I call them pictures because that is what they truly are, not actual patterns. Norma Gregory's talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transfer.This book is not for beginners - but more seasoned artisans.If you are looking for patterns, like I was, you will be disappointed in this book."
positive,"A Good CD to buy...: This CD is wonderful ! The songs on this CD are really realistic about real life, no mushy stuff ^.^"
positive,"The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living: The Streets (Mike Skinner) is one of my favorite artists around. He's very original, hard-to-categorize, and doesn't sound like a lot of other hiphop acts.This CD is yet another solid album beginning to end. It's not quite as good as A Grand..., which was a great day-in-the-life-of concept album, but this one's still great. I could see if you were a die-hard rap fan who only listened to rap, you might not like this guy.The Streets always covers diverse topics (ie, missing his dead dad); he's one of the 'realest' rappers out there, not afraid to reveal his emotions and personal life.The beats are actually decent, with more electro influences. The beats are still simple. The Streets is definitely not all about great beats; it's always been about Mike's rapping/talking. Luckily that format hasn't changed at all.This is a very solid album. My biggest complaint is that it's too short at 11 songs 37 minutes long. Recommended to fans of his previous work."
negative,"Dissatisfied: I placed an order for a book that I could have picked up in any popular bookstore but wanted the convenience of online ordering. I placed my order online December 6th, 2011 and have discovered my order will probably not arrive until after Christmas. I would not recommend this site to anyone!!!!"
positive,"Catch them on their way to the top!: I have been watching these guys play for almost two years now, and they continue to get better. Their live show is absolutly amazing, and I worried about how the live show would transfer onto a CD. When they play, they play, and play, and then play some more. Twenty minute songs are not unheard of, and this can be hard to tranfer to a cd. But they did it, and did it right. The CD is a great listen all the way through, and it can keep repeating and never get old. I have accumulated almost 20 hours of their live shows, and the cd really does them and their music justice. It really does not matter what kind of music you like, you will like this, because it is just great music."
negative,"Amazing arrogance: I agree with many of the other reviewers' criticisms of Kocour's writing style and her contemptuous attitude toward other climbers. I would add that for her to refer to her experience as ""extreme"" shows her complete lack of credibility as a climber. Ms. Kocour was bored, cold and scared, and her feet got cold -- that's all. Meanwhile, others died in the same storm. If you want to read about an ""extreme"" experience on Denali, try Davidson's Minus 148 or Waterman's In the Shadow of Denali. I also second those who recommended the Boardman-Tasker Omnibus."
negative,"A waste of the 5 billion hrs it took for this movie to end: This movie was pointless, and I really don't remember laughing at any of it. My friend and I had heard that it was funny, so we decided to watch it, it was such a waste of time, and I would not recommend that anyone waste their time watching it."
negative,"Suitable for cable: A forgettable product, a weak effort by director Rob Cohen. Joshua Jackson is disappointing as the lading character in this movie about a ""secret"" society where everybody knows who is a member or not !!! The accepted members erceive twenty thousand dollars on the spot and spend it withno low-profile at all !! A bad movie, no doubt, but you can watch it if you're totally out of options."
positive,"Daft funk.: Some may ask why, but I say bring on a collection like this. Why not? This is primo music. Is it techno or electronica, who cares, just dance and enjoy. My biggest complaints are, why six tracks from ""Homework"", and only three from ""Discovery""? Also, some of these songs like ""Rollin' & Scratchin'"" and ""Robot Rock"" are SO repetitive (I know that's the point), they get old by the three minute mark. Yet, other tracks like ""Around The World"" and ""One More Time"" are perfection, hence the classics they are. One other disappointment....where the hell is ""Digital Love""? That song should be here before many of these. Still, these are all good at the least, and it's a good sampling of their three albums. Toss on a few remixes to choice tracks like ""Da Funk"" and ""Human After All"", and you've got a collection even a robot could love. There's also a deluxe edition of this with videos, but hey, that's what Youtube is for."
positive,Highschool has gotten more interesting: I have found that highschool is more interesting now that I have read this book. I did not know about all the possibilities of existence. needless to say I am stoked about physics and have just enrolled in ap physics. this book is a inspiration. I hope I can help us become a type one civilization.
negative,"The movie sucked: Michael Myers isn't even in this sequel, that made it stupid and the plot sucked and there was absolutely no reason to make it. they shouldn't have called it a Halloween movie, it was a discrace to all the other Halloween movies which rocked."
negative,"A very substandard fissile material!: I purchased this product because I wanted to make a 5 megaton bomb to impress my neighbors at our fourth of July barbecue. Unfortunately, when all was said and done, I was embarrassed when the yield was less than 500 kt. No birds on fire, no boiling rivers, nothing.I want my money back!"
positive,"Best political book of the 21st century: Kevin Phillips - the inventor of the Republican ""southern strategy"" - has written an excellent book that describes three current problems he sees in the current Republican party: debt, oil, and the christian right. He writes in a manner that has much detail but is easily read. Mr. Phillips, a life-long Republican, presents to me, a moderate Democrat, an evenhanded discussion of these problems. He is not a fan of the Bush family so if you are one of the 30% who still believe in Dubya, you are not going to like this book.You may agree with his thesis or disagree with it but it is a very worthwhile read to at least think about his points."
negative,"a tragedy: This is a tragedy in two ways. Everyone dies at the end, and if you have to or choose to read this you will experience a tragedy.I can compare this book to a lobster.People say lobsters are a delecacy and you have to get through a shell to get to the meat.This book is a ""classic"" and you have dissect each and every sentence to get a general understanding.Avoid this book at all costs, if you have to read it in school then you are better off faking a concusion!"
positive,"Great deep messages: I loved it! I felt like a kid again. This is what we need in these times, a little bit of innocence and hope. No matter how old we are, we can still be children again. I enjoyed watching it with my nieces and nephews."
negative,"Best used for target practice: Horrible horrible horrible! I get booted from it every few minutes and then I get ""No response from wireless router or access point"" And it takes me an hour to get back on, just to be on for 5 minutes, then I have to start all over again. I can get 2 bars or signal from it while my laptop is sitting right beside it, yet my neighbors router is shown at full signal so I know it isn't my computer. This is so bad, I'd rather go back to dial up!"
positive,"FAHRENHEIT 451: Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes this book did get very weird, but it all had a purpose towards the end of the book. The author of this book had a very good idea for a story like this and he wrote it very well.Guy Montag has had his job for ten years as a fireman, but books were for burning and the houses in which they were hidden. This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire. Then he meets a professor that tells him in the future when people could think, and then he realizes what he has to do.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and I would recommend this book for you if you like Science Fiction."
positive,"Stellar: A brilliant film by any standards; has become one of my top ten films ever. Performances are stellar, and even flaws in the script become meaningless within the overall scope of both spirituality and an amazingly compelling and rich story. Castellitto can not be praised highly enough. This is not a film about Catholicism, quite the contrary, but about a man intrinsically surrendered to the sacred Spirit, to Truth and to Jesus on the most intimate level we can imagine. It is a profound meditation I watch over and over."
positive,"America's Brown Shoe Army: I'm happy to see this book is back in print!It lays out what it took/takes to be a leader. While a novel, this book is a ""history"" of the development of one officer from WWI to VietNam. I've always enjoyed this book as I enjoyed the few men I knew that were part of that group and the many I knew who learned from them."
negative,"Impressive character development but mostly morbid.: ""The Magic Barrel"" was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is ""sad,"" that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways."
negative,Copy of other peoples' work: This book from title right through to content is a copy of other peoples' work. If you want a good crochet book to learn from I suggest Vogue Knitting on the Go: Crochet Basics (Vogue Knitting On The Go) by Trish Malcolm.
positive,A Great Movie & A Great Story!: This movie is awesome! The actors and actresses are awesome! The story is awesome too! I highly recommend this movie!!
positive,Great For kids: I thought i was going to surprise my Nephews with a new thing they never saw before. But they had seen this in there day care. That didn't stop them from having hours of fun with it. It seems to be there new favorite toy.
positive,"I forgot to mention: I forgot to mention that you need a long thin phillips screwdriver to put the batteries in it since they go under the smokestack, which is something I couldn't find right away & could be a problem if you've got kids jumping up & down wanting to play."
negative,Westmoreland Identification & Value Guide: I was very disappointed in this book. I collect Westmoreland Milk Glass - primarily the grape panel pattern. There was very little in this book on milk glass. A true Westmoreland Glass book would have a great bit of it in there.
positive,"there's some serious Costik wit here: Costikyan has been around the RPG/gaming world about as long as I have--since the seventies. I recently reread this hilarious D&D fantasy story and I still got some major laughs out of it.Want an appetizer? Greg's orcs speak with a heavy New Jersey accent. ""We tanks you for our victory over da youmans"", that sort of thing. (No offense to Jersey intended.) The book is full of great touches like this, such as a lisping lizardman and a fraternal order reminiscent of the Elks.Search for this one. It's good."
positive,"Well Made: Stays in place even on my slippery end tables. Keeps coffee warm...better in some of my ceramic mugs than others....tall mugs that are wider at the top, don't heat up to the top, but generally my normal size mugs are kept at a drinkable temperature allowing me to enjoy my coffee for a longer time. The cord is exceptionally long....nice perk. Has a turn on turn off button, with a red alert light when on. Nice purchase."
negative,Not Enough Choices: There are not enough color selections for the average person. The product seems to work but Coverblend needs to work on offering more color selections as women come in a variety of shades and skin tones.
negative,"Why the religious references, this isn't Veggie Tales: I loved the humor, and the Rat, err, Mouse King's antics, but what I couldn't stand was the religous stuff. It's not advertised on the front, and it's not mentioned in any of the reviews i read on this, or even in the preview trailer. It kind of bugs me to have this great christmas classic tarnished everytime Peabo Bryson decides to sing us a song. In every scene that accompanied his songs, it seemed like Marie and the gang were in church. I actually had to watch it again to make sure i wasn't imaging them. Now if I wanted VeggieTales, I'd buy it. Other than that, it's a goofy movie that keeps my kids plenty entertained."
positive,"funny, but only for a certain type of person: You have to like REALLY distasteful, over the top humor to love Date Movie. The humor is pretty frequent, gross and intense all the way through. However, I have to disagree with the people who say the movie didn't tell a story. Maybe it's not a GOOD story, but a story is clearly there and understandable.You could easily follow along to the story, and the actual storyline segments were located at just the right moments, so it's not like the entire film was just one disgusting joke after another. There's a story there, and you don't have to look hard for it either.I think the diarrhea cat on the toilet was the best joke.If you like this movie, check out Not Another Teen Movie for more of the same."
positive,"Exceeds Expectations: First, thanks goes to the Lady who sold it to me. I ordered tbhe Keurig on Oct 23 and got is the 26th, WOW!! The Keurig was in great condition and works like a charm. I am drinking my first cup of coffee now and I am sooo happy to have this product in my home. :)"
positive,"Fantastic: Dune was one of the most intreving books (excuse my spelling) I have ever read. Its sort of Machavillian in a sense with spies, assassins, and so fourth. It has very rich layered plots that take alot of understanding to really get the FULL meaning of the book, and lots of new words you need to know (The Imperial Dictonary in the front helps ALOT) I recommend this book to anyone interested in reading how politics, mystisysm, and religion all play a single role in the Epic adventure."
negative,"Yawn De Florette: This film is a BORE. A beautifully produced, sumptuously photographed, beautifully designed, absolutely suffocating BORE.This is the kind of film that gives art films a bad name. It is the kind of literary adaptation that people just love to watch because it takes place in pretty locations, and is based on a book that no one has ever read but is acclaimed as a classic in the advertisements, and is very very very very very very long, and takes itself very very very very very very very seriously, and is just generally so very busy being so very ARTISTIC that is forgets little things like plot and characterization. I did not care about anyone or anything in this pompous load of nonsense.I was not really expected to, of course. The filmmakers are more interested in attracting tourists to France than in creating a living work of cinema.Avoid this film."
negative,"Disappointing: The text is the same as ever (I think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have purchased this volume."
negative,"1 STAR for having the GUTS to market this junk: What a disappointment?! This CD is an insult to RAGE itself. Tribute? Ha! To sum it all up, please don't go out and buy this cd, better yet avoid listening to it."
negative,"Baby dry, my butt: I love swaddlers, so after finally getting to the end of the initial stash of pampers from the baby showers etc, I started purchasing them. They cost more than other diapers, but oh well I was hooked.I got the grand idea in my head that ""Oh, baby dry? they must work even BETTER than swaddlers, DRY is right in the name!""Wrong. In a swaddler my kid could pee 2-3x and no leakage. In the baby dry, I don't know what it is about them, if she got to peeing a second time? Good lord get that thing off of her quick or she's going to leak or please no zues, oprah, or a tiny baby jesus, don't let her poop because it IS coming out the back even if I have her in a size too big without the back rolled down.I ened up using these as Daycare diapers, because there she got changed ever hour (No worries, I usually check her ever 2 hours max or at the first whiff of poop at home but that wasn't enough for baby dry)Not ever getting those things again and if they're gifted I am regifting."
positive,"amazing: This book was bought as a textbook for a class, but I will keep it because it breaks down the exegetical process step-by-step and makes it understandable! For me, this book helped to make the exegetical process exciting."
positive,"A great Baby pillow!: This is just an adorable little pillow. It will be great as an added decoration in my baby room. Remember this is a BABY pillow, so it is smaller and not made for an adult. The person who previously gave this pillow a rating thought it was too flat and small, but I found it was perfect for a baby room:) Plus! It's a perfect match to the Nautica 4 piece crib set."
positive,"Awesome!: This came with a graphic novel and a Bonus features disc! I didn't know it came with the graphic novel too, so that was a fun surprise. I bought the dvd when it was first released to watch how things were done and there was absolutely nothing on it. What a waste that was although I did watch the movie a million times. This set is awesome because it provides everything that I wanted the first time I went out and bought the dvd. I haven't even finished watching all of the bonus stuff, so that will be nothing but fun when I get to. Watching how they made the part in the beginning when the car hits the guy was friggin' awesome!!!!! Plus, I adore Peter Stormaire, Tilda Swinton, and Rachel Weisz. If you like knowing the making of stuff and graphic novels, then get this version of the dvd."
positive,"Good MoBo: It's a good Motherboard, if you don't want to spend a lot of money this is perfect, the only thing I didn't like is, the product description doesn't specify you must have a 24 pin Power Supply, so, when my MoBo arrives, I change my old one, the CPU and video card, and couldn't use it becuase I have a 20 pin Power Supply, I had to buy a new PS."
positive,"Great deal only if they give you free shipping: This was a great deal at the time for #3 size diapers with free shipping until I became a bargain shopper. Costco has a better deal IF you look at the whole picture (per diaper price). Do your home work parents! We like the ""Baby Dry"" type because it really holds the ""stuff"" in."
positive,Waited a long time for this: I waited about thirty five years to finally own this album. Love the violins with Barretto's conga.
positive,"AWESOME WORKOUT!: This is a great video and an awesome workout. I was sweating and my muscles were feeling the burn. Oreet is not only an incredible dancer but she is also a great teacher. She explains what you need to be doing and she breaks down the movements. She makes sure that you are in the correct position and that you are using the correct muscles. I take actual belly-dance classes from her and this video is pretty much like being in class. Its fun, easy to follow and gives you a great workout. I highly recommend it.Diana"
positive,"A book that people borrow and forget to return.: Rebecca Smith's work on Electronic Resume's and Online Networking is a must read. It's one of those books that you hate to loan out, for fear of it not being returned! The definite, premiere work on strategic methods for succeeding in a competitive job market!"
negative,"This Is a Very Boring Read: For some reason I thought this novel was for adults although in retrospect looking at the cover should have told me otherwise. Set in the South, North Carolina, it is the story of Jim who never knew his father. The guy died at 23 of a heart attack, and his widow remained faithful to him, never considering remarriage. However, Jim has the love and support of his three unmarried--bachelor?--uncles. They live on a farm, and this is a sort of coming-of-age story. Quite possibly adolescents might like it. But it is a dull, dull read."
positive,"FINALLY-no crying during the night: My 6 month old daughter usually wakes up and cries for 5 or so minutes around 3:00. Last night, I installed this on her crib. When she woke up, she hit it to turn it on and went right back to sleep-no crying!!! I love this."
positive,"Perfect fit. Check engine light is history.: Check engine light kept going on and off in my 2002 Honda CRV. A few dollars for the cap from Amazon, or a day at the dealer and considerable cash for ""diagnostics"" and repair. I say Amazon."
negative,Good chap stick awful flavor: The zombie flavor is just gross. The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I couldn't get over the smell of this flavor.
positive,"Informative, Insightful, Useful, and Practical: I must admit I found Thomas Sowell somewhat difficult to understand. However, given the abstract nature of the book, I'm not sure many writers could have written much better. But once you get into the frame of mind and synchronize with Sowell's presentation flow, it becomes readily apparent that this man is a deep thinker with useful insights into the basis for political ideologies. The book is not especially historical with regards to shifts in political attitudes. However, he does present political ideologies in such a way that allows the reader to compare and contrast and to understand the essential basis for the differences in those ideologies. A definite must-read for the political junkie and certainly for any political science student. Just be prepared to concentrate like you never have before and I think you too will appreciate the insights of Thomas Sowell."
negative,"What a disappointment: As an avid sci-fi reader, I felt I had to rectify an oversight and read the book that really is a foundation of much of today's sci-fi. When I started the book, I planned to read the entire series. I was so completely let down that I don't know if I'll ever read Asimov again. Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating. Kudos to Asimov for opening the door for better writers but too bad his work (at least this early work) is terrible. Don't waste your time reading this one. Go straight to the many better post-Asimov authors."
negative,"bad buy: I bought a set of these and they're a cool novelty, being the guy who has flask sandals. There's a couple problems though, one sandal leaked all 1 shot of booze out. The other sandal, even after many washings with dish soap, still make whatever alcohol I put in them taste nearly unbearable, even when poured into a mix. Not worth any amount of money spent on these, do not buy them."
positive,"Nothing but the Classics.: This is packed with all the classic Commodores hits, including Painted Picture which is one of my favorites. This is well worth the money. Oh, the sound quality is good as well."
negative,"Waste of money. Zero star. I'll never buy any movie made in the 1960's again.: This DVD is a waste of money because of 2 things.1. DVD qualityThe quality is terribe. The color looks washed out. The film is grainy. Most of the time it's in zoom mode. So all I can see is the faces and shoulders of the actors even when they're dancing!2. The plot is boring.What a waste of money. The only good western film made in the 1960's is ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"""
negative,"Great book, but Kindle edition riddled with errors: I'm reading The Big Rock Candy Mountain for the first time. Great story. Unfortunately the Kindle edition is filled with punctuation and spelling errors, presumably from the digital conversion. I tried to figure out how to 'return' the book since I can easily check out a paper copy for free from the library, but apparently Amazon doesn't allow returns of ebooks. Or at least not in a way that's obvious to me. Thumbs down on Amazon's quality control, at least in this instance. And at $12.99 it should be much cleaner."
positive,"A MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN TRUE CRIME!! RIVETING!!: Last year I found this book and once I opened it I could not put it down. Bugliosi is excellent at bringing the details to life on the page. Not only do we get a first hand account of the trial, but he also explains much of the legal process in very clear and understandable terminology. I am now a fan of his work and will be reading everything I can of his."
positive,"The best: As a history major in college with an emphasis on the Medieval period I was blessedly introduced to Henry Adams. It's been forty some years since I first read Mont Saint Michel and Chartres and this is still the best. It is a spiritual journey into the heart of the Middle Ages, both secular and sacred. Simply put: It's a classic."
negative,"Sacreligious: I agree with the ""disappointing"" review and would add that the resolution of the mystery could have and should have been without the author's own agenda. To suggest that the Blessed Mother would actually call for murder, suicide, abortion, homosexuality and promiscuity in the priesthood is appalling! I would not reccomend this book to anyone and as I am a full time employee of a county library in an upscale community, I will tell our patrons to pass on this novel."
negative,Stopped working after three uses: Ceramic pieces inside of unit are very brittle and become detached with use. Pieces find their way into the fan mechanism and jam the motor so the fan will not rotate. The unit is useless at this point. Mine lasted three or four uses over six months.
positive,"Forever changed my ""Pharisee-like"" attitude: This book shows how to truly ""walk in the Spirit"" It highlights Romans 5- 8 and shows how our self-improvement efforts will always be ""vanities of vanities."" We have to put our faith in Jesus. He's the One who did it all. Based on the content you can tell the author was greatly influenced by Watchman Nee's book ""The Normal Christian Life"" (also a VERY good book). Stop trying to fix something that God didn't intend to fix. Free the shackles and experience a true walk in Victory."
negative,"Worst diapers on the planet: Worst Diapers ever!! I've been using these diapers for three days and they have been nothing but stress to me. These diapers truly leak even if they are not full. The material that they are made of tear very easily if I even carry my 22 month old daughter the wrong way. I was completely dissatified when I used them when she was a size 3, and I'm upset that I allowed myself to buy these again. They were only a few cents cheaper than the Huggies Snug and Dry which don't leak at all. I used to have great respect for Pampers but I refuse to waste my time with the company to call and complain. I am embarassed to give these to someone, and will end up just donating them."
positive,"an almost necessary tool.: I could easily have made this tool, but I'm getting lazy in my old age. It beats using a pair of channel locks, and much neater."
negative,"LEAKS!!!!: These diapers are horrible! I've had 3 in the last 2 days leak. I should have just gone with Swaddlers. The sad thing is I have 246 diapers to use, with the potential of them leaking again! They also have a horrible smell. It's supposed to smell clean or fresh, but it just doesn't. It's too strong. The smell I can get over, but the leaking I cannot. You can see where it will leak since the blue lining with all the absorbency doesn't even go all the way to the edge."
positive,"Great Book: Ron's book is remarkable. I have been doing Real Estate Investing the LeGrand way for a year now. I have made a great profit and my wife and I are very excited about the prospect for the future. This book is a good foundation for more education on creative real estate by Ron and others.Quick Turn Real Estate is not a Get Rich Quick Scheme like some of the others, but it is a Get Rich Business. You can do this!!! with no money or credit!! I have done deals on properties of over $350,000 with only $250 of my own money in the deal.This book takes over where Robert Kiyosaki left off. It is the meat of the entree. I didn't know how to do real estate investing after the Rich Dad's Series, but it got me interested just like it was suppose to do. Ron and his techniques will get me where Robert said I needed to go.Fantastic. Buy it. Read it. Live it. Don't be a thinker brain, be an alligator brain and just do it."
negative,"Milk It: Some Of The Box: Four stars for the music, minus 2 stars for the concept. The review title represents exactly how I feel about this disc. One can't pretend that this disc is anything but a quest for more money, and some will agree with me that this doesn't even represent the box very well at all. This is one of those discs that, if you are a die-hard collector, you would buy, but most collectors already have the box anyway, so that makes you less likely to buy this one. Also, if you weren't a big fan and you bought the disc actually thinking it was the ""best"", it wouldn't give an accurate overview of the box and you'd probably become uninterested. So basically, if you must have the few extras, find it cheap or used, and if you're a first timer, let this be the last thing you add to your collection. It's been said a few times already, but just get the box and make your own comp. Why buy the milk when you can get the whole cow for...a little more?"
negative,"Depressing: Why do they make high school kids, whose lives are already fraught with uncertainty and uneasiness, read such depressing books? I suppose back in the 1950""s this was a fresh new picture of totalitarianism, but today pick up any newspaper and you see this story all over our modern world. It's not that I think Orwell isn't relevant, it's just that I think high school English teachers could do a little research, find books that are well-written, expand horizons, but that lift people up, not depress them. Maybe books that would help kids, at their vulnerable age, to laugh, become wiser, and look at others with more compassion. ""Cold Sassy Tree"" comes to mind. Something with warmth, humor and wisdom, rather than bleakness."
positive,"The BEST yet!: Wow.... wow... wow. Having been a long-time fan of Dierks Bentley ever since he came out with his first cd, I must say that this newest cd far exceeded my expectations. This is his best cd ever! He has truly come so far in his musical career, and you can really hear and feel the emotions behind the songs. What I love about this is he stays true to himself, and is honest in everything he sings. All of these songs are my favorites! Every one of them is unique and just fantastic.if you're looking for great, enjoyable quality country music, this is the cd for youWAY TO GO DIERKS!! Keep it up!!!!"
positive,Great CD from a Great Artist: This cd is truly worth the wait! I can listen and enjoy each and every song in the CD.Invisible and Measure of the Man are the best!Platinum for Clay !!
negative,"A new model of the universe: I felt mis led and ripped off. I purchased this book for a relative. I searched google and found it to be cheaper and New at this store.I wanted a book not an expensive sample of a book. I did not even know items like this existed. I would like to see a caution in the preview of items like this or a Water mark stating ""Not the full Book"" or ""Preview of Book only"".If you don't click on the full description of the item you do not realize that this is not the book. Even though the name, viewable index shows 500 + pages. I wanted the whole book at a paper back price which is what I thought I was getting. This is just copies of some of the pages and only 60 to 80 pages at that. What a rip off. Who would want such a thing for $17.00 shipped.Be aware of the price. The actual book is 35.00 or more and be sure you are getting the book then too.Did not re order.This turned me away."
negative,"Heh: When in doubt, overproduce music and market it as lesbian chic... This is just the latest iteration of the Britney formula, and maybe soon it will all just end. Where's grunge redux?"
positive,Loved it: It was just what I thought it was. I loved it. I watched a couple of time. I'll have to take it with me to my brothers so my nephews can see it.
negative,"Worst movie ever made!: This movie has nothing to do with Michael Meyers, so why is it titled Halloween III?!!!"
negative,"NO, NO, and NO!: I only made it 15 minutes into this movie before I turned it off. My only question (and this pertains to plot, action sequences, dialogue, etc.) is WHY?"
negative,pop rap do i need to say more: It's artist like Nelly that ruion good rap called gangsta rap bringing it pop sounding...So if your like a 13 year girl or a elementary boy then you might like this cd...Im tire of this pop rap bring back the 90's sound the g funk beats with the synthnsiezer sounds and gutter rap talk...I would say 90% of rap sucks nowdays every onces in a while a few hardcore rappers that havent switch there sound bring us some good material like brotha lynch hung or spice 1 or even the dayton family so I hope this help yall stay away unless you like crap rap....
negative,"BORING! 50 pages was all I could stand.: Sorry, folks, I guess I'm just a weirdo. I simply don't have the patience for authors who feel compelled to describe, in minute detail, every snowflake on every leaf of every branch of every tree... or every spoonful of sugar that a character puts into every cup of coffee. How about a little PLOT, Ms. Inness-Brown??? I forced myself to read 50 pages of this, because it was recommended highly by a dear friend, but decided life is just too short to keep on slogging, when there are so many other things to read."
negative,"If you wany a good science fiction book do not read this boo: I read this book and I found that, though the story idea was okay, the author used too much description and not enough action and wrecked what could have been an excellent book"
negative,"A Little Disappointing: After playing games like Burnout 3, this game seems a little shallow, the open world isn't as fun as it sounds, there aren't too many tipes of game, the showtime is great at first but after a few times it's just boring..the game has great graphics, great controls, but Burnout used to be a good crashing game. Now the crashing seems to be a secondary objective in a game that doesn't have a primary one."
negative,"BBB stop entering on our market such lemons!: This product is a waste of money,everything meaning quality is ZERO in this AudioSource product!I dispensed it!"
negative,Timmy's Special Delivery: I have the movie in vhs but wanted to purchase it on dvd for my younger grandchildren who love the vhs. The vhs is giving us trouble. When I ordered the dvd they said it was in stock and charged me for the dvd. Then I was given a refund and told they did not have it. I would really like to have this dvd for my babies. I was very disappointed. I wish you wouldn't have said you had it then said you didn't. My review for the dvd is excellent but for your company ...poor.
positive,"A good primer for the generations who followed: The Greatest Generation doesn't recreate the overwhelming experience of WWII as well as War of the Rats or The Triumph & the Glory, or other recent best-selling novels set during WWII, but it is pretty good at what it does--which is recounting in a straight forward fashion some of what that generation endured to win a war that had to be won."
positive,"A Great Book: Gripping, can't put the book down, detailed, exciting. I like how the book keeps adding new adventures, and held my interest to the very end. A great page turner."
positive,"Statisticians don't like this book - what a surprise!: For someone who has not read this book, the disparity in reviews is probably striking. Those literally looking for a statistics course, or especially statisticians, will be disappointed. This book is about understanding and interpreting statistics from a practical standpoint. Ignore the statisticians - they are being sensitive about how their work is abused. Ignore the students looking for a statistics book - that isn't the intent of Huff's work.This is one of my favorite books of all time. It helped me become a much more discerning consumer of news. This book is intended to help you better comprehend stat's that are thrown at you to make a point - which essentially means all stat's. Unfortunately, many times this is done is disingenuous ways, and this book will help you see through such foolishness.In short - buy this little book. It is one of the best book values you will ever find."
positive,"12 play 2 continued..........another hit from kelly: This new one from R. Kelly is another tight cd. There is not too much that is new here. Its a combination of the stuff he did on the 12 play album and his last album Rated R. Anyone who likes R. Kellys music should check this one out. The songs I think stand out R: 2,3,5,7,8,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. If you expect to hear something new that will set him apart from stuff he did in the past then this isnt for you, but if you just want to hear something new from kelly with something extra added then this is it."
positive,great: this is an awesome ending of the elm street series. Wes Craven does a great job of putting this movie together. Great acting by everyone and great plot.
negative,Lame: Recipes are a bit strange and not easy to follow. I wouldn't recomment this book at this time for anyone serious about cooking.
positive,Good movie: I like all of the transformers movies. This one is fun too. I would recommend it to any fan of the first two movies.
negative,"Bad printer: Do not buy this printer. I have had nothing but trouble with it- it jams every other time I print, and most of the time, it grabs 3-4 papers at once, and prints on all of them. I certainly expected better quality from HP, and this did not deliver. The printing is decent when it works, which is not often. I will be looking for a different company next time."
negative,Disappointed: I can't begin to describe my disappointment in this book. Perhaps it was simply Hilary Mantel's writing style but I found it annoying to try to follow her train of thought. Often I wasn't sure of the narration perspective; was it O'Brien's narration at times and then at others the author's? I'm frankly amazed at the books apparent popularity.
positive,Great workout: This is an amazing DVD. Myself and 4 other friends worked out together and we had so much fun. We all had to sweat and enjoyed the pain the day after! This DVD is not for beginners but beginners can still try it and just take it a little bit easier!If you want to bring your body in shape -> buy this DVD! Excellent motivation and great exercise! Enjoy!!!
positive,"Great Gospel and Blues Singers: An NPR recording introduced me to Irma Thomas. Once I knew of her, she kept reappearing in other contexts - a folk and blues anthology, with Marcia Ball and Tracy Nelson ... and, of course, on her own recordings. The range of her recordings and artists recording with her are a tribute to her musicianship.Her gospel music on this album is consistently good and most of it is excellent esp. Hold to God's Unchanging Hand and Walk Around Heaven All Day. Her interpretation is both ""traditional"" and unique - you'll not mistake her for other greats such as Marion Williams or Mahilda Jackson ... but if you appreciate them you will enjoy Irma Thomas."
positive,"Classic Bronson: If you like action movies check this one out,as the action is cartoonish,like when Bronson takes out a old world war 2 machine gun and starts mowing down the bad guys.but my funniest bit has Bronson getting ready to fight the bad guys by putting on a bullitproof vest and arming himself to the teeth,yet when his friend comes by to help him armed with only a zip gun ,Bronson does not offer him any of his arsenal of weapons!."
positive,"Work In Office? Then This Movie Is For You!!: By far the best office movie that I've seen. Wonderfully acted, and superbly written, this is a small budget movie everyone will like.No one who sees this movie can forget the line, ""Why does it say paper jam, when there is no paper jam?""If you've been looking for a movie that you would love to watch over and over again, and still laugh at the same jokes, then this is it. I never knew how truthful the movie was until starting my new job. Now, I'm in a cubicle and can really ""feel their pain.""If you haven't seen this movie yet, then what are you waiting for?"
negative,Profoot Toes Beds: Profoot Toes Beds weren't what I expected. Couldn't get them to stay on. They kept off in my shoe. They didn't protect my toes at all.
positive,"Heavy duty grater: I bought this grater because my old one didn't have the medium holes. It has all the sides I need - slicer, medium/large grater and zester. I don't care much for the zester because I have the Microplane. I will use this mainly for cheese anyway and it has all the surfaces I need. I love the neoprene handle and bottom. Great quality and value! Best of all, I got it as the free item from the 4-for-3 deal."
negative,No Internet!: Guess what word does not appear in this book? That's right... INTERNET!Not even once!So Naisbitt missed the biggest trend of the nineties!
positive,"Nice for the Price: This DVD is nice for the price. The description says Region 1, but its region 0. The video and audio are about the same as others on the market, but the menus are well designed (very retro!) All 12 chapters are on one dual layered disc and the layer change doesn't interfere with the movie. There are no extras, but hey for the price, what do you expect?"
positive,good and stable: Very easy to use. The cooked rice is delicious. The only problem is that it cooks very slow.
negative,"Stick with the computer version: I am a Simaddict.I know what it is like to stay up until three or four in the morning downloading the perfect skins, creating children, and attempting to get abducted.Bottom line: no Playstation version of the Sims comes remotely close to the addictive fun of the computer version.The freedom is gone.In Computer Sims, part of the fun is that you are like the SIM'S G-d but in this you are so very limited.I don't like itI don't recommend it.If it's a gift...eBay it, or regift it to someone you are not so fond of."
positive,"Nelly going strong with another hit.....: I love #16 ""Tired"" w/ Avery Storm. This cd will take him further to the top. I love the cd and Nelly, #1 here he come billboards and everything else, he comin. Dont be alarmed."
positive,One very good fantasy book: For someone who started this at 15 it's really good and I haven't even finished it yet.Like what a lot of authors want it makes me want to read the sequel and i'm not much of a fantasy reader but if it makes me not want to put it down (especially at night when I have to go to bed) then he must have talent for capturing someone's imagination.Even thogh I'm practically on the opposite side of the world and haven't any stuff for it then I recomend that you get this.
positive,"Magical Mystery Tour: There are some really good tunes on here. Magical Mystery Tour is a pretty standard Beatles song. Fool On The Hill is good, too. The real highlight on the album is Lennon's Strawberry Field's Forever, which is a masterpiece.Bluejay Way is one of those psychedelic songs from the era, and it's a nice piece by Harrison. How could you not like I Am The Walrus? Closing out the record is All You Need Is Love, which was the anthem for a decade...need more be said?"
positive,excellent: This is the 2nd order for me. I give one can as a gift and keep the other for me. Great chocolate and good almonds. I think this is supposed to be good for you.
positive,"Great CD: Love, Love, Love, this CD. The song selection is fantastic. There is something for everyone. Whether these are the songs of your youth or you are new to this music, this CD will blow you away. The harmonies are amazing, their voices blend so well together. Jack and Tommy really know how to stay true to the song and also make it their own at the same time. I love each and every track. It has not left my CD player since it has arrived. A must have for your music collection.!"
negative,"Gives me a headache...: This guide does contain a lot of valuable information, but it is very poorly written - not a professional quality document - lengthy, wordy prose, long paragraphs, poorly organized. For some reason, these calculators are plagued with horrible documentation, no matter who writes it. Apparently, the assumption is that if you're smart enough to use them, you should be smart enough to figure them out. This is true - but it's time consuming and not worth it unless you REALLY need the functionality they provide. If you must use one of the advanced HP calculators, this pamplet may be of some help if it doesn't give you a headache - otherwise buy an HP 40GS, which is the best grapher on the market by a long shot and costs half the price of a 50G. 40GS comes with a great manual and is very intuitive to use and program."
negative,"Poor mechanics: We have owned this Jack in the box for about a month and a half. The music has already stopped working and we didn't even play with it on a daily basis, much less on a weekly basis. I wouldn't recommend this toy."
negative,"you ain't the only vet out there John: If John Kerry believes he is qualified to be President of the United States simply because he is war a veteran....5 million other veterans of this nation should be on the ballot as well. Mr. Kerry stop talking about Vietnam and start talking about the issues. No one in the country wants to be reminded about a war we lost. My registration card says democratic, but come November my vote will not."
negative,"poor quality: This is the worst diaper I have used out of all the different brand of pampers. Just because it is more in quantity doesn't mean it is a good quality. I am not ready to more on yet, so I am giving the pampers cruiser a try before I make a final decision to move to another brand of diapers. I am hoping we can still continue to do business, since I have being using this brand for 8 years for all my children."
positive,"I was lost, and then with Emanuel, I was found...: This book saved my grade in Constitutional Law. A week before the final I was so confused and lost in the material and I was freaking out! I bought this book as a last hope at saving my grade, and not only did it save my grade, I got one of the best grades in the class!! This is the BEST supplement I have seen yet that explains and ties everything together. I would recommend it a thousand times over to all law students who need a little (or a lot) of help with Constitutional Law."
positive,Great ring to real life: A story of hope - from a lost cause to glorious circumstances. It affirms the view that in life there are second chances for us to take and change our circumstances
negative,"Sent damaged product: I received this DVD in a well packed box with another item. The other item was in perfect condition. However, this DVD's case was broken in several (at least 4) places. As I said, the box was well packed and insulated. The DVD had obviously been sent in the damaged state it was received in. Most disturbing is the fact that the damage to the DVD case was so OBVIOUS. Pieces are broken off inside the celephane wrapping that you can see and, when you pick it up, you cannot miss feeling them.The DVD itself skips in several places.Unacceptable and unethical behavior on the part of the sender. They had to have known they were sending me a severely damaged DVD case. It had to have been damaged at the time they packed it in the box.As a result, I was not able to give it as a gift as planned."
positive,One of the best CD's of 1998!: Version 2.0 is a GREAT CD. It's one of those rare CD's where almost every single song is incredible. It is high energy power driving music that instantly puts me in a good mood and makes me want to thrive!
positive,great resource: Krigger explains energy use and conservation in a very simple way. Very informative resource that I foresee using for many years to come.
positive,"Excellent: Great film with two great actors. Funny, witty, charming. Allows you to see that although education may make you smarter, it doesn't necessarily make you better."
negative,"Trower's Worst CD Yet by ten million miles!: I'm a guitarist and have been a big Trower fan since the very beginning. For the life of me, I can't understand how Robin has lost his ear for decent songs and vocals. For the life of me, I can't understand how any true Trower fan could even mention the title of this CD and ""Bridge of Sighs"" in the same sentence. This would make a decent Tom Petty album, but it makes a terrible Robin Trower album. It's tired, draggy, and monotonous, not even considering the ""Bob Dylan's grandmother"" vocals. Robin desperately needs a new vocalist and a decent songwriter. The only decent CD he's released in the last few years is 20th Century Blues.....and it's not that great....but a helluva lot better than this!"
negative,"GARBAGE is NOW DEFINED as THIS PRINTER: PLEASE this is a warning! Do not buy this printer!!! Avoid at all costs!! HP tech support is useless and clueless. I had it for 3 days when it started jamming 100% of the time. PLUS, as a graphic designer I need my output to be tru to scale, this junk prints a 4 inch square as a 4.125 inch square! It does NOTHING good, plus it ran out of color ink after 40 pages!!I wish they had negative 5 stars"
positive,"A Unique and Classic Western: I am a huge Marlon Brando fan and this is one of my favorites. Although Brando is always interesting to watch, he goes above and beyond the call of duty in this film. Jack Nicholson is also superb, as always, and the other actors are great as well. A very entertaining film."
positive,"Not for under 4: My 3-yr-old daughter loves the Little Einsteins. She was so excited when she got the book. However, reading the book to her was difficult. It's very long and wordy and a little hard to follow. She likes the pictures and if I simplfy it as I read it, she loves it. I do recommend it for an older preschooler or even a younger school aged child. It covers metamorphasis and can be used to supplement that learning in school."
negative,"Bastardization of a beautiful garment: This book takes the beauty of the traditional kimono and turns it into an abomination as ""art to wear"". The kimono already IS art to wear. It doesn't need to be dragged down by modernization.But that is not my only problem with this book. In the history section, written by Toshiki Wada, the editing is so bad that spelling mistakes are made and repeated. Also, Miss Wada needs to pick up a history book sometime very soon. Her grasp on the history of Japanese clothing is tenuous at best and the more bad history sections she writes (like this one and the one in ""Shibori""), the more misinformation she disseminates to the English-speaking public.Ignore any historical information on the kimono written or ""edited"" by Wada. Go out and buy Dalby instead."
positive,"great book: i was having trouble in school and my mom gave me this book. it saved me, it is easy to read and really makes sense. i'd reccomend it to anyone having any trouble at all in high school"
negative,"Well....: The writing is very good, but the true and simple test of a novel is to ask oneself these questions: Do I care about the characters? Can I stop reading this book right now and never wonder about how it ends? If you answer no to the first question and yes to the second, it is not a good work of literature. The Line of Beauty is, unfortunately, one of these novels. Tedious, overly mannered and stifling."
positive,"Life-changing: My number one all time favorite book. Clarified many things about racism and religion in America, by the most eloquent voice I've ever had the pleasure of reading."
positive,"Good Addition to the Pearl Jam Library: I've been a loyal Pearl Jam fan since day one, and I have yet to be dissapointed by any of their releases. But they have a lot to live up to and, as much as I hate to say it, this is my least favorite PJ album to date. I'd still recommend it, but it's definately got a narrow range by Pearl Jam standards. The tempo is largely quasi-slow with no real Porch or Sonic Reducer-ish fast songs.Now don't get me wrong- I still thoroughly enjoyed this CD and I recommend it. Many of the tracks like 'Nothing is as it Seems' and 'Grievence' are very solid. But, if you had no other Pearl Jam CD's and you could only afford one, I'd recommend Vitalogy or Yield."
positive,"Review of Jonathan Winters ""A Christmas Carol"": A very intertaining & interesting rendition of my favorite Christmas story, ""A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens"". I have over 30 different versions of this classic and this one is the most unique. If you are a collector of ""A Christmas Carol"" you need to at least take a look."
negative,need very long time to cook: Unless you have soemone at home to press it one hour before meal. Otherwise it takes at least 40 minutes to make rice ready. It is not good for both those couples without enough time for cooking. It take 1 hour and 30 minutes for stick rice. which is crazy for me....
negative,"Heed the bad reviews: Heating element started falling out immediately on first use. Returning and paying a little more for a better product. The case is nice and the extras, but one used and dead? Not worth it."
negative,"Booo...: This book and its author bothers me for the following reasons:1) Just because he wrote this when he 15 does NOT automatically make this a great book2) For the record, it ISN'T a great book.3) The story is derivative4) Of Tolkien5) And God knows how many other fantasy novels6) It's sappy7) It's unengaging8) You can tell it was written by a 15-year-old9) The Editing is horrible! (Who edited this? Oh right...HIS PARENTS)10) Frankly, I think it's a waste of paperOn the other hand, the title page art is lovely."
positive,"Watered down Robocop,Robo Ninja: Robocop 3 was released in 1993.The rating is pg-13.Peter Weller is replaced by Robert John Burke(Safe,Limitless).The movie is directed by Fred Dekker(Ricochet),written by Frank Miller.Robocop 3 stars Remy Ryan(Monkey Trouble),Rip Torn(Men In Black,Extreme Prejudice),CCH Pounder(Face Off,Avatar),Mako(Pearl Harbor,Conan the Barbarian),John Castle(Gods and Generals).Omni Consumer Products OCP have created a new armed forces known as the Urban Rehabilitators and call themselves rehabs.They are leaded by Paul McDagget (John Castle).They have better weapons and are more trained than the Detroit Police.They are mostly to kick out the remaining residents of Cadillac Heights and other areas.There is an underground resistance of civilians which the rehabs are tracking down."
positive,"BUY THIS BOOK: I recommend this book to all of my patients. I have yet to see a mother who purchased this book in the last part of pregnancy, not ""make it"" breastfeeding.If you plan to breastfeed, this book is one to have in your bag, take to the birth center or hospital and believe me, you will use it and find it helpful.This combined with Simkins ""Birth Partner"" are two absolute essentials for purchase in late pregnancy."
positive,"Mixed feelings: I have mixed feelings about this product. Before buying this product, I went online and read several posts that said that they had issues with the product being too tight. Surprisingly, I find this product slightly big, even though I bought the right size. This might be related to the garment not feeling tight enough, but I also measured myself before and after I put in the garment and found that I did NOT lose inches. As a matter of fact, I was the same even after I hooked myself up on the smallest setting. But maybe that's because the material of this garment is a bit on the thick side? Not sure. Anyways, I think I'm going to send it back for the smaller size and see what happens. It does flatten my rolls of fat though..."
positive,"Disney can take their movies and stick em up their wazoos: Disney artists need to take lessons from this movie. Disney uses a lot of lazy computer animation, which usually looks horrible.This movie is 99 percent actual hand drawn animation. All of which looks superb.The music is also great. About 6 great songs with that 80's hard rock attitude.For another example for great hand drawn animation, check out G.I. Joe the movie."
negative,"One of the worst games I ever played on 64!: This game is EXTREMELY boring, it has very cheap graphics, andis extremely hard to follow. I would only suggest this game to peoplewho are really, really obsessed with Mortal Kombat or the character Sub-Zero. It has really hard controls and is not fun at all. I would definately rent this game before buying it. END"
negative,"Poorly written...painful to read: As a redhead, I was excited to read this book about the myth and lore of redheads...not to read about the author's own ""flowing like water red hair and her flickering hazel eyes."" The author's overuse of unnecessary metaphors and meaningless personal anecdotes made this book incomprehensible to even the most astute reader. By page 3 of this book, an intended recreational read had quickly turned into an agonizingly painful endeavor.Don't bother reading this book, if you are interested in the myth and lore of redheads, Google ""red head"" and watch ""I Love Lucy"" reruns."
negative,i love the squids!: i have both vol. one and two... love them! i ordered vol. three from copemania and that was in early march .. still getting the runaround! it is April 21st. and i am still waiting.....if i ever get it i know i will love it too!
positive,TIVo reborn: easiest thing in the world. unwrap it - plug into USB port - and Tivo begins downloading programming immediately. My wife loves me
positive,"Excellent Read for Mom & Sons: Me and my 2 1/2 year old boy just LOVED this book. He is very much into numbers and has been counting for a few months, so I got this book for him. It's one of the few books he sits for through the whole story. He especially loves the page for ""four"" ;).It is also good for his older brother, who is in kindergarden and learning how to read / spell the number words."
negative,"Conserve narratives: reuse, reduce, recycle: First, there is nothing new in this book. Everything he says here he has said in the earlier books. Second, there is very little in the way of plot or character development. You are halfway through the book before the threat to the universe is even described. All the characters are almost cameo reprives of previous performances. Except the new characters who are introduced and then promptly droped from the narrative. Third,the few more or less new notes are nearly all obvious reworkings from other writers. The eighteen month old hyperprecocious girl who knows the size of her father's erect penis and has started a waiting list of partners for when she begins having sex just reeks of the Lazarus Long style of deliberately shocking sexuality. Based on this book I would say Spider Robinson has become a tired old man."
negative,"For small gutter minds: There is much raunch in this movie trying to pass as humor.And give me a break. Sandler a ""man about town"" banging the tourists evry chance he gets. YUK. Oh but wait! He gets totally reformed overnight and becomes the most selfless, committed, sacrificial man who is willing to wait forever and enjoy a lifelong relationship with a woman who forgets him every day. Sure. Maybe if he would have been a virgin looking for his one true love then it would have been beliveable.And all the boob, ass, homo, vomit, sex jokes are just plain mindless and talentless. ""are you sure you will still love her in 15 years if she lets herself go and sex with her is nauseating"" How would you like that said as you say your wedding vows while the ""preacher"" is looking at his fat wife? It's not funny. It's just tasteless and tacky.The only good thing about this movie is the end."
positive,"An excellent introduction to Barthes: More accessible than some of his others, this book nevertheless exhibits the same pyrotechnic, questing intelligence that makes everything from his hand a delight to read. Excellent translation maintains a high order language as thrilling as it is conceptually sophisticated. The argument is not an academic one; rather, this is speculative writing at its most adventurous. A title for those who consider the brain their favorite organ."
positive,Excitement from the magazine section at the supermarket: This is a great documentary slash story. All of us who've browsed the muscle mags at the supermarket with embarrassed discretion when the grocery moms wheelled down the aisle now know we were not alone. Fabulously presented.
negative,"Cobra Antenna: This is a very poor product! On my first trip, it fell of my car roof at 40 MPH. Not nice.It is clear that the base is insufficient for an antenna of this length."
negative,"Post Captain Disappoints: I am a great fan of the Aubrey-Maturin series, so I am loathe to write anything negative. However, I have struggled to finish ""Post Captain"". It is tedious reading, and dull for the most part. The book never really establishes a plot line. It shifts through a listless struggle between Aubrey and Maturin's romantic aspirations, and then back to Jack's dicey struggle with his chain of command. The book confuses and makes painful reading at times. It lacks the sublime feeling I had from reading other volumes in the series."
positive,"WELL WORTH YOUR TIME: This first of two novels from the youngest and least-known Bronte sister, it is an eye-opening account of the career of a governess, the only respectable job for middle-class single women in the mid-1800s. True, the style of writing is quite different from Charlotte & Emily, but it is still worth your time. Anne based events and characters in this book on her failed career as a governess for two families in Yorkshire. A very satisfying work, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
positive,"Good CD: I heard Milk Rock and Spin Spider Spin on internet radio but I fell in love with Tiger. If she were to make a greatest hits CD I would vote for Tiger to be on it. It has a great flow to it like all of her music. On this CD I also liked Gently Waves and Soft Grafitti which are both quietly beautiful. I don't think the length of the song should dictate how much you like it, and that's certainly true of Gently Waves."
positive,"Life, the Universe and... well... Almost Everything.: Sixteen stories of Life from the tiniest most pervasive virus to the broadest span of all creation. Features the following authors: John Binns (Editor), Trevor Baxendale, David Bailey, John Seavey, Mark Stevens, Ian Farrington, Jonathan Morris, Richard Salter, Kate Orman, Steve Lyons, Matthew Griffiths, Gareth Wigmore, Alexander Leithes, Andrew Campbell, Lance Parkin, Todd Green and Jim Mortimore."
positive,"anolon saucepan: Anolon makes awesome kitchenware, and this saucepan is no exception. I highly recommend Anolon products!"
positive,"Two words: It's AWESOME: This CD is great, and I can't wait until they come out with another. They all are great looking and have great voices. So I can't rate them by those two factors. All in all you Guys ROCK!"
positive,AWESOME: This is an awesome artist ... i came in contact with her when we were both young... we were both in a musical named Grease .. one day i just happened to look online to see if she became something and here she has a cd out ... this is a great cd EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM ... its great ... if you love Ani Defranco you will love her .... its great and i dont say that about everyone ... not just because i knew her once apon a time but because she is a great artist...buy this album u will love it
negative,"What happened?: I don't know what happened, but his book was a sore disappointment. I waited excitedly for this book to come out. When I was done all I could say was that I would not recommend it to others. The story was weak. She described everything to death and forgot to tell a good story."
positive,"the film version won a lot of oscars...: but the book is the way to go...the unofficial ""biography"" of louisiana governor huey long....i read this book when i was a senior in college; it is one of those books that makes you glad you love reading and will deepen your appreciation of literature... willie stark started out wanting to do good for the people but was destroyed by his ulterior motives and treachery... the story of jack burden is equally fascinating as it sometimes paralells stark's, but takes twists and turns all its own...even if you don't love politics, you'll still love this book...the perfect graph for understanding human nature and for finding out why people do dirt..."
positive,"A must read: My brother who works for another airline recommended this book. I don't follow the industry so I'd never heard of Gordon Bethune, but I have now! Every leader should take the time to travel with and steal priceless leadership nuggets from Gordon as he took Continental airline from worst to first."
positive,"The Greatest Generation: On the chapter about Lloyd Kilmer, there is a picture titled ""Liberation Day"". The photo was dated April 29, 1945. I help a gentleman by the name of Roy Sage. He is in this photo. Is there a way to make contact with any of the other soldiers? I believe this would make Mr. Sage very happy.Thanks for a great book, it brings joy to many.Marlese"
negative,Long and not very interesting: This period piece seems to run on forever. The characters establish themselves well enough but there is no compelling story to grab our attention. The sets also had a fake look to them - I don't think this was filmed on location. It felt like I was watching a stage rendition of Paris - it's hard to figure out what's wrong but the whole hting looks fake and not very well done.
positive,This was a present for my husband: My husband said that they shoe is very comfortable and he would buy them again. I thought the price was very reasonable
positive,Good Price: Good price and arrived as expected. The subscription feature is a good option for this type of item of course.
positive,"Large!: Ordered through Amazon prime. Item arrived on time in perfect condition.You may not realize this product is HUGE! It's nearly the size of a container of oatmeal! VERY reasonable for the price, especially considering how much this stuff costs in a small spice container from whole foods.This is my first experience with nutritional yeast. The taste by itself kind of reminds me of those mystery fried chips you get at fairs sometimes.The product was sealed and even I could tell it was very fresh.I'd buy again."
negative,"This book is Rubbish!: This book is not based on sound acting principles. It directs teachers to ask students to play emotions rather than objectives, thus breaking one of the cardinal rules of acting. Once I saw this, I refused to read on and immediately returned the book. It literally made me physically ill to read this book."
positive,"Very well written: This is the second book I have read by Kaku. I really enjoy his writing style, it's aimed at the layperson(me). Some of the theories boggle my mind, but help me expand my knowledge of theoretical physics and the universe as a whole. Some reviews mention that this book is obsolete being written in '95, but I like read the older theories to see where the physics of today have come from. Bottom line, if you have curiosity about theoretical physics but not a degree you will probably enjoy this book."
negative,"Does not work properly, COMPANY NO HELP: The DVD maker is easy to setup but the one I have doesn't work properly. While converting: I am getting interference from the unit on both the TV and computer (which shows up on the copy), there is a 1/8 inch distortion at the bottom of the preview screen (also shows up on the copy), and the sound is not in sync. I tried to contact the company by phone and left messages instructed with no call back from them. Sent an email to tech support that went unanswered too. Finally contacted someone at the company, explained my problems, returned the unit as per instructions for repair, received it back after 3 weeks and it still doesn't work. Contacted tec support again and was told to download updated program(I had the latest version installed) did so anyway without any better results. My suggestion is to pass on this unit."
negative,"Overrated: I bought this, with the hope that it would be able to jump start my car if needed. I had been having some battery problems, so I bought this. I charged it as the directions indicated in the User's Guide directed, then I checked it and it displayed 100% full. I needed to jump my battery and I followed the directions in the User Guide, and it would not work. The light came on on the powerpack, BUT it would not jump start my car. I returned it, and will try another one. I might have gotten a defective unit, and I realize that, but I will not be buying another one of these from Xantrex."
positive,Very helpful: Very helpful product but you need to study it deeply and not just once to get the results. I highly recommend the book.
positive,"Hottest ticket in town: WE have a 10 month old who has had this attached to his crib from day one. The music tells him that it is bedtime, after the bottle and cd playing through. Now that he can sit and stand in the bed, he keeps hitting his head on the start button. We travel often back to Bethlehem, PA to visit and this is almost the first item packed. Very cool and truly a lifesaver."
positive,"my review: This is a true story about an ex-Tobacco executive who is cohersed into revealing secrets from his job. The Tobacco company where he used to work has made his life, as well as his family's a living hell. He fights back.This is a very gripping movie. The acting is done exceptionally well by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe, as well as Christopher Plummer. The plot is very well adapted, making it very easy to watch.Good movie, very good acting. A must see."
negative,"Frustrating Garbage: I bought this machine in December of 2009. 13 months TO THE DAY it died. Water won't pump out of the resevoir into the machine and the digital display looks like something from another planet, no discernable words or letters or numbers. I called Keurig who told me that my warranty was only for 12 months so I was pretty much out of luck. My husband, who is very handy, took the machine apart to see what was wrong with it and he found faulty celluloids and rust on the inside of the machine. I called Keurig back and they said that while they understood my issue with their $170 coffee maker, even if I hadn't been out of warranty, taking it apart was a warranty breaker. Huh? I will NEVER buy anything from this company again and am now buying the Cuisinart. It might not be a stylish, but at least they stand by their products."
negative,"Felt as tho it was made of plastic.: I recommend this product to no one because it was essentially plastic. It felt like it was throw together in and hour. The ""metal part"" bends too easy as it will break. If you want to truly cosplay, this is not the right headband. I tried bending it to make it look like my cosplay and it was terrible."
negative,"Doesn't lock well: The accuracy of the rule and ruggedness of construction seem satisfactory. Unfortunately the lock mechanism doesn't work well, the rule moves when pushed even when the rule is locked tightly. I cannot tighten the lock enough to keep the rule from moving when it is forcefully pressured."
positive,Cheaper by the Dozen: This book is about a family called the Gilbreths finding the best way to live. They have 12 children. All these children care for many different things and are different ages.They face many differnt obstacles. This family probably is like yours but maybe a little more funnier. You'll laugh by reading this book. The movie is a little differnt from the book. There are two versions of Cheaper by the Dozen. Reading this book will definately remind you of families and your own family. So if your ready for some laughs read Cheaper by the Dozen. If you liked the movie you'll love the book.
positive,"excellent voice, very good writer: this cd is full of the classic power pop ethic-bittersweet lyrics, lilting melodies, just enough grit to balance out the sweetness, and just enough odd to make up for the tame qualities of certain songs. church's subsequent recordings are much better [see jealousy records, cdbaby.com, notlame records] than this, especially in the area of production, as this cd sounds a bit tinny. but, for the most part, the songs are there, most notably ""look out, you've got it made"", ""lost is lost"", and the strange, rollicking ""sacred cow/caving in"". for fans of gin blossoms, tommy keene, goo goo dolls."
negative,"simple but scary: If I didn't know any better, I would think that this album was put together in a day as an afterthought. I've always been a firm believer in simplicity, but I have also been a firm believer in talent, which in the case of Moby, is nonexistant. If become a recording ""artist"" is this easy, what the heck an I doing? ""Run On"" should of been the name of all the songs."
negative,HO HUM: I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A WHOLE LOT BETTER.THE MAN THING THAT BUGGED ME IS STURAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CHILD MOUSE SO WHY USE A ADULTS VOCIE. THERE WAS ONE PART A LIKED THOUGH ANDD THAT WAS THE PART WHEN THE ONE CAT SMILED AND SAID PLEASE. ALSO WHY DOES EVERY THINK JOTHAN LIPNICK IS SO CUTE. HE NOT THAT GREAT.
negative,"It blow out the first time I used it: This was my second battery charger for this drill and I have had enough. When I tested my battery with my volt meter it tested okay so I started charging it about fifteen minutes later ""pop"" now the charger is dead. I bought an electric drill, and said forget it."
negative,"completely predictable: i couldn't finish this book. it was too predictable, which made it very boring. i don't like to read books that remind me of other books. this is one. save your money, it's not a good book. nice cover though."
negative,"Poor Quality Inside: Ordered this as a gift for my brother. Upon arrival, he opened it to find the insert was completely pulled away from the case in several places. I was watching on skype as he showed me the several locations where the linig wasn't attached as it should be. He will be returning this item and I'm very upset that he ended up with such a cheaply made gift for his birthday."
positive,"You will be glad you read it!: I didn't know what to expect when I started out. John Grisham has never written a bad book...only great ones and even greater ones! The Last Juror is not an exception.The characters were real and the storyline was believable. In his true writing style, Grisham did a supurb job of telling the story. This is one of those books you really don't want to finish!The beginning is fast...the middle is steady...and the ending is wonderful!I won't give it away here. I'll just challenge the reader to pick it up, read it for five minutes, and just try to put it down!Buster WasdenAlbany, Ga"
negative,"REVISED EDITION UPDATE:: Paramount has now informed customers that the new revised Blu-ray with the vastly improved HD transfer WILL have a YELLOW UPC symbol on the packaging, as was the case with Saving Private Ryan. Amazon.com needs to re-confirm if they have the NEW stock here!"
positive,"This is an amazing cd!!: This is my all time favorite CD. It is beautiful. All of these women have incredible voices and this CD is great becauase it has 5 of the best voices (and Carole King who is a fantastic songwriter) in music singing their greatest hits!! I have 5 Celine Dion Cd's, 1 Gloria Estefan, 1 Shania Twain, 4 Mariah Carey and 1 Aretha Franklin Cd and I still bought this CD!! It is 10 times better than Diva's Live 99!! This Cd will be am asset to anyones collection! The duets and the group songs are beautiful. BUY THIS CD!!"
negative,"Cheapy: Within a few days of wearing this watch the star studs started falling out. A few months after owning the watch the three fell off inside the glass. I barely wore the watch after two studs fell out. It is sweet looking when it first arrives, but keep an eye out for silver star studs falling out if you ever where it."
negative,"Above Average Bob Hope Movie - LOUSY DVD!: This review refers to the Alpha (Gotham Distribution, as listed on Amazon) version of this movie on DVD. The print used for this DVD is absolutely horrible. The opening credits are barely readable, and the movie itself looks murky and has tons of scratches and dust. It's a shame that Alpha couldn't find a better print, but from some of the reviews I've read it seems that some other companies have had the same problem. It would be better not to release it at all than to use such a bad print. This is a really fun movie, and it deserves a lot better than this. Wait for a cleaner copy to surface - one will eventually."
positive,"Almost perfect: I needed vents for my observation hive. I would have preferred something a bit smaller made of brass, but this is the best I could find. Keeping my fingers crossed, I ordered these up. After assembly of the hive, I found that they actually look pretty good and they do provide the ventilation required for the hive. The louver spacing is also small enough to prevent unintended escapes. A 1"" wood auger makes a hole perfect for proper fit. They are well made and the price is right."
positive,"Awesome: Just what I needed. Works flawless. Perfect price. Will always look to Amazon for EVERYTHING first! An excellant assortment of cables, accessories, etc. at a great price."
positive,"Looks great and works well too!: This is a replacement unit for my Keurig B60 which started leaking after 8 months of use. The new B70 works great and is much quieter! My only gripe (and it's a minor one) is that the base does not sit flat on the counter top. There is a bit of wobble due to the layout of the rubber feet on the bottom.Aside from that, great coffee maker."
positive,"this cd is tight: this cd has some real good beats and lyrics. Everybody that likes No Limit needs to go get, its worth all the money,"
negative,copycat: While the story kept me turning pages I kept feeling as if I where reading a poor reproduction of Robert Jordan's THE WHEEL OF TIME. Similarities range from the shape of the land on the map to the capabilities of the main character. Too many typical fantasy words crammed into every sentence give the impression of a high school writer getting carried away on a free writing exercise. Nothing special here other than the authors age...and it shows.
negative,Slow service!!!!!!: It took almost a month to get the book and it was not quite what I expected. I was hoping for a fun book to read and its borderline boring!!
positive,mitford years are the best: All of Jan Karon's Mitford books are great! I have read all of them - in order :) They are feel good books with a good message and story backing.
positive,"good: the book arrived in the right time. thank you. by the way, i hope you can create faster ways to international deliveries."
negative,"lack of research: I listened to the whole unabrigdged book to try to understand why this book would get published. I belive it is the worst book of its genre that I have listened to on CD or read.There are several femal author's to choose from. Don't choose Ms. Rosenberg.Sullivan's Law (Rosenberg, Nancy Taylor)"
positive,"Friendship is forever!: I suggest this book, it is simply another great stories from Stephen King, kind of diferent from his field, but still amazing.It is the story about a group of childhood friends that have some paranormal powers, and they got in the way of a kind of desease that it is cuase by Aliens. They gather their power to solve the mistery behind this invasion.In this book you will feel the love that this childhood friend have from each other, specially with Doddit."
positive,Best Calcium Supplement!: I'm very happy with this product because it has all the right vitamins in the right ratios to increase the bioavailability of the calcium. It's also a great price. Thanks!
negative,"Mising Information/Incomplete: This is one of my all time favorite books but;This Kindle version is missing very important parts to the story. Every time a letter or newspaper is read it is left blank. The whole story is based on the information in the letter and newspaper clippings. They are missing in this edition, even as a previous fan of the story I am having some difficulty in following along. If you are not familiar with the story you will be completely lost."
negative,Works: It was a bit confusing to assemble. Had to redo a few times before I got the right rods with the right utensils. In the end you get what you paid for - bottom of the line product for cheap.
positive,"Love It: I've seen a marked difference of pain from when I first started using it over a month ago. I don't have bad bunions, just the beginning of one and my shoes on my right foot always cause it to hurt, even my running shoes. But after continually using it, I've noticed a decrease and in some cases disappearance of pain in the joint. Love this product, would highly recommend it"
positive,"A Delight!: Once again, Alice Hoffman has given us a delightfully charming story that starts out as a fairy tale and becomes true life extraordinary. Her books are so magical,that once you begin, you are caught in a spell that doesn't allow you to put down the book until the last page has been turned."
negative,"Not a lot to recommend.: This series is my first experience reading Moorcock. I am usually an avid reader, but I kept finding myself making excuses to do anything except get back to this book. The characters lack sympathy and depth. There are plenty of battles, but the plot stringing them together feels stale and sketchy. I'll probably finish the series out of sheer stubbornness, but I wouldn't recommend this book or the series to someone who is not already a fan of the author."
positive,"Owned the 10mm one for 3 years now and still love it: I love this mat. Still sticky, and in great shape after 3 years. Bonus: no nasty synthetic smells.I do take good care of it:It never gets put away damp.I don't use it outdoors.I don't leave it in a locker or unbreathable bag.These are biodegradable mats, so you should treat them with a bit of common sense to ensure that they last (I think 3 years and going strong is pretty good!)"
positive,"Good product with an added bonus . . .: One unexpected benefit of these headphones is that with the noise-cancelling on, my hearing aid does not feed back. With most headphones, I have to turn down the hearing aid I wear in one ear to avoid feedback from the headphone cup. And so the music in that ear is much quieter. With this set (and perhaps other noise cancelling phones), I can leave the volume up on the earpiece, and I get a much more balanced audio experience than otherwise."
positive,Ten stars!: I am crazy about this cd. I got it today. Thanks Amazon for your quick service. My favorite songs are Perfect Day and Shine. They are brilliant songs with a beautiful message. Clay's voice soars in strength and sicerity. Don't miss this album!
negative,The Worst Die hard.: This is the worst of the 3. Not very entertaing and the effects really suck. It seems that they wanted to make a little more money off the first. Even bruce willis hated this. The thired on is alittle better because they actually took some time to make a villian. skip this one and go see Live Free or Die Hard in theaters June 27th 2007.
positive,three's company: this is one of the best comedy ever in the world tv until now i am still watching this comedy every time
positive,"Great Book for Young Women: Excellent work by a woman writer who is also the daughter of Madam Curie. I would recommend this book to all young women. It is an excellent account of a great woman who made a mark on history when (supposedly) women had little freedom or power. Miss Curie (the writer) exhibits a great deal of love and devotion to her mother, yet remains objective."
negative,Beware: Buyers should beware of this video since it is of very poor quality being taken from a less than perfect 16mm. print. We are accustomed to much better prints these days and this one is being sold under false pretence.
positive,"Great book for low price: Book came in great condition, paid low price.A necessity for young or old interested in understanding the Lutheran faith."
negative,"Here they go again .: If you have heard any Rolling Stones album that hey have put out in the past 30 years,you have heard this.When oh when are they going to give up the ghost? If you have to buy a Stones album,go with something pre 1973."
positive,Megaman PET: This toy is so cool its the best toy I have ever had and i'm 11I think evryone should get one so there would be alot of kids you could battle with
negative,"I 'm a Grisham fan. This is not his best work.: I didn't connect with any of the characters. He didn't give me a reason to. There was one point where I thought I might connect with Callie, but it never happened. Grisham wasn't sure where he wanted this story to go, so he rambled on for 355 pages with laws from the 70's that were or were not true; elections that I could care less about because there wasn't a reason to care; he threw in a ""walmart"" taking over the town; a nude sniper. Although I finished the book, on several occasions, I found myslef asking ""why am I wasting my time reading this book?"" A waste it is."
negative,"Buyers Beware!!!!!!!!!: This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!"
positive,"Love this show!: I love this show, I bought this season to complete my collection. They have made the boxed set boxes a lot smaller in size over time, but still packed with all the great episodes of this fantastic show!"
positive,Good book: This is a good book. It is sad that many of Tess bad decisions caused her life to be worst off than it should have been. Instead of making lemonade from her lemons in life life she continued to suck on the sour sour fruit over and over again.
negative,"Too small and stained: I ordered this for my average sized 8 year old. I purchased the medium (size 8-10) and it is way too small. It's too short, tight around the shoulders, the boot covers don't cover her foot and the mask won't go around her head (not even close and again she's 50%ile in both height & weight for her age). This size would be better for a 5 year old! And if that isn't bad enough, the cape has a dark (non-removable) stain on it! I'm hoping I can return it w/o paying for shipping considering this item is damaged."
positive,"good quality but expensive: my husband prefers these blades but at over $2 per blade, they're not cheap! perhaps each blade will last a little longer than the standard blades."
negative,"Poor Transfer: I just watched my Blu-Ray version of The Mummy and was very disappointed. The definition was almost indistinguishable from the DVD! If you're looking for eye-popping high resolution, this movie doesn't deliver. It looks like standard definition. Don't believe me? Try it yourself. Bummer."
negative,"Might be better for minivans or SUVs: Bought this to take two bikes on a road-trip. Rack did fit nicely on the bumper of my car and didn't leave any scratches. If you own any sort of sedan though beware. This rack places the bike(s) above the height of the car, so not only is it difficult to lift up, but is a killer of gas mileage too. Despite being in the Saris fit guide, my Kia Rio had a drop of around 10mpg and I was travelling slow. I placed the rack on a large domestic sedan and it fit about the same, very high above the car. Apparently it is only meant for mountain bikes with wide tubes as I needed to place rags around the bike tubes on my 3 speed and hybrid in order to prevent slipping. Still the bikes did encounter a few scratches once I reached my destinations. I ended up returning the rack to Amnazon without hassle and bought the Thule Speedway which fits much lower on my car and the bikes fit on it properly."
negative,"Totally Wasted my Money: I've been using Amazon for years and this is the first time I've left a comment because I hope that you won't waste your money like I did. I have 2 sons. My baby uses the Swaddlers and my toddler uses Cruisers. When Cruisers was unavailable online, I thought, the Baby Dry can't be that much different, they both are made by Pampers, right? WRONG!! I have been washing wet bed sheets and pjs every single morning for 2 weeks since my toddler used the Baby Dry. It can not hold anything. I had my son pee in a clean Baby Dry standing straight, waited for a minute, then took the diaper off. The pee was dripping out from the diaper. It was the worst diaper we have ever tried. I heard that Pampers changed the Cruisers to be thinner as well. I am giving Huggies a try now. Though it was not as soft as Pampers, I have not need to wash the wet bed sheet or pjs for the past week. Now I have a big box of Baby Dry diapers sitting in my garage that I can't decided if I should donate..."
negative,"Uhh yea right: I downloaded it for free courtny, then i kept the new songs then deleted the rest..thank for this waster of plastic tho.."
negative,"Card Failure: Bought in May 2000 (same month produced) - used 3 months, then went away for year. Returned in Oct. of 2001. In December G3 card failed after only 6 months of use on a $1600+ set. Card is about $400 plus labor of about $300. Quite a bill for a $1600 TV set used 6 months. When working liked picture quality, ease of operation, and overall look for average size family. Really disappointed in Sony - thought we were buying quality product that would last for years."
positive,"One hundred stars...: ...would not be enough for this extraordinary treasure trove of intelligence and beauty. You get to see Gould in real time, talking at length about the music that meant everything to him -- not just Bach and Schoenberg, but Richard Strauss. Mahler, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Beethoven, among others. These are complete programs, so you get to marvel not only at the transcendent performances but at the ease with which Gould enters into, say, a Bach fugue, whether for a few measures or for the entire piece, and then reemerges to deliver some extraordinary insight in a mannered but impeccable spoken prose... This set is the bargain of the century at the present amazon price ($72.99) but even if it goes back up to list price the decision to buy this would be a no-brainer. Wow."
negative,"Too melodramatic: This novel is written in very interesting and compelling prose, but its characters are hardly worth the effort. The charaters are obsessive bores that can only be compared to day time soap opera characters. After reading through half of this novel, I was so numb from the constant tragedy and melodrama, that I simply did not care what happened to the characters anymore. To make matters worse, the plot is extremely complicated and very difficult to follow, with new characters added every chapter.The most amazing thing about this book is its popularity and that it helped its author win the nobel prize."
positive,"An interesting book: This is the thirteenth book in Terry Pratchett's series on the Discworld--a flat world, supported on the back of four massive elephants riding on the back of a planet-sized turtle, anything hilarious can happen here, and eventually does.Brutha is a novice in the temple of Om, and he thought that things were very settled. And then one day he actually heard the voice of Om. (""Psst!"") It seems that true belief in Om has been declining for years, and as such his power has waned until he found himself trapped in the likeness of a tortoise! But this revelation is going to turn the entire church of Om upside-down...starting with Brutha.Overall, I found this to be an interesting book. As with so many of Terry Pratchett's book, this one is both entertaining and quite thought provoking. As an added bonus, this book marks the first appearance of the interesting History Monks!"
negative,"Do Not Buy This: the description stated that this item was: Headband's metal plate size is 6""L x 2""H and that it was an Official Naruto headband. what i received was not what was pictured or described. i measured the metal plate and it came to 4""L x 1.5""H and definitely did not match my other official Naruto headband that i do have. I was hoping to use this for a cosplay that is coming up very soon but i cant now because the item is not what was pictured or described, so now i have to go through the difficulty of finding another one and hoping that its the real thing and not a bootleg like this one. i will not be buying from this seller again. i also recommend to all of you that see this and think its a good deal to just stay away and not buy this bootlegged fake."
positive,"I love Flirting: I love this movie. It's a charming, delightful and wonderful little known gem. Thandie Newton is beautiful, Noah Taylor is endearing. A great script. One of the most romantic little films I've ever seen. Lets not forget Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts are also in this film."
positive,"I Told You About Strawberry Fields...: This CD is something of a paradox. This contains some of their most majestic songs that they've ever made (Strawberry Fields, I Am The Walrus) on one hand. On the other, it was intended by Capitol to be a package containing the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack and some of their recent singles that had not yet shown up on album format. In CD form, it still is found lacking. The original album booklet appears in a much truncated form. Also, the sound could use some upgrading, perhaps in a similar way to the recent Yellow Submarine songtrack. They might wish to add some bonus tracks, as there are other versions of I Am The Walrus, Penny Lane, etc, that are known to exist. I grade this CD 5 stars on the basis of Strawberry Fields Forever alone, one of the greatest songs ever written by John Lennon. Goo goo g'joob."
positive,"Album of the Year: System of a Down's s/t debut was an album that totally blew me away. It is among my top 10 fav. albums of all time. That was the year 1998, and it has been 3 years since SOAD has blessed us with their musical goodness, and now 3 years later SOAD has dropped Toxicity. Toxicity has picked up right where s/t left off. The same unexpected time changes and death-metal-like intensity is what SOAD is all about. Serj is sounding better than ever with his distinct hardcore growls, and Daron Malakian returns as one of the industry's most talented guitarists. Toxicity is the album of the year....plain and simple...nothing will top this album.Tracks of note--- Prison Song, Needles, Deer Dance, Chop Suey! ATWA, Science, Toxicity, Psycho and Ariels"
positive,"Hurray for a protagonist such as Festina Ramos!: I found this book by luck; it was misplaced on a bookstore shelf. First, I liked the use of a person of color as the protagonist: someone who just happens not to be white. Second, I found the planet Melaquin, and its native inhabitants, uniquely intriguing. The only part I found difficult to buy is her ""deformity."" I, too, am a woman with a port-wine stain on my face, and I've never thought of it as a deformity. I've never tried to hide it. Perhaps hers (I can't recall) was over more of her face than mine. Nevertheless, I was sorry to get to the end of the book. It gave me the same kind of strong-woman-on-a-harrowing- adventure-pleasure as the movie ""Aliens 2"" did. I want more of same."
positive,This blue-ray is wonderful...: Porcupine Tree is amazing! Essential for anyone who likes rock and roll.Anesthetize (DVD + Blu-ray)
positive,"Magnificent Accomplishment: This is one of those beautiful moments. You know Dolly has been kicking around major labels like a tennis ball. You know that women singers past 40 rarely get airplay. You know Dolly is a wonderful singer whose creative potential has not lessened. You bring home her latest CD on the smaller North Carolina-based Sugar Hill label; and you wonder if her recording career will be reduced to small independent releases. Then you put on the disc. Wow! I like Dolly's philosophy: When all else fails, make one of the best albums of your career. This album is nearly flawless. The steller bluegrass players lend an integrity and enthusiasm which keeps taking Dolly even higher. The songs of spiritual faith are transcendent and not preachy. This is a magnificent accomplishment. If you've like Dolly or bluegrass music, don't miss this marriage of the two. Unforgettable!"
negative,"The name implies action/suspense, not comedy!: I feel that The Mummy, just the name itself implies an action thriller. The special effects were good, but that doesn't make a movie good. The storyline was ok, but the persistent comedy was annoying. Not that it wasn't funny, but when I go to see a movie called ""The Mummy"", you would think its an indiana jones type thriller. Indiana jones had comical moments, but nothing like in the mummy. Overall, the comedy detracted from the quality of the movie as a whole."
negative,"Couldn't get past the profanity...: I got this book thinking it would be about...of all things - COOKING. Well, unfortunately Julie Powell felt the need to ""liven it up"" with so much profanity I couldn't even get through this book. Very disappointing. This is not a sweet book, this is not about cooking so much as it's about Julie finding more ways to include the ""F"" word into every day language. Don't let the cover fool you. This book is awful."
negative,"DO NOT BUY IF YOU USE WINDOWS 98SE!!!!!!!!: This product does not support the ID tags for your WMA files in Win98 SE, so you are not able to sort by album, artist or genre. D-link's tech support has no fix for this, and will tell you to run Windows Media Connect, which is not available for Windows 98. Your only option if you have WMA files is to convert them to MP3's."
positive,"Great speakers: These are great speakers for the price. The only reason I gave this system 4 stars is that there is no option to turn off or lower the bass on the sub. This can be somewhat inconvenient depending on what you need them for. Besides that, great system."
negative,"A HUGE waste of money!!: Hey people..those of you who feel compelled to either dis or defend this album based on comments the woman may or may not have made in an interview or concert...it has no place here. This is to reveiw the album. So, that said....this was by far the worst $13 I've ever spent. I literally threw it on the shelf after one listen and I'm sure I'll never bother again. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. The Grammy's should be ashamed of themselves for being bullied into handing out awards to be ""politically correct"". Can you say ""Milli Vanilli""? Ugh...this album could signal the downfall of western civilization and true art. Bad...bad...bad."
negative,"Oh please: I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all."
positive,"Great Documentary About Japanese Counter Culture: I found this fascinating. It's a lifestyle I didn't even know existed. There's an ethereal quality to the main characters and I found the overall ambiance of this film to be wistful and poignant. It's about male escorts and their interplay with their ""clients"". It's worth noting that men don't appear to be able to emotionally handle this trade any better than women do. I may go back and watch it again now that it's been a few years."
negative,"Worst dating book ever: This is the worst dating book ever for catholics. The author believes that dating should be mechanical and leaves little space for God's grace and healing.And you are to kiss once you get married not before. Perhaps it's an american custom as the author is american. Avoid at all costs, it was a waste of money. Better get 'The Question' rather than this book."
negative,"One of the worst movies EVER !!!!: I don't get it. How can anybody give this miscreation of a film more than 1, maybe 2 stars? I expected to see a funny, original film but instead got to see some of the worst screenwriting ever. The plot is just plain awful.The sets and costumes were beautifully done, the acting wasn't bad, but that's not enough to save this #@%$(* of a film."
positive,"incredible: Red Storm Rising is definately one of my favorite books. I have read it three times, and I still find myself unable to put it down. The world is faced with a situation, that the Soviets were in fact fully capable of winning. The book gives an excellent view of modern warfare through the eyes of the two greatest superpowers the world has known. I would recommend this book for anyone. Thank you Tom Clancy!"
negative,"Piece of junk, stay away: This item had lots of promise, but it falls completely flat.I purchased the item, followed the instructions to install it, after I restarted my windows 2000 system twice, it didn't work. It kept resetting my powered USB hub.Turns out, this device does *NOT* adhere to the USB specs ... and does not work if plugged into a USB hub.I called thier tech support people, and was told that they only support a configuration where the devices is plugged directly into the USB port of the computer, no hubs.Unforunately, for me, that's not an option ... the USB on my system is way in the back and I don't want to be reaching back there to swap USB devices around."
negative,"drys my skin out: I liked this face wash the first 2 times I used it but after that I found it very drying. I have pretty sensitive skin, especially in the winter, and I found I had to use twice as much moisturizer after washing my face with this or my face would burn the rest of the day. I'm sure it'll be better once the weather gets warmer. In the mean time I am using it sparingly."
negative,I've heard better from lesser knowns.: Just goes to show that it's publicity that builds record sales and not necessarily talent. Not a standout by any means.
positive,Wonderful Snippets of Life: Alice Munro was recommended to me as a master of the short story form and I was not disappointed. This collection is wonderfully deep and complex - simple and ordinary on the surface but seething with subtle passion beneath.Her ability to shift time and viewpoint is effective and powerful.Highly recommended.
positive,tremendous classic: What a great experience...I re-read this classic that I first read as a small child...What can you say to improve on a great classic?? Tremendous book...I recommend it highly....
negative,"Low Budget Foreign Film: It's bad when someone in the USA gets a camcorder and decides to make a backyard movie with garage style props. It's downright painful when someone in another country does the same and then inflicts on you the need to ""Read"" the movie to get to the end. This movie would have been far more enjoyable had the producers dubbed the film in english and then allowed the film to be ""Riffed"" for some humor. If you are looking for a Sci Fi flick this is not it! Move on the next film in your list."
negative,"Don't bother: I thought Pampers were Pampers. I was so wrong. Pampers Dry Baby diapers are very thin and when soiled are completely saturated with waste. I change my baby about every 20-30 minutes when he's up and these diapers are awful. Overnight they are not even close to adequate, they stink & leak up his back. Just don't bother and get Swaddlers instead. 2 stars because I got them for 16 cents each with Amazon Mom. I now have 253 diapers to get rid of because I wanted to save some $."
positive,I loved it: Being that I saw this movie before it was a must for me to get this movie ! so now i haVe it and enjoying it the case was perfect the Dvd was perfect quality !
positive,"Great power metal!!!: Very catchy, ambitious and intelligent lyrics. This guys are awesome, with tight musicianship and perfect vocals. My version is without de DVD, and i'm a little dissapointed about that, just for this. Recommended if you like Gamma Ray and Primal Fear."
negative,"Forget Mr. Heat Miser: Somehow we missed the fact that The Year Without A Santa Claus isn't actually in this collection; instead of the classic animated version, there is a garish live action film. Since Disc 2 was completely replaced by the live action piece, all of the classics that are mentioned on the packaging are missing: The Year Without A Santa Claus, Rudolph's Shiny New Year,and Nestor, The Long Eared Christmas Donkey."
positive,"Good solid advice: Excellent primer for new business and reference for those a few years in. I found it covered most topics of interest except state taxes, which in the DC/MD/VA area is still a mystery to me."
negative,"Only For Students of the Novel.: This was the first book I had to read for the history of the novel in college. While I was working my way through this, I wondered if the rest of the class would be this slow. Moll does not command respect, pity or admiration. The scenes for the most part are not really memorable, and the supporting characters are not really convincing. Perhaps this is my biggest complaint. Charles Dickens can keep my interest even in an 800 page book. Yet Defoe could not hold my interest in 250 pages. The only reason I could give for reading this is that it shows a primitave stage in the development of the novel."
negative,"Bad OCR: The book is not bad, but the Kindle version is full of typos, about one per screenful. I'm guessing the book was OCRd badly. The result is hard to read."
positive,"Narnia 2: This movie did not capture the magic of the first, but the more times I have watched it, I have enjoyed it more. The focus should be on Lucy following Aslan, yet this is a very good sequel."
positive,not what i was looking for but the information was usefull: I was looking to implement custom firmware and as result this book was not theanswer instead other supplementary programs to make the psp more useful then justgaming.
negative,"Don't Go There: Despite the great rating and rave reviews, I curse the day I brought this one home. I have gone through at least a ream of paper in the three weeks I have had this printer--not because I am so productive, but because the paper jams so often and the printer actually shreds the paper as it tries to eject. Several cries for help and complaints to HP customer service resulted in ""that's a common problem. The arm doesn't detract after each page. You will have to manually reset the arm whenever that happens."" So far, that means 6-8 times per day. No more HP for me! This is my second bad experience. You would think I would have learned by now."
negative,"Evil, Self-Mutilation, Vomiting, Defecation, Oral Sex, Abuse: Here's my review: In this video your children WILL SEE: Marilyn Manson rubbing a Bible on his naked crotch; Marilyn Manson mutilating himself by cutting his chest with broken beer bottles; A band member vomiting back stage; A band member forking a piece of excrement; Marilyn Manson performing oral sex on his (male) lead guitarist? They will hear a woman being abused. She was actually being abused or she was the best actress on the planet. They will see hate and agression, all in the creative guise of free speech - you couldn't call it entertainment. Oh yeah, there was some music in there too.It's America and he has the right to do so, to do so doesn't make it right."
positive,"Where fact and fiction merge: This book is a well written alternate version of WWII. The fiction is blended so well with fact that it is hard to tell the difference. The characters are developed well and there is a great amount of carry over between the books in the series of events and conversations. Set against the backdrop of WWII, the story begins as the ""Lizards"" show up for their conquest and colonization of earth. Unfortunately for them, their reconnaissance probe took 1000 years to transverse the distance to and from their planet and earth. In the time since, mankind has made just a few improvements to the weapons of war. What follows is a story line filled with enough plots and subplots to satisfy all of the readers' sci-fi cravings. Buy the hardback - you'll want to read it again."
positive,It actually works: This is a great book to understand why your baby is fussy. This book has some very good recommendations on how to help your baby sleep better and there is more than one way to do it. There are several strategies and you pick and choose which will work for your baby. I follow the 2-hour window rule and it worked like a charm. My son sleeps 12 hours at night and naps 3 times during the day for 1-2 hours. This book has really helped me sleep train my son.
positive,"Simply Great A+: This is the best Techno CD you are ever going to find,Scooter brings the Old Euro-Techno back on the European Top Charts once more,if you are a techno fan you will love this no doubt.Get his now."
positive,"Perfect Bridesmaid Dress!!!: Honestly, I don't see how this dress could get anything other than 5 stars. For starters, it's at least half the price of ANY boutique bridesmaid dress (it's almost the spitting image of a David's Bridal dress I saw in the exact same color and style for $135). Second, they DO run big, but my bm's got alterations for 25 dollars or less and that's STILL cheaper than boutiques. Third, they're very high quality, boning for support, and just so darn pretty! (My bms wore the aqua dress in the customer photos). Thanks Pacific Plex!!!"
negative,"Don't bother: Imagine John Lennon's nonsense lyrics for ""I am a walrus"" going on for hundreds of pages. I think maybe a hundred or so people in the entire world might enjoy digging through this but the rest of us can put this one aside. Don't fall for that snobby ""Well, it's not for lazy or stupid people"" nonsense. This is nothing more than a self absorbed word puzzle for those who do not have lives to live but have plenty of time to waste deciphering this. Maybe, one day, if I am ever in a crippling accident and am confined to a wheelchair with little to do but figure this one out, I might attempt reading through it again. Everyone else, stay away!!"
negative,"WAY TOO SMALL: dont be fooled, it is barely an inch big, the picture will decieve you!!! A complete waste of 12 buckks!"
negative,"Ok: These water bottles definitely have the right price, but that's about where the good things end.The mounting accessory provided... I have no idea what I was supposed to do with it - and it came with no instructions. I couldn't get it to fit on any of the three bikes I bought one for, and eventually just zip-tied the holder onto the bikes instead. Which worked fine, until I realized that these bottles must be leaking something into the water. Leave the water in the bike for a few hours, and it's tastes TERRIBLE, almost tastes like sewer water. It's awful.So, while the price is certainly right, not much else about these bottles is."
negative,"great coffee & simple to use but product doesn't last: Well our 4th platinum keurig bit the dust today. The past three have been covered under the 1 year warranty. This one is a month and a half past warranty...I imagine we're stuck. Will call them later to see. We brew two cups of coffee every morning and sporadically will heat water for hot choc. or tea. We do keep it on so the nice blue light stays lit....maybe that is whats killing the motor. We also use a reverse osmosis system to fill it so I don't believe build up is happening. Sad, because I love the coffee and idea but product definitely has a flaw."
negative,"Skip it!!: Chris Paolini and Robert Stanek must be friends. They write alike, they're stories are so similar. Both heroes even eventually go off to the land of the elves. How stupid is that?"
positive,Good book: I love Sylvia's books. There are a lot of interesting facts that I've tried to find out more details. I was recommended this book to people who looking answers on their questions.
positive,"Great diapers for cheap!: This diaper is the cheapest brand name diapers I can find when you buy them in bulk and use Amazon's subscription program. It works great for my now 6 month old. He started out with swaddlers when he was a newborn. I switched to baby-dry when he turned 3 month. This diaper barely leaks. Only time it leaked was when he slept too long and I forgot to change him when he got fed once. It was over 12hrs, so I'm sure no other diaper could do any better.Some might not agree this is not the cheapest, but when I was searching for new diaper, this Economy pack for subscription price was the cheapest (per diaper price). I even compared with other brands and from stores like Sam's club. It is really convenient to use subscription service for diaper. I don't have to go to the store, and if I don't need one on certain month, I can just skip that month's shippment."
negative,"Waste of money - Omega 3 oil... Snake oil: After taking Thera Tears Omega-3 supplements for 3 months straight along with the Thera Tears eye drops, there has been absolutely no change in my eye dryness or redness. I purchased after reading overwhelmingly positive reviews on multiple sites, but considering that this is nothing more than 1.2g of fat and after noticing no effect myself, I believe this product is just another snake oil/placebo. Don't waste your money.As far as an omega-3 supplement, you can get about the same amount of omega-3 in Now's supplement for half the price and twice the quantity."
positive,"FROM BOTTOM TO THE TOP: A FEW YEARS AGO I MOVED DOWN TO THE LITTLE LEAGUE LEVEL. THAT FIRST YEAR I LOST ALL MY GAMES. I FELT TERRIBLE. I TAUGHT THE PLAYERS EVERYTHING I COULD ABOUT DEFENSE AND HITTING. I REALIZED THAT AT THE LITTLE LEAGUE LEVEL MORE TIME SHOULD BE SPENT ON PITCHING. I LOOKED FOR HELP AND FOUND TOM HOUSE'S BOOK THE PITCHING EDGE. THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND THIS LAST YEAR I MADE IT TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER COMING IN LAST THAT FIRST YEAR. I'VE PLAYED BASEBALL FOR YEARS AND PITCHED, BUT THIS BOOK ALSO SHOWED ME NOT HOW BUT WHY. THIS IS WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. I UNDERSTOOD WHY AND THEN THEY UNDERSTOOD WHY THE BODY MUST MOVE IN CERTAIN WAYS. HIGHLY RECOMENDED."
positive,you got it bad: I THINK THIS CD IS THE BEST YET.. THE SONG YOU GOT IT BAD IS THE GREATEST.. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK USHER...A TRUE FAN
negative,"DIDN'T do it for me: I got this book, because I heard such great reviews on the other books. However, I am completely turned off by this book. I will look to the other crochet titles for what I am looking for as a beginner."
negative,"Is it just me....or....: Is it just me...or is there something strange about the sound of this album, as though the musicians are all slightly out of tune or it's being played on a tape recorder that's going a little bit below the usual speed? This effect is particularly noticeable on ""TOLEDO"".I loved ""Painted From Memory""- I think the songs are fantastic. These versions don't detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g ""Painted from Memory"", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don't add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with. Instead the instrumentation is dull and the arrangements unadventurous. Particularly bad is ""God Give Me Strength"", which on all other recordings is amazing."
negative,"Don't bother: The pillow is tiny and poor quality foam, my pillow I was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new."
positive,"Man, People Can Be So Stupid: Ok people, just to let all those of who think that the dvd is a couple minutes shorter than the movie, did anyone stop to think and realize that they also include the credits in the movie time? Have anyone here actually take a stop watch to the theatres and count how long it was before the credits started rolling? (If you did, you must be a sad person)If you had, you'd have relized that the credits are actually pretty long.Everyone usually leaves as soon as the first credits come onto screen and you automatically assume that its a 157 minutes. So don't give it a bad rating for it being ""supposedly shorter."" Think a little, it wouldn't hurt."
negative,"Beware! It is abridged: Though nothing in the title or description at Amazon says so, this is an abridged version. Do not waste your money: get the real thing."
positive,"Heart's Capitol debut is a smash hit!: In 1985,Heart made their Capitol Records debut with their self-titled album. The band themselves debuted in 1976 on Epic. They were dropped from Epic in 1983,following the release of PASSIONWORKS. Bass guitarist Mark Andes was a member of the disbanded Firefall,whose hits included JUST REMEMBER I LOVE YOU and YOU ARE THE WOMAN. Now for the songs:WHAT ABOUT LOVE is a hard-rocker featuring Starship's Grace Slick on background vocals. IF LOOKS COULD KILL was a minor hit. NEVER is another hard-rocker. THESE DREAMS is considered adult comtemporary. NOTHING AT ALL sounds cool. All the other songs are very good."
positive,"The Greatest Generation: Is interesting, but quite repetitive. The Greatest Generation holds your interest though. I think the book is a bit long."
negative,Disappointed Buyer: The picture of the product with Gene Hackman on the cover of the jewel case IS NOT what I received. All I got was the movie in a blank jewel case. Isn't that false advertising?
positive,"good enough diapers for me: I have no problem with these diapers on my child, however, I wish I had ordered a smaller size because he happened to transition to size 3 shortly after this purchase. Just bad timing. Otherwise, great product!"
positive,"Must read for anyone in a ""pressure cooker"" job: This is a very uplifting trip taken and proves that fancy, 'doodads' in our lives are really totally unnecessary for real to-the-bone happiness and sense of worth."
positive,"Great Product: Works great, keeps my coffee warm while I'm at my computer. Great price and great results. I would highly recommend buying this product."
negative,"Mediocre at best.: The author took 232 pages to state what could have been said in 23 pages. He uses nursery rhymes and Greek mythology to ""explain"" the publics expectation that some machines and structures fail!?! He would have been better served going into more details of the few cases he revisits repeatedly. As a working engineer, I found his explanations of how complex systems should be developed very off base. What happened to incremental design improvements, testing, instrumentation, quality control, and design reviews?"
positive,"Incredible Perspectives: This book was a suggested read by a ""non-Christian"" friend of mine that thought I should give it to everyone I was trying to disciple. Wow...what a read. Not only did this book strengthen my faith, but for a borderline unbeliever to suggest I read it was unbelieveable. C.S. Lewis knocked it out of the park! This book is perfect for every person not sure if God is real and if His name is Jesus. This will be an annual read for me, reminding me to think way outside the little box I have created about God. Awesome Book"
negative,"bad, bad, bad: As we all know by now, the author was fifteen when he wrote Eragon. Whoever he showed it to should have said, ""This is a great book, kid. You should become an author when you grow up!"" But instead they went and published it.Aside from the beautiful cover, the book has almost nothing to recommend it. There are nearly no original elements. The characters have no personality to speak of, except for the dragon, who is smug. The action is patently unbelievable from paragraph to paragraph--I remember one scene where Eragon draws his bow and fires an arrow behind him to kill an opponent who's chasing him, and I finally quit reading when he was able to beat one of the best swordsmen in the world, left-handed, after only a few months of practice since growing up as a farm boy."
negative,this type of shopping will make the more comfortable and ha: we should be very much thankful for providing this type of shopping and making the life still more pleasent then before.
negative,Sorry I bought it: The oatmeal cookies in this book are terrible...Sawdust must taste better and it will be more moist. I think she cut back on the recipe quantity so they would fit in the jar...whatever she did it turned out very wrong.
positive,"Well organized and up-to-date with HTML 4.0: Normally, I'm not a big fan of ""Sam's Net Books"". However, Mr. Darnell did a very good job with this book. Many of the available HTML books have only a few very small chapters written about HTML and the rest of the chapters are used to skim other languages that require a book in themselves. This book gives a lot of attention to HTML and when I buy a book on HTML, that's what I want! HTML is the core language of the web and this book provides a good working understanding of the latest version, 4.0. It also gives very nice, but not overdone, history lessons about HTML which further help to understand certain conventions. Additional languages are also covered in this book, as they are in most others. It's a lot of reading, but it's very well organized with a nice, clean format."
positive,Amazing Reference - A Must-Have Resource: Parnell and Null really know their stuff and this comprehensive work is something every networking admin must have on their bookshelf.
negative,"propagandist and misogynist: I took up this book with no preconceptions, just positive review from people I knew, as a book that might help me find a way to personally rediscover classic book reading in adulthood. I ended up enrolling for the first time in my life in a class on feminism. Female readers: please make sure that you have ""fallen off of Daddy's lap"" (p. 386) before you read this. Those readers who would like a less bigoted, more normal approach to reading classics in adulthood would be better advised to check out Samuel Pickering's book, A Continuing Education. This book is strictly a self-indulgent piece of propaganda for the so-called ""Culture Wars."" Sad, very sad."
negative,"Cringeworthy.: Viewed: 2/06Rate: 32/06: Coyote Ugly displayed a fair story that made my skin to crawl. A dopey looking girl who happens to dance sexily like never before and got everything going in a big city New York? That'll never happen. This film explains the reason why I have nightmares from taking, eventually dropped out of, Women's Studies in college. I don't need to be manhandled like that by a film like Coyote Ugly, telling me that women like those depicted in the film are the bomb and everything. I rather watch true films, touching realistic issues that surround females such as Hoop Dreams, My Left Foot, and The Miracle Worker, not crappy movies like Coyote Ugly. What's up with the title? Really, what's up with the concept? No, really...what's up with the actual realization of this movie being made? Maybe I should open a bar, have women wooing the male patrons, and face the music of being deported to prison for numerous of pimping violations."
negative,TOO DETAILED: this is clancy's most involved and boring book.do not buy it. instead try hunt for red october.
positive,"Highly recommended collection of poetry: Passionate, moving, thought-provoking, and exhilarating. My wife is Guatemalan and I'm from the United States. Never before have we been able to share and enjoy poetry like this-both in our native tongue. I highly recommend this collection of Marie Delgado Travis' poetry."
negative,did not purchase: why am I being asked to review a product I didn't purchase. Need to fix the system or allow me to delete the request.
negative,VERY CHEAP: I PAID WAY TO MUCH FOR THIS ITEM. I SHOULD HAVE WAITED AND HIT THE FLEA MARKETS IN FLORIDA. I COULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS CHEAPLY MADE IN ASIA ITEM FOR $3-$5 AT MOST. SO DISAPPOINTED THAT I PAID $20 PLUS SHIPPING.
negative,"Not worth 1 cent: As a fan of Wu Tang Clan for the last 11 years I find myself being more dissapointed with each solo cd released.This by far is the worst Ghostface cd and the worst solo cd from the clan. I bought it the day it came out, listened to it once and that was it.Ghost needs Rae, Rae needs Rza and Rza needs to go back to what made Wu Hot with the beats and shaolin sounds. And please if your going to make another cd Ghost please put Wu members on it. Want a 5 star cd go back to what made Iron man hot, thats the only cd of his worth buying."
positive,"Jane Austen Would Be Proud: Julia Barrett has done a wonderful job capturing the imagery set out by Jane Austen. Austen would be proud, and if she were still with us, would probably be posting her own rave on Amazon!"
positive,"John's Story: This Book was in very good condition for a used book, I was very please with it and the short time it took it to arrive. I will order again.Thanks, Carlton H."
negative,"Terribly Disappointed!!!! Curse Words!!!!: I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine. Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere. Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie. These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal. I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons. I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking. Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.Concerned in Alabama"
negative,"Not such a great idea: I was so excited to see this mat I thought that it would be great to use with the wooden airplanes and buildings. I cannot understand why this mat was not made to accomodate the buildings/planes that are made for the wooden set (,planes, hangers, firehouse etc.) The mat should be a runway without airplanes and buildings pictured so that it could actually be played with. If anything they should have drawn dotted lines for where to place buildings that you have. What are you supposed to do with the wooden buildings that you have they do not fit on the mat. The planes can actually go inside the wooden hangers(more fun than a flat mat). Though the hangers are too small to accomodate all the planes(example the kids hanger....only two fit not three) It does make a nice, expensive rug or door mat for decoration though."
negative,"COUNTRY ""AIN'T LIKE THAT"": Excuse me, but I don't think that ""Hank done it this way""!!!! This album has way too many POP tunes on it! What's wrong with COUNTRY is that people like Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes, JoDee Messina, and Faith are taking the country out of country music!!!!!! I don't think that Reba McEntire (God bless her soul) would ever have been dumb enought to release a COOKIE-CUTTER song like ""THIS KISS""!!!!!! I won't say that every song is disgusting. Hell, I actually like ""LET ME LET GO""!!!! But, people, IT'S NOT A COUNTRY SONG!!!!! WE DON'T NEED 'DVIA'S' IN COUNTRY MUSIC!!!!! PLEASE, STOP BUYING TRASH!!!! IF YOU WANT A COUNTRY ALBUM, PICK UP STEVE WARINER or 'KING' GEORGE STRAIT!!!!!!!! I think that Faith should hang up her invisible Stetson, and stop bringing her new POP-DVIA sound into Tim McGraw's music!!!!"
negative,"Hated It!: I've read all of Ms. Auel's novels, and have loved every one...until now. I kept waiting for this to get better, and I kept paging through, and it never got better. The story was boring, and insulting in it's simplicity (I felt as if I was reading an archeological textbook for 4th graders), there was no excitement as was the case in other books, and the ending was ridiculous. I actually paged through past the last paragraph, thinking that I was missing part of the book. Talk about dropping off in the middle of nowhere. The only saving grace about the ending was just that - it was the ending! DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. It's a waste of [money]."
negative,"Widescreen???: I haven't seen this movie yet because I wanted buy it and watch it. Am I the only person out there that doen't like the WIDESCREEN format? You can get the standard format on VHS and on some DVD's. If you check all the new releases, they only come in Widescreen. Why is that?"
negative,Who built this thing? And who decided to call it a docking station?: OK...so first of all does not come with its own power supply so you have to buy an extra in order to be quick and convenient. I am looking for a way to hook up my larger hp lcd monitor to it...cant do it. Only hooks up to a TV. You have to do that using your laptop. Then I want to plug in my laptop...you have to use a cord that does not easily come out of its hiding place...Totally defeats the purpose of having a docking station. This is supposed to be a quick and easy way to turn your laptop into a desktop. So really my question is what purpose does this thing serve? I paid 200 dollars for a freaking stand and lame speakers. Next time I will know better and go with Dell.
negative,Appalling: This is a grotesque despoliation of a classic film. Essential elements of the background storyline are not properly established. There are scenes whose purpose within the overall structure simply defies understanding. The nighttime 'escape attempt' sequence is shot in a bizarre green blur and was extremely unpleasant to watch. Hideous music plays frequently but the nail in the coffin of this film is the poverty of the in-game action sequences. These are generally nothing more than a confusing melange of images. The transitions from one camera shot to another seem very poorly done and it is really impossible to follow the internal dynamics of each game.
negative,"Five stars? For real?: Johnnie Taylor sounds alright on this, but the band is terrible. Out-of-tune, missing cues, and generally screwing up what should be a good CD. And you can hear Johnnie get madder and madder until, by the end, it sounds like he's glad it's over with. I have to imagine the reason this was not released back in the day the was that the band is embarrassingly bad. I feel bad for Johnnie Taylor listening to this. Five stars, y'all? Are we listening to the same CD?"
negative,"Are you kidding: Are you kidding me? Tom Savini directed this. The master of special effects gore. This movie should be rated PG except for the language. There is no gore or blood. None. I'm not kidding. The original was edgier and gorier and that was 1968! I bought it because I love zombies and the Romero trilogy and Savini but let's be honest, the acting was horrible and the gore was nonexistent."
positive,"Salty, irreverent, highly amusing: Clear the Decks!""Salty, irreverent, highly amusing"" -- New York Times""One of the best adventure tales of the war."" -- Time Magazine""A book you don't want to put down once you start reading it."" -- Our Navy""Clear The Decks... has an authentic, briny tang to it. And the climax, the tale of Admiral Gallery's brilliant capture of a German U-Boat, is breath-taking.... Anyone who wants to know the real reason why our Navy wins wars ought to read this book."" -- Herman Wouk""As an action-packed account of a baby flattop's campaign against U-boats in World War II, this is a corker. The author writes with warmth, understanding, clarity and rough humor."" -- St. Louis Post Dispatch""A good deal more than a series of belly-laughs."" -- BOMC News""You do not need to be a lover of the sea to enjoy this splendid and humorous."" -- Columbus Dispatch""A RIP-SNORTING ACCOUNT!"" -- Los Angles Mirror"
negative,jWIN jxm 14: RADIO HAS GOOD SOUND HOWEVER THE ON/OFF SLIDE SWITCH DOES NOT OPERATE SO IN ORDER TO TURN THE RADIO ON AND OFF YOU MUST REMOVE THE BATTERIES. THIS IS VERY TROBLESOME AND NOT VERY GOOD. POOR DESIGN THE SWITCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE DURABLE TYPE OF SWITCH.
negative,"Scrappy: I bought this CD after reading previous reviews, but must say that I have been very disappointed.This guitarist is nothing like any of the greats - Satrioni, Vai or Van Halen. All his music consists of is playing as fast as you can with absolutely no feel and no sense of direction. When the music does slow down it sounds like it's being made up ab-lib and is very scrappy and unoriginal. The songs on this CD also have no commercial value and are embarrassing to listen to."
positive,"music video galore!!!: An awesome collection of music videos...most of them you can't get anywhere else! The whole list can be seen in the ""Product Description""."
positive,"A perfect meditation in sound: I love this cd. I love Anagama's work period. This is my favorite and I haven't had it long. It is perfect for meditation. It has an hypnotic monotony that takes you to other levels of dreaming. A good sound to visualize with too, and also for massage... oh yes perfect for massage. Even my cats relax to it. It is like an ancient heartbeat that works to put you into balance with life ... with God. Listen to a sample first as you may not be ready for it. I remember a time when I wasn't. This sound to me is as soothing as a tibetan monastery. It can easily take you out of yourself ... or into yourself ... whatever is your wish. Happy dreaming."
negative,"Greek myth for todays reader?: I struggled with this book from the very beginning. I look at all the 5 star reviews and wonder what is wrong with me but the book was boring and never went anywhere. I found myself wading through a lot of unnecessary verbiage that only made it all go that much slower. And the story itself didn't grab me as being worth the read. Maybe I'm too impatient and want the writer to get to the point and have a little excitement, but I didn't find it as one of Lewis' better books even though it is touted as that. I'm not a great fan of Greek mythology and often struggle with Lewis' writing so the combination of these two did me in from the beginning. His writing didn't help me ""see"" what was happening, nor why. I guess I don't appreciate what the world calls ""great"" writing."
negative,was not what i ordered: it was terrible and not what i ordered at all very very angry when i got my item maybe it was my fault but wasn't happy
negative,DOESN'T WORK: THE DVD WAS A GIFT AND I AM EMBARRASED THAT IT DOES NOT WORK. IT WAS PUT IN 3 DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS AND NO GO. I WANT ANOTHER WANT SENT TO ME FREE WITH NO COST FOR POSTAGE AS WELL. I WANT IT SENT EXPRESS.
positive,"A very good book........: So,the book is ok and so but at my personal opinion i mean that the book The lord of the rings is better in its contets it has a deeper story.The hobbit is a book I would recommend to everyone who want to have a dream world on its hands and won`t fall into it.Anyway the book is good, very good but I would prefer other ones of this author because he has better books then this. Sillmarilion or The lord of the rings perhaps?"
negative,"Bias, dense and dull: Not at all even handed. Morris makes sweeping statements about what an entire group of people were thinking or feeling based on antidotal evidence at best. Anyone looking to this book to educate themselves about the history of the region should also know that the author has since recanted much of the editorializing he did in these pages. Besides being misleading, it's dense, boring and long. I recommend it only in lieu of a sleeping pill. Look for my copy on the ""used books"" shelf."
negative,"not interesting at all: i wish if i just could get my money back, the book is not interesting and boring !!!hate it"
positive,"Diana:A Strange Autobiography: This tells it like it was at that time for a Lesbian or questioning women. It was most helpful to know that others were having the same doubts, questions and experiences. I would recommend this to anyone who is wanting to learn more about the Lesbian community and how the world tends to see/treat it."
negative,"robyn luvs syd: interesting introduction to pink floyd's legendary ""missing"" founding memeber...who's most-often described in this dvd, as being ""beautiful"" yet there's not enough footage of this beautiful person, to satisfy my longing to learn more about him...but still worth seeing - if only, for the footage of robyn hitchock playing several of syd's tunes with such a heartfelt reverance that it inspired me to want to hear more from both of them!"
negative,"Don't waste your money: I purchased a set of these sheets for my in laws as a Christmas gift and also 2 sets for myself. They are junk! They should be classified as irregulars. On one set the edging is different widths, not a little different. It's off by 5 inches! A different set had 1 pillowcases stitches come out after washing and they shrunk a little bit but it was enough that my regular sized pillows don't fit in them anymore. My mother in law is not at all impressed with her set either.So save your money...don't buy these sheets"
positive,"Cozy - great price: Very deep pockets, so fits a bit loosely on a standard twin, but it's soft and cozy. I actually look forward to sleeping with these sheets! Discounted price is GREAT!"
negative,Utterly unwatchable - nonstop grating attempts at standup comedy: Incredibly inefficient information delivery. My wife and I tried desperately to watch it but just could not stomach it despite occasional useful bits. Incessant terrible affected attempts at humor and impersonations. Very old video. Pure torture.
positive,Jula Bell gives me shivers: This is an absolutely wonderful and poignant CD. Cudos to Kent. My favorite part is the final cut by underground artist Jula Bell. I was so pleased to hear her singing on something like this. Cheers to Kent for having the guts to take a chance with someone who is a truly cutting edge artist known for her integrity. I was pleasantly surprised to see her name on the CD after hearing her shiver inducing track. Why did Sting get all of that attention? Bell's song blows doors on his. It's simplicity and bold melody is the heart and soul of the soundtrack. Why wasn't this song in the movie? Buy this cd to hear one of the best female vocalists out there---
positive,"WAY COOL!!!: I picked this book up at the library as I remembered seeing stuff that was on the cover before, I live in NJ too, as this book is set in NJ. I loved this book, it ranks right up there with Green Grass Grace by Shawn McBride. I read it all in 3 hours. Great book. A great read for a rainy afternoon or a hot day at the beach."
negative,"movie: I love this movie and i received it in good shape, however the shipping was awful, I paid for expedited shipping and it still arrived late/ It took a 1 1/2 weeks to arrive."
negative,"approach with caution: i am swiss. i haven't used this product, and i don't intend to; here's why: there's no such language as ""swiss."" switzerland has four official languages (german, french, italian, and romansch), and the swiss speak dialects of these languages - swiss-german, swiss-french, swiss-italian. these dialects vary from region to region in sub-dialects; for example, zurich-deutsch varies from basel-deutsch which varies from berner-deutsch. there are even sub-sub-dialects within each region!this product doesn't even identify which general language (german? french?) it addresses. this is a sign of a poorly thought out product; i recommend looking elsewhere for a more serious study of the topic."
negative,"Don't be fooled by price & description.: This cheap HDMI cable seemed like a great deal, but don't be fooled by the low price and ""Full 1080p"" description. I tried this cable on both my Xbox 360 and PS3, the picture quality was bad on both, it skips and creates lines going up the screen when I tried to watch a movie, and it makes games and Blu-rays look very washed out and fuzzy. The cable itself is also made very cheaply and feels flimsy. While it's true some cheaper HDMI cables are just as good as the $50 ones, please don't make the same mistake I did, if you buy this cable you will not even be close to getting the full experience of what your HD devices are capable of."
negative,Simply Unbelievable: It died 14 months after purchase: I would of given it 0 stars because it died 14 months after I purchase it(right out of warranty). I would have thought that for such an expensive product that would be more durable or have a longer warranty such as Cuisinarts 3 year warranty. I know that the main reason that people buyer this rice cooker is to make rice in it. But for $150 it really should have a slow cook and steaming function. You can buy a fuzzy logic rice cooker from Panasonic with both of these features for less and Panasonic rice cookers last a long time.
positive,An OEM Battery at a Fraction of the OEM Price: I bought this battery as a replacement for a weak battery in a Blackberry 8800. It was purchased from the Amazon merchant Webtreo. Delivery was prompt and the battery looks identical to the OEM battery that came with the Blackberry. I have been using the new battery for about three weeks without any problems. This appears to be an OEM battery at a fraction of the price I would have had to pay AT&T for the same battery.
positive,disappointing end(3.5 stars): this book is full of adventure and fun.kids below 10 dont miss it.i found the end quite disappointing.as we follow the prisoners in the nautilus i thought the climax would be full of action but the book finishes as such.there are many biological facts which may hinder the adventure for young readers.i also recommend around the world in 80 days for young readers which is more thrilling than this one.
negative,"The instructions say do not chew on therefore it must not be for a baby: because my little girl loves to chew on her sippy cups. I hate I bought it but I don't recall seeing ""Not for chewing"" on the outer packaging but the instructions say this is not for being chewed on. Also liquid pours out with no suction."
positive,Perfect for second zone: Bought this as a amplifier for second zone use coming from my Sony ES receiver. Works perfect! I like the auto on feature when the Amp 100 receives a signal it turns on and when the signal is cut it turns off.
positive,"Decent: Shipped in a timely fashion. The book is an older edition so the pages were yellowed, but that is normal. There were some writing on the pages and notes stuck inside. No water damage or torn pages. Over all a good buy."
positive,A great album with amazing band music that you will enjoy!: The best songs in this CD are easily under-rated on the charts. The most elaborate songs that are very delicious to just sit back and eat up!
positive,Good enough for what it claims: The people who have written reviews primarily have gripes that they didn't pass. They must have thought the book was THE ONLY RESOURCE they would need. I used this book and I did pass the exam. It wasn't the only resource I used though.The publishers of the book even claim that using only this book will not help you pass the exam. It is an OVERVIEW text. It is a primer to help you delve into the material. This book will not substitute the large amount of qualitative reading and equation memorization that you'll need to do in order to pass.I give it a 4 mainly because the book does what it claims and because some of the more negative reviews are too far-fetched. Remember to buy the version that applies to your test year.
negative,"Difficult to find events, and some events ignored: It is difficult to find specific events in this DVD -- partly because the Main Menu is organized by Olympics Day 1, Day 2, and so on; and partly because some events simply aren't there. Kim Yu-Na, for instance, is on the screen for only a few seconds. So don't look here for her world record-setting performances (or any other figure skating performances, come to think of it). If you know what day the event you are looking for took place, that would help. But there's still no guarantee that it would be included.It seems that this DVD is meant for casual viewing. If you would like some sports rumbling on your TV, and you aren't particular about what, then this might be for you. It does include highlights of the opening and closing ceremonies, and of performances by Lindsay Vaugn, Shaun White, and Apollo Ohno. But they are just highlights, and you have to take them as you find them -- that is, IF you find them."
negative,"(two and a half stars) Boring: Catherine Wheel inexplicably added ""The"" to its name, and the original bassist (Dave Hawes) left the band. I get the feeling that ""Wishville"" was completely dominated by Rob Dickinson, who I notice put out a solo album recently, which is not a good sign that CW is still around. Anyway, CW's last album ""Wishville,"" (released five years ago!) provides no thrills. Let's face it - after ""Ferment"" and ""Chrome"" the band started on a precipitous slide, ending up on the bottom with the tepid ""Wishville.""For my money, there are four decent songs on the album (each of which are blown away by almost all of ""Ferment,"" and most of ""Chrome"") namely ""Sparks Are Gonna Fly,"" ""Gasoline,"" ""Lifeline,"" and ""Mad Dog."" All of the rest are forgettable throw-aways. Hey Rob! This isn't a good way to end! Get the band back together, and write some music comparable to the old stuff!"
negative,"I don't understand why this is a highly rated book: I didn't like the book. It doesn't have much to do with consulting. It is teaching about how to sell, how to register a company and similar pretty common stuff.The book is missing the consulting essentials - some tools, how to build and defend a workshop, some blueprint examples for different situations, approaches to strategic and ""tactical"" consulting respectively... In the same time it is handling some micro processes on a ""how to give a smile"" level and giving some advices as ""you should have a web site"". Wow. I just didn't find the value."
negative,"The Bottom Line...: If you've not read the book, then you will probably enjoy the movie with all the special effects and cute scenes.If you have read the book, like myself, you will be sorely disappointed. I loved the book and felt cheated upon exiting the theater.Let's hope they don't butcher the next book in the name of money."
positive,"Hagakure: `Hagakure' aka `The Book of the Samurai' is an old Japanese text with many anecdotes and passages formed into short paragraphs that impart the wisdom of the Samurai's way of life. Whilst this book is very much `of its time' and may seem unusual at times to western readers, it has a lot to offer if you take the time to digest it's wisdom properly and think about the ideas enclosed. Far from being about fighting and killing (although these aspects are touched upon) this is about living with a certain peace and honour. Films, like `Ghost Dog', have made this more popular than it might have been, but there is a lot more to this book that you may originally perceive and you won't regret giving it a read and contemplating the wisdom inside. Worth adding to your martial arts and philosophy bookshelf.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
positive,"Great Guitar-Pop: What a nice find. I found a used copy of this in a shop here for a few Pounds. Initially I was drawn to this CD by the cover art. I asked the clerk if I could hear a few songs and he obliged. I was immediately drawn to Round and Round, the vocal harmonies are just great. Next was Half a Heart, a super-catchy guitar-pop song. Finally Mystery Train (of Love), a great Country/Rock song. I find myself playing this CD a lot. I think I will explore some of their other albums. This is a really cool CD."
negative,"Worst of the three, but gives alittle hope for a better film: This was the worst of three movies, because of how they messed with the violence, and made the movie PG-13. What made the first two movies good was the great gore that made them feel more realistic then what was presernted here. Here there is no gore, but very little action scenes with almost no physical violence at all. This was the worst mistake that Orion made, because as a result this movie flopped with just 10 million at the box office after being shelved for two years, and took down the entire studio with it. Peter Weller should've been in this movie, because it would've been alot better movie. Some people say that this movie is better than Robocop 2, because it has less violence, and focuses more on the story which is true as it does so, but overall this movie is nothing more than a major disappointment."
negative,"Blu-Ray quality TERRIBLE. Movie: A legend: This movie is so over-sharpened it's painful to watch. I've had to tone-down sharpness on my 60"" 1080p Plasma all the way down in order to make this movie somewhat presentable. Whoever at the studio decided to run these sorts of filters for the Blu-Ray transfer should be looking for another job."
positive,"Should be 10 stars: If you are old enough to remember the Vietnam War, in which I served, this CD will haunt you. Her songs and her voice make this my favorite CD by Nanci, and I have all of them. Terrific CD at a great price."
negative,"Thank you Shoryuken.: Well, the title says it all. I almost bought this because I received a bootleg one with the complete costume. Guess I'll look somewhere else."
positive,"Good Product: Works great, looks more classy than the plain white ones for curtain hanging and it's strong enough to hold curtains. The end piece was a lot smaller than I thought. I thought it would be maybe 2.5 inches in diameter, but it's only about 1. (I didn't measure it.)"
negative,"this book sucks: I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long. There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep. avoid at all costs"
negative,"What is Warner Bros. thinking?: Is Warner Bros. really releasing classic films like ""Gaslight"", ""Grand Hotel"", ""Mrs. Miniver"", ""Mutiny On The Bounty"" and ""The Great Ziegfeld"" in COLORIZED versions. What are they thinking?! These films were released in glorious black & white, which, along with the casting, direction, story, cinematography and editing, made these films classics. I can't imagine a studio with any sense of pride stooping so low as to release their classics in anything other than their orginal versions. If this is true, all I can say is I'm glad Warner Bros. isn't in charge of the Louvre. They'd probably recast the Mona Lisa with Britney Spears sporting a big, toothy grin. Smarten up, Warner Bros. I do not plan on buying any film that has been butchered like these films will be."
positive,"truly appealing poster: Yes, it's an art print and its 4 images are excellently spaced. The elegant background image along with the overall color make this an eye-catcher."
negative,"I've been had!: This is the only thing my son wanted for Christmas. I was hesitant because I thought it was a bit pricy. But I didn't want to disappoint my son so I bought it. True, the look on his face was worth the money the toy was not. It took a really long time to put the thing together and it has to lean up against a wall to stand. When he uses any of the supposedly ""cool"" features another piece falls off. My son has a long attention span and can play with a toy for a half an hour before moving on to something else. This toy frustrates him after just a few minutes."
negative,"Very approximate drawing: It's true that there are many different motifs in the book but the drawings are very approximate, without even respecting the symmetry and the geometry of the objects."
negative,"Left Field: I didn't have huge expectations when I ordered this movie since I'd never even heard of it, but it was about the dumbest movie I've ever seen! I love the 'kid sports' movies, but the writing in this one was horrible! Should have kept this one in left field!"
negative,"RETURNING IT: We bought this as well as the Elenco electric sets thinking it would be the same.It's cheap, the parts and wires are sharp and it's not even worth the shipping.The Elenco sets are great!"
positive,"Doses, cacti and shrooms, oh my!: This book is a simply amazing in4mational text, and the forward was written by a close personal friend.If a person has questions regarding psychedelics, this is most likely the place 2 find the answers!!"
negative,"Great way to waste six hours: Warning! Spoiler!The secret that motivates reading this book is that Mary has given the world a message from God and the Catholic Church has kept it hidden. The secret: Gays are okay, abortion is okay, priests should be allowed to have sex, and women should be allowed to be priests.I seldom burn books but I burned this one."
positive,I LOVE THIS CD!: I love all of Clay Aiken's Music. I don't understand why he didn't win American Idol since he sold quicker than Ruben and I believe he made more sales too. I love his voice and it's magnificantly captivating from the first word of every song. I'm trying out for American Idol this year and hopefully I can live at least half way up to him if I get on! I love this CD. :)
negative,"Useless Strategy Guide !: This guide was a disapointment. It only gives generic information about the game. I was looking for tips on all of the car setups. Drivetrain, suspension, etc.. Nothing there. Even though the book (used) was cheap, it still was a waste of money."
negative,"Baloney: This book is NOT the true story of life among arctic wolves-- Mr. Mowat spent much, much less time with wolves than he pretends he has in this book, and simply fabricates most of his observations. It takes a special sort of person to endure the frozen wilderness to study arctic wolf behavior at length, and to accept that these beautiful animals are intelligent and amazing killing machines that don't need to fulfill people's desires to view them as non-threatening mouse-eaters. Apparently Mr. Mowat just isn't that special sort of person-- but he is a liar."
negative,What Women HATE!!!: This movie was poorly designed and not a great movie at all. I rented this movie on DVD and it's a good thing I didn't buy it before I rented it. Mel Gibson is a great actor but it's movies like this that make him look bad.
negative,"Bob: I ordered this item based on the five stars given by another purchaser. I have as yet to use it. I am basing this review on the quality of the piece.When shredding cabbage, one must realize that the cabbage will contain some moisture. There is no protective finish on this slicer to repel moisture or keep it in good order when cleaning with soap and water. Also, when I tried out the sliding box that holds the cabbage, there was an area that the box would not readily slide through. Upon further investigation I found the base of the slicer was warped, where two diagonally opposite sides were not on the same plane as the other two sides. In essence, it was a rocking horse.It seems to me that before this thing leaves the manufacturer, someone should be checking the product.Very poor workmanship and quality even though a close grained wood was used in its production.I am presently warping this thing in the opposite direction before I apply a clear epoxy paint finish."
negative,bad service: Was not informed it was going to take a month to received the order. Be careful using amazon.
positive,"Fabulous book! I recommend it to every reader!: Quite possibly John Steinbeck's best story, it follows the trail of two drifters in search for a job and living their life long dream. All is lost, however, when Lennie ""does something very bad."" Although there is a lot of profanity, you must realize that this book was created in a time of the great depression. A fabulous book! I Recommend it to every reader!"
positive,"Only ASV published: This is the only American Standard Version Bible currently being published. It is a reprint of the original Nelson and Sons of 1901. Star Publishing has done an excellent job of bringing back a forgotten translation. The below reviewer seemed dissapointed that it didn't measure up to a genuine leather Oxford Bible. I've been selling Bibles for years and this Bible is of the same quality of any other $60 Oxford Bible. Of course it doesn't compare with a $150 Bible, but you're not paying $150. For the money you won't be dissapointed and you will be able to add a new ASV to your translation list. They also offer the ASV in hardback."
negative,"Too much time spent on this story.: Very impressed with the writing and descriptive ability of young Mr. Paolini, however it took me forever to get through this story. I felt like I was as old as Brom yet happy when I finally finished. It seemed the author was trying to prove something to get this to 500 pages. He didn't need to. The same story with the same flavor could have been told on less paper."
negative,"One of the worst computer books ever: Some people may like this strange format of the book, but I really hated it. It's confusing, and not clear. It tries to be funny, but no, it's not. Too many unnecessary pictures/photos. You won't be able to use this book as a reference either. Waste of money. I only bought this book because it was the only EJB cert. book available at that time."
positive,"Kindle Sample Version: The book itself is very intriguing, written by an amazing scholar.This edition handles the umlaut better than the other versions; however, struggles with Greek letters. Could it be a Kindle issue?"
positive,"What happened to this DVD?: The date says January 1, 2010. Anyone know what happened to prevent this from coming out today, June 7, 2005, as originally planned?"
negative,"It's not as bad as I thought: I saw this film after hearing enough of bad reputation of the film. Madonna does well in musicals because she can sing and dance, but acting is not something she is good at.The story itself was not too bad. It was just that good acting was missing in the movie. I don't know why a smart hard working person like Madonna did so poorly in the film. With the interesting story they could have done better. It's too bad that it turned out like that."
negative,"Honestly, a joke!: I am not one to be pessimistic or have a bad attitude in any way, but honestly.. I have to say that the first words that come to mind are that this DVD is a joke. With that being said, the one good thing that I can say is that it is at least entertaining and made me laugh. Sadly enough... being from Austin and listening to tons of live music for years, I cannot think honestly of a time when I have seen a worse live music show. Ringo doesn't even play on most of the songs and at least his band covers up, to a degree, his deficits. I will say that it appears that Ringo himself is enjoying it, which I have to give him credit for, but that doesn't mean that others will! When I first saw this DVD, I was really looking forward to actually to see Ringo playing live, not having heard much from him in years. I could go into more critical detail, but would prefer to just think of this DVD as an amusing entertainment experience, but for serious music lovers.. save your money!"
positive,"Great Historical Storyline: The Other Boleyn Girl was a favorite of mine to read because it not only provided me with rich historical references, it was a great storyline told from the point of view of a woman who was not held in the limelight. Rather, Mary Boleyn was an unassuming girl, trying to find her way in the courts of high society, used as a pawn by her parents. It was remarkable seeing the story through the eyes of a bystander.I enjoyed the rich themes of love and loyalty, the contrast between deceit and honor. It made for a thorough read, an interesting tale. The love between the siblings is juxtaposed with their simultaneous violent rivalry. Amidst the brutality, this tale is a story about ambition. Ambition for the Boleyn family in the time of King Henry's court.Read if you love historical fiction. The story gets lengthy and somewhat repetitive towards the middle, but is still an amazing novel."
negative,"kindle 75th edition of The Hobbit: This review is for the Kindle version of the 75th Anniversary Edition of The Hobbit. Works fine on the Kindle, but audio and video that is advertised (entire reason I bought this version) does not work on the ipad Kindle app. Disappointed."
positive,"RAW AND HORRIFYING: This movie is real. I have never seen a horror movie that scared me as much as this one did. Watching the actress, you know very well that rape is the terrible act and should not happen to anyone, but it still can. Of course, some of the rape scenes were so graphic I could not watch them and I had to fast-forward, but the revenge the woman gets on her predators makes the film quite worthwhile. Excellent!"
positive,Love it: We love watching this movie at home. It never gets old and we can't wait to watch it over and over again.
negative,"I watched it so you don't have to: The green screen 270-degree sheet that surrounds most of the plane gives us some good CGI of the storm outside. The filmmakers outsourced the CGI to China, but it's a shame they also didn't outsource the script, direction, and acting as well.The film's fails on most levels, but a production begins and ends with a strong script, and this film simply didn't have it. Characters have to be likeable in order for us to care about their fate, and these 5 are very often cartoonishly obnoxious. I didn't care that their lives were in danger. In fact, I couldn't wait for them to be killed off.There are some films that are so bad, they're good. This one isn't. It's so bad, it's bad. Even clocking in at 82 minutes before the long 8 minute closing credit sequence, it feels long and ponderous in most places.Not even worth a rental."
negative,"Do not buy this Brand!!!: I was originally pleased with the make of the washer but the connector between the washer and hose broke, when i ordered the replacement parts it took them over 1 ""YEAR"" to get the replacement parts to me. That is not a typo and i find it ignorant that it took that long to replace a plastic part that they should have had mass produced with plenty of spares. Do not buy, the customer service is horrible and the machine breaks easily, not to mention to get it fixed takes a year."
negative,Book Of Lies: Mr.Camping needs to take a REAL good look to what The Bible TRULY says in Matthew 24:36.It's just a shame that alot of people lost thier money over this clown.It just goes to show you.People will believe ANYTHING and/or ANYBODY.I just heard that old man Camping is buying into the whole Mayan Dec. 21 garbage as well.Oh no.Here we go again...
negative,"piece of junk!!!!: This product has great features, slick design and really was pretty darn powerful for the first month or so that we used it. Then the suction kept getting worse and worse until finally after only FOUR months of owing this product it wont suck at all. I went in and cleaned everything out and made sure that there was no blockages etc but it still won't pick up.After struggling with this for a while my wife was talking to one of her friends who also purchased this vacuum. She also had the same problem. Their version worked for eight or nine months before it finally stoped working.It's horrible having a product stop working after you've disposed of the receipt, the box and the warranty information.I'll never buy another Hoover product again!!!!"
positive,"Touching, Beautiful, Cheap Story: Such thick deep complicated thoughts were projected through this modern masterpiece. The short title has an underlying thought on society, The Dead Bird. Ah sweet bliss this book touched my heart. Extremely disturbing to some, but they have not the depth or attention span to understand this new Faulknerian. With its joycean techniques and proustian redoolence. This book truely teaches a lesson all of us learn someday the hard way. This book fattens my shelf with its gurth of wisdom. BUY THIS BOOK."
negative,"I did not enjoy it at all: I had to read this book for class I'm taking in the fall. Because this was required reading, I expected to be blown away by the story. Unfortuantely I wasn't. I thought the messages he was trying to convey were indeed, profound, but I was not at all moved. It did not bring out any emotions in me at all while reading it."
negative,"Not a shining star: Recognizing this is a $6 ""First Guide,"" overall, it pretty much provides what one would expect: a decent dry survey of constellations, planets, and other astronomical features with some truncated star maps. And it's in a slim handy-to-pocket volume. However, two aspects make this guide subpar, even for the price. First, in a few places they did a poor job of updating the 1988 edition to this 2006 version. For instance, we are told to expect another exciting Leonid meteor shower in 1998 or 1999 (page 62). Second, they should make it clear - on the cover - this guide is geared to the northern latitudes. This little fact is buried in the third paragraph of the introduction."
positive,Great value.: This set incorporates a lot of the favorites from other sets packaged in an A to Z learning format. I have been leary of purchasing too many of these blocks for storage reasons so the zippered case is a great bonus. Definitely worth every penny.
positive,"This book will make you think: This is the first book I read by Camus and it inspired me to read more. If you like books with lots of plot and little introspection this is not for you, but it is the short plot that makes it more interesting I think. Mersault lives in an algerian town in the 1940s and this book describes his life and a crucial event in it. The point of the book was to show us how our actions and thoughts are dominated by society's expectations. In it Mersault is presented both as a conscious human being whose actions we (as him) understand but also as the monstrous figure he presents himself as to society, re: attitudes to his response to the death of his mother, the way in which he treats Marie. I was struck by this book because not only could I see myself in Mersault re his sensualism, and selfcentredness, but also by the way in which I as part of society condemn the actions of others.It is a simple book to read, but one which will make you think, so I recommend you try it."
negative,"One of the most unbelievably vapid things I've ever seen: I was trapped on a bus recently, and forced to watch this movie. An excuse to put hot, young Hollywood PG-13 girl flesh all over the screen. The fact that this movie has a high average rating is just another indicator that the pundits are right when they say the educational system is failing..."
positive,"The perfect totalitarian state.: Cynical and cold story about a 'Benefactor', who creates together with his lackeys a state of totally depersonalized citizens: conscience is a disease, cruelty is a sign of love, without liberty no crimes can be committed, sex is planned ...The precursor of George Orwell's '1984' and, more, of Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World', for the novel lacks the 'human' touch of '1984'. It remains more or less abstract, although it contains scenes worth a Bunuel.A book to recommend."
negative,"Terrible eBook edition: Just pay a couple of bucks for one that is decently formatted and has what the description states. NO Table of Contents, NO illustrations, NO navigation."
positive,"If half of this book is true....: I am a young reader in high school. I attend a Classical School, study Latin, Greek and the Great Books. If half of this book by Boettner is true, it is enough to condemn this church. The chapter on the Confessional appears more hideous than all the gods and goddesses in all the ancient civilizations. I am very interested in this subject and will be getting more books. I am planning to get a degree in classics and ancient literature. If just half of this book is true.....well, one must love slavery."
positive,Slippery Feet: Makes excellent rice. Easy to use and usefull features. It slides on counter when buttons are pushed. Feet should be more rubbery to stick better. Need two hands to operate with one hand holding onto the unit. Still a fine product that does what it's intended to do.Highly recommended. I found mine for $135.
negative,"Don't waste your money!: No plot,waste of time and money in this 'Disney Porn' flick with ugly girls and stupid story line,Stay away!!!"
negative,"Vanity Book is a Poor Read: Shari Donohue has a whimsical ice cream store in Newtown, PA where she prominently sells her eponomous book. The book itself has some interesting illustrations, but is not really worth reading. The platitudes and nonsense are filler for a personally cathartic vanity publication. Don't bother."
positive,"good artwork too!: The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs."
positive,dreams come true: this was a great movie. Donny did a great job. It was interesting to see how they created a biblical character to music and added some comedy as well.Yet it was very tastefully done.
positive,"What Women Want: Great Mel movie, but Hunt needs to find a new role. She fits on TV but movies she just can't carry off the acting.This film is light hearted and funny. There is no deep hidden message just fun."
positive,"Excellent: I am an avid dog lover. I found this book to be both exciting, and well written. Great job!"
positive,"Tell it again, George . . .: It's easy to see why Steinbeck's classic has been the subject of study for so many years; it's a master-class of literary form. Clean prose and simple storytelling, no added unnecessarys. Even the metaphor is unfussy.But Steinbeck's true gift lies in characterisation and his understanding of dialogue. When his characters speak and act they betray themselves for who they are. The reader listens and sees, gleans a past from the characters' voices and gestures. The power of the novel comes from the intimacy the reader has with these characters, and it's a testament to Steinbeck that in such a short book he reveals so much.Everyone should meet Lennie and George at least once, and if you do, you'll never forget them."
positive,"Decent 1985 Debut for this british group.: Like the last reviewer stated, the REALLY good songs on this album are ""R.S.V.P."", ""Let Me Be The One"", ""Hide and Seek"", ""Love Take Over"", ""All Fall Down"", & ""System Addict"". As for all the rest, ok, to boring. I honestly skip all the rest of the songs. Other than that, this album is a classic!"
positive,Stella!!!: This is a play that has stood the test of time. You cannot take a class about drama without this play being referenced at one time or another. A must have for any personal library. You could read this play 20 times and get something new out of it each time. The symbolism and thought that went into this play is amazing.
positive,"By a true scientist!: An exciting science fiction novel that pushes the limits of scientific imagination. Mr. Reynolds has a Phd in Astronomy and worked for The European Space Agency for 13 years. Now, he is a full time science fiction writer. This novel explores behavior of humans when presented with arduous undertakings and reveals our darkest fears and how we try to cope with them in our unique way. In a science fiction frame, Reynolds tries to state that what is wired in us is not pure evil or pure goodness but a mix of them both. How much of each component you have in you will determine your course of actions and makes who you are. Because I'm a total geek, I loved it. Give it try and you might love it too. @shakirbahzad"
negative,"Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!: Dont bother with this crap! It is one of the worst if not the worst! Movies that I have ever seen! It has bad acting,story and it is so so boring! I dont understand the point of this movie! TERRIBLE! DONT BOTHER!"
positive,"a MUST HAVE for the crib!: My baby didn't get into this toy until he was about 8 mos. old or so.. but when he did, he LOVED it. At night, he can turn it on by himself and the light really comforts him. He is now able to play with the little levers, too."
positive,"The System: This is a wonderful book ever I read and worked for me like explained. I never got laid before reading this book, now I feel myself like a champion :-) I go to the bar, go to the beach, go to shopping mall, I get the girls everywhere. Thanks to the writer and Amazon for keeping such kind of books."
negative,"Rating on Chess Only: The chess game has 3 levels of play including a ""random"" selection on which level the game plays at. Thing is I haven't noticed a bit of difference in the level of play and the programming is really bad. The game will make the same moves over and over. Another thing, if I can beat any chess game at ""Expert"" the game is really really bad. Too bad the CD itself wasn't good for something."
positive,ONE OF THE BEST: I use this book almost every lesson for my Algebra classes.One of the best for extra practice.
positive,"TEEL'S A REAL HALFA: whata halfa!.... i mean the kid is a real talented flamer!....the way he jukes and jammies and flaunts the goods... woof, him and the rest of the dozen really got me thinking.. has the whole world gone halfa....hearn's struggling brain mass"
positive,loved it: this was a great value and great product..just what u would expect from Kent Marine... best value for the size
positive,"Wow: I really never knew that a 19 year old could be so creative, i am only 15 and that was the most amazing book i have ver read, it even beats lord of the rings!!!"
positive,Great for a trip: I bought this movie to my 6 years old daughter see when we are on a trip. But she like so much that everywhere we go she take with her. It's a great movie.
negative,"I'm sorry...but this one wasn't all of that for me!: I usually don't give bad reviews but I must make an exception. I purchased the book sometime last year, and have struggled to finish it after pickin it up and putting it down a couple of times.After seeing all of the ""glorious"" reviews I decided to give it another try and FINISH IT! I must say that I was truly disappointed. I am sure Ms. Spencer's next book will be ""da bomb"" but this was a dud for me.It was tooooooooooooo slow - and it was sooooooooooo predictable. I mean I figured out the book's ending in the first portion of the book but it took Ms. Spencer 200 pages to finally get to the end of the story.I'm sorry...I just was expecting a lot MORE based on all of the reviews that I read. But then again...who am I to judge!Try it you might like it!"
negative,"Vastly Overated: When I began to read this book, I was expecting a superbly written historical account of the Saturday Night Live television show, and instead got nothing more than a plethora of transcribed interviews with people associated with the show.When I began reading this book, I was hoping the authors would include a listing of all of the people who have graced the show as regular performers, or one of all of the guest hosts, but none such information was offered.Apparently all it takes to write a best-selling book nowadays is a tape recorder, and a word processor, because that is all this book is comprised of.A court stenographer could have written it."
negative,"A reason to revive the Inquistion.: Where to start criticizing this movie? It fails so miserably on so many levels that it's difficult to know where to begin.It's obvious from watching this movie that the people who made it either didn't read the historical facts concerning Joan or did read them and simply chose to ignore them.Furthermore, you would never know Joan of Arc was a devout Catholic from seeing this movie. Aside from a few one sentence requests to see a priest, Joan's deep faith and spirituality are totally left out. Not that Milla Jovovich has that kind of range as an actress anyway but couldn't they have at least tried?Other than that I don't know what to say about a movie that seems to go out of its way to demonize a young girl who, by all contemporary accounts, was literally a living saint.It's just a terrible movie. Please don't waste your money."
positive,"HD-DVD is Outstanding: A genuinely worthwhile video and audio improvement over the standard definition disc. The image is better than what I experienced in a movie theater. One of the great Saturday Afternoon popcorn films in the same league with ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" and ""Indiana Jones."" Image and audio are superb."
negative,"Cone Boobs: I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it, but this bra is just not as good. The quality is not great; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff. When I tried it on, the bra separated my boobs very far apart. It made me look like a 1950's housewife with cone boobs. No cleavage, total separation, very pointy. Just not attractive.As for the sizing, I didn't feel that the cups were too small. I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional. The cups just made my chest look unattractive."
negative,"It isn't a toy...: This is a decorative item that, although it's advertized as ""crystal,"" looks a great deal more like pressed glass. It does, however, come with ""lead content warnings"" so one must assume that it is, indeed, lead crystal. But don't expect sparkle -- the item is neither cut nor polished.It's small and pretty, and comes in a cheap plastic presentation case lined with flocked paper and Disney advertising. Still, what else are you going to give to a woman cast in the role?"
negative,"Good but disappointed: I have seen four 3D movies on my new 3D TV and this one has been the least exciting as far as its 3D effects. I was disappointed. I am amending this review after watching the movie again. While I did enjoy the 3D version, I felt the 3D effects were subpar. It is still enjoyable to watch and still has the 3D perspective. They don't send things protruding out at you like other 3D movies do. It doesn't have the WOW-factor that other 3D movies have had."
negative,"END OF THIS LINE: In 1988, British gay novelist Alan Hollinghurst made a striking debut with ""The Swimming Pool Library."" Set in the Darwinian landscape of pre-AIDS homo London, the writing was beautiful and urgent, flaring at times to real poetry, while the characters exerted the pull of infatuation. I reached the end of that book resenting the forced separation and wanting to hang out with the whole lot for a lot longer.Since then, each subsequent Hollinghurst novel has been more disappointing than the last. In the latest, ""The Line of Beauty,"" his literary go-cart has come nearly to a halt. The writing is still elegant, studded with memorable turns, but the story is utterly without consequence, ditto the characters. Is Hollinghurst writing or doing his nails? Verdict: don't bother."
positive,Good: Teaches you really good and easy to understand and allows you to learn the asvab with no problem in order to pass with flying colors
negative,Not What it seems: I will never again buy an Eric Flint book without physically examining it. The two official reviews above make it look like a sequel; it is not.
negative,"Never got here.: I can't review this item because it never made it to me. I received an email a few days later saying the money would be credited back to me (which it was). However, I have never had a problem with receiving shipments at my address. The seller claimed that my address was not found. I received something from a different seller just 2 days before though. I am not sure what address they tried to send it to, but it was not the one I gave. Unfortunately I had to find this book somewhere else. The book is a great find, however, and I am very pleased with it."
negative,Sent wrong book: I ordered Introduction to Social Problems (6th Edition)and they sent me Introduction to Sociology (5th edition). The books don't even have the same authors. When I tried to amend the problem they never responded to me.
positive,"Love This Item: I have four squeem shapewear items and i love them all. I do suggest finding your correct size, not the size you think you are. The terry cloth lining absorbs all wetness and i do see a difference in my shape. It flattens your middle so your blouses, tshirts and dresses look much nicer."
positive,"Lschs student review for five points extra credit: by Rcase: The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a book that had some things I liked and some things I didn't like. The things I like in the story outweighed the things that I did not like. For example, I liked the intense Bible discussions between the fundamentalist; Les, Luther, Jimmy, etc; and Michael, the lone catholic. Another thing I like was the fact that I learned so many new things about Catholics while I was reading the story. Some things I didn't like were the lack of reaction from the fundamentalist during the Bible discussions. Also, I didn't like how they ended the last chapter of the book; I don't think a pastor of a church would just kick someone out of their church for making a good point about something. The author makes that up in my mind when he writes the epilogue. In the end I think this was an above average book, t would give it four out of five stars."
negative,"Hugely disappointing!: One star is half a star too many. We waited over ten years for this book and paid full price for the hardcover as soon as it came out. What is up with that looong boring song being printed over and over in it? The book could have been half as long without that. And as far as the story, the previous books hint that Ayla's child is going to be a boy and that there will be some sort of confrontation between her two sons. No chance of that happening judging by the ending..."
negative,"Disappointing transfer, especially coming from Criterion: I have quite a library of Criterion DVDs and have come to expect quality transfers from this company. There have been a couple of duds, including the very bad transfer of The Scarlet Empress. But The Drum, one of the films in this set, is incredibly bad. It has terrible definition and colors that look like that have gone through a washing machine. Film is almost unwatchable. It looks like a third rate, public domain DVD that you can find at bargain basement prices."
positive,"Excellent, except for the slow songs: As the title says, this album is excellent, except for the slow songs. ""Ape Dos Mil"" relies on an obvious rhyme with cursing and is off-putting. ""Must've Run All Day"" has an awkward Daryl singing ""come 'ere"" creepily. Rest of the album is tremendous, especially side B (Stuck Pig onward). The first three songs are rad, too."
positive,"Great family game: My husband,boys and I have enjoyed playing Disney Scene It. My boys, of course, know more about the movies than their parents, but we still have a lot of fun playing."
negative,"Do I need to be a Christian to be successful?: Zig Ziglar strongly insinuates that we need to accept Jesus as our savior to be truly happy and successful. I think he should change the title of this book to ""Christianity for Dummies."" I have no interest in his religious preachings but I got one from this book in a very annoying undertone."
negative,So HOT it caught on FIRE!!!: Purchased this item and it caught on fire during its first use. I had it plugged in for about 3 minutes when my sons bottle and product caught on fire. I do not recommend this item. When I called the company they requested that I spend my own money to return the item and if they found that it was a mechanical failure they would replace the item only after I paid shipping. When I asked about my bottle they said their was nothing they could do about my loss. (Fire had caused the bottle lid to fuse to the bottom)This product is not worth a penny.
positive,"Handy and accurate: I find this book most useful for the 12 star maps found at the very begining. It gives basic information about astronomy in a comprehensible manner. The book is handy enough to keep with you and with a small penlight you can reference the maps while observing the night sky, easily fits in a jacket or pans back pocket. Additionally I found the mythology behind the traditional western culture naming of the constellations interesting.Only criticisms include 1) as previously mentioned, no star charts for the Southern Hemisphere and 2) wasted pages printing illustrations of the characters the constellations represent. These pages could have been used to add Southern Hemisphere maps or to discuss more then the listed 13 constellations."
positive,"Much more than a gimick...: It looks like a gimick: Turre invites some of his trombone-blowing friends to blow insteda into shells. The compositions range from cuban to indian(!) to bop, so you may think he's just showing off the strange sound of the shells. But no -- there's real essence behind this craziness. Turre has a real vision, a concept of sound, and it just ends up organic and real. What happens is you forget that this is a ""weird"" ensemble (e.g., 3 shells, bass, percussion and a solo trombone) and you just hear strong, commited music."
positive,"Rusty to Firepaw to...not telling XD: Rusty wanders into the forest and meets some strange cats. When he wanders in he meets Graypaw, Ravenpaw, Dustpaw, and Sandpaw. Bluestar gives him the apprentice name: Firepaw. Finally at the end Firepaw and Graypaw get their warrior names. What will they be?"
negative,Buy The Gamecube Version: this game is ok but the gamecube version is a lot better. If you're a serious spiderman freak then buy this game for gamecube or xbox.
negative,Not for me: I loved the feel of this lub but it left me itchy and sore after using it twice. I have used other silicone products but have never hurt afterward. Must be something new in this one.
negative,"nelly is so hood...............................syke: i gotta admit, i liked nelly back in '99 wit country grammarbut he went commercialgrillz iz da wackest beat i eva heardbut niggaz love itand paul wall needs 2 get his pussy poppedcuz he makin it even harder 4 white boyz 2 make it bigthanks 2 him itz gonna be harder cuz when i send my demo 2 somebody dey gon be all like ""he prolly like paul wall"" comparin me 2 dat bitchwell daz my review~1~"
negative,"12v battery charger: This product was less than acceptable! I used it to charge my battery, and it burnt out before the battery could even charge all the way! Rip off!"
positive,What is real? What is true? What is Good? In Public Schools?: A must read for those into philosophy and wishing to apply it to the public school system in america. The insight of the authors is amazing.
negative,"A mnemonic device, nothing more: This book is little more than a list of perl methods to help jog your memory. If you're fluent in perl but sometimes need to remember the name of a method, this book can help you. But you'd better be able to remember the proper syntax on your own, since the book doesn't include it (granted, perl is fluid enough to make that an easy guess too). If you want a language reference, this book isn't it. It's like carrying a set of flash cards. If you don't know it to begin with, this book won't help you learn it. Even as a reference I found it lacking."
negative,"Peanuts?: My child has a severe peanut allergy, and I want to know if it is safe to feed Uranium Ore to him. They really should put a label on this stating one way or another. I called the manufacturer, but they acted like I was crazy for even asking. They must not have kids, otherwise they would understand. I mean, even if this Uranium Ore was processed on equipment used to process peanuts, it could be dangerous for my boy. He's very allergic."
negative,"Emer Galileo: I purchased our Emer from Sears almost two years ago, and it broke within a month. We sent it back to New Jersey, and it took two months to have it returned. Within a month it was broken. Now it is a pile of plastic and I don't know what to do with it. Very disappointed in product and service."
positive,"Saved Me During the First Week: No matter what anyone says, breastfeeding is not always easy. There were times during the first couple weeks of breastfeeding that I thought that I would give up. This book saved me!! I only read the parts that I needed, and I felt encouraged. I would recommend this for any mother planning to nurse!!"
positive,"Great Blu Ray Presentation: Didn't see the BD review on Blu-ray.com so thought I write a quick one. Just watched the BD version this week and actually very happy and impressed by the transfer and DTS audio. Would give the video a 4.5 stars out of 5, and audio 5 out of 5. The overall movie is just gorgeous on BD, and if you a big fan of the movie, I'd say it's money well spent for the double dip.Perhaps just a slight downside and that is the BD clarity and details do make Diane Lane look a tad older than she needs to be.But, still a great release and worthy purchase."
positive,Helpers when playing cards: We play a card game that requires holding several cards. These card holders are a huge help. I really like having multiple colors.
positive,"Loooove it!: Had the cassette when I was 16, missed having it and had the chance to purchase it again. Fast shipping, great condition, just love it!"
positive,Great book: Its a very unknown work of Maslow. I recommend reading it more than once. Gives his last works in his later years.
positive,"Hot Spell: This was a good read. I must admit that I bought it for the story by Lora Leigh...I'm very fond of her ""breeds"". The other stories were entertaining as well.J.Davis ""loves to read"""
negative,"Is Musiq losing his touch?: This by far was the worst of the three albums from Musiq. It definetly does not live up to the traditional Musiq style that I am used to. The lyrics are ok, but the beats are not as tight as the first album which was by far the best. Or even the second album which was not as good as the first but it was ok. It seems like with each album Musiq's rhythms start to wander off. Musiq is known for his beats, rhythms, sounds and mezmorizing words in his songs. Did he get new producers or something? If so he needs to go back to the original ones because this album is the worst by far. Musiq I know you can do much better!"
negative,"ALL OTHER REVIEWS ARE FOR THE WRONG FILM!!!: Note that all of the reviews posted here are for a completely different movie ""Descent"", NOT the horror movie ""The Descent"". Please check what movie you are posting for before you post a review!"
positive,"Entertaining and informative: Venus is a sista that has it going on in every way. She has a good job, live in boyfriend and long pretty hair. Out the blue one day, Venus goes to the beauty salon and instructs her stylist to cut her hair off then she sends her boyfriend on his way. Wonder what cause this? Venus is in search of her independence. This is an outstanding debut. God's Blessing's to the author."
positive,Great Christmas story!: I love reading this at Christmas time to help me remember the true meaning of Christmas! Such an inspiring story.
negative,Moron: How can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performs?This guy is just a moronic retard.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM.
negative,"I gave up after 57 minutes: Because nothing even remotely interesting happened so I decided to read a book instead (""Swimming Home"" by Deborah Levy).I'm glad I did not pay to go see this, I would have fallen asleep."
positive,"Love the shoe rack!: My daughter has a lot of shoes. She used to just either leave them on the floor or would toss them in a empty laundry basket.The rack was easy to put together and so far have had no problems. It holds all of her shoes and takes up little space.The only drawback I saw was that you see the bottoms of the shoes and you wouldn't want to put heavier shoes all on one side.We are very pleased and if the needs again arises, I will buy another one. I am glad I bought it."
positive,"Mel Gibson at his best!: The subject matter of this film will generally be hated by men and loved by women. (Just read the reviews if you don't believe me) Subject matter aside, the acting was superb! I imagine Mel Gibson had a great time doing this film. He expressed just about every imaginable emotion all in two hours. It takes a great actor to combine comedy and seriousness successfully, which I believe he did. This movie may not be a ""classic"", but if you just want a few laughs, I definately recommend it."
positive,"Great for the price: I only play tennis occasionally with my 5 year old. This saves my back and nicely picks up and stores the balls. Great for the price. I did read the other reviews and install the legs inside the basket, and also scraped off the red sticker immediately. I use some velcro tape to hold the handles together when carrying, but the ball compartment has stayed closed for me, and it stands as well as any other ball hopper of it's type."
positive,"All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others: ANIMAL FARM(1954) an animated film of the book by George Orwell directed by John Halas and Joy Batchelor. All voices by Maurice Denham. A good film. Interesting to see a fully animated film made in the 50s NOT by Walt Disney. In spite of being funded by the CIA, the film is surprisingly devoid of communism. Napoleon the pig(Stalin) could easily be Mussolini, Obama or any other tinpot dictator. The film scrubs up Snowball(Trotsky) something fierce and actually has a relatively happy ending. That said, the book is depressing and the movie is still quite brutal especially for the time period. Definately worth a look. Just do not go in expecting singing mice and dancing fairies."
negative,Not in the same league: This movie just plain ... If you are a fan of the first two you will be sorely disappointed by this installment. It looses its sci/fi roots and edgy humor and just becomes cheesy.
negative,"Doesn't fit: I have two SKS rifles one chinese and one yugo and the pad does not fit either. The mounting holes line up just fine; but, the overall size is too small."
negative,"Defective Product, avoid at all cost. Save your frustration!: First, I will admit that this product packs a lot of features.But, it comes with a big price tag to make up for the features.The major problem that I have is that it locks up on certain mp3 songs and the only way to reset the player is to remove the battery. This is unacceptable!Lastly, tech support is non existent. I tried contacting samsung and they never reply to my emails. They're not very organized as there are many support channels and you have to get in touch with the right ones. If they can't fix my problem, I'm definitely returning it for a refund!... I was surprise to read some people are experiencing the same problems. My co-worker has a previous yepp version and he told me that it was a known problem. Sounds like Samsung hasn't fixed it. Samsung = poor quality."
negative,"Disgusting on multiple levels: If this book had been the movie I saw, I would have walked out of the theatre. It made me sick to my stomach hearing the condition of her kitchen, her political rants and her seemingly heartless discription of the people who lost loved ones after 911."
negative,It was just ok....: This video was just ok. I give it a D+ maybe a C-. Shaq's comedy series have been really good but this was not as good as the others.
negative,HELP: This book is so boring there is no action no feeling it is about boring everyday people in a boring everyday town doing the same thing Ya da ya daya da! I fall asleep everytime i read it! oh bye the way are there cliff notes for this book?
negative,Stop the music...: this is one bad movie. It's simply horrible. Even the dancing can't be saved. Oh wee a terrible movie. Girls just wanna good movie and this one isn't it.
negative,"the ""black sheep"" of the catalog...: if you asked Queen fans in the States the reason for the band's decline in popularity here, alot of 'em will cite Hot Space as the reason...the band did lose more than a few long-time fans with this one, and in fact the tour for the album would ultimately be Queen's last in the USA. Many of the tracks aren't bad per se, but often they're experimental to a fault...and in many instances, the ""human"" element is upstaged by synths & beats. With the exception of a handful of tunes, Hot Space is a far cry from the days when Queen proudly boasted ""No Synthesizers!"" on their albums. I might recommend this for completists, but first-timers should probably avoid this for now. However, if you want to hear proper versions of these songs, check out Queen's Live At The Bowl CD or DVD...""Staying Power"", ""Action This Day"" and ""Back Chat"" are actually powerful in raw form, unlike the techno vibe in the studio."
negative,"poor remake: Whoever made this misunderstood the word `scary', special effects make you go ""wow"" not ""aarrgghh! ""Look to the original version."
negative,"Waste of Money!!: I thought that this toy was cute but that is it. I think that this was the stupidest toy ever, It did nothing. My baby didn't even look at it. It is so heavy that if it were to fall of the crib while it was attached, the baby would be serioulsy injured. I would not reccomend this toy to anyone."
negative,"An embarrassment: I am a big Queen fan, and this cd is their worst ever. Why they put it out instead of taking a sabbatical is beyond me...The only decent songs are Under Presuure - even if the live versions tend to put the studio one to shame, and Put Out The Fire. Maybe Life Is Real could be saved from the bonfire as well. The partially Spanish-sung Las Palabras de Amor is pretty silly. I am Spanish but have always found appalling the knack of foreign artists to try and record in my language because the lyrics lose a lot and sound silly.All in all, do not buy this if you consider yourself a Queen fan, unless you're the blind-faith kind, which is notrecommendable. You'll find yourself cringing more often than not if you listen to it..."
negative,"Poor Quality: Be careful when you order used books - this one had no glue on the spine, when you tried to read it the pages just fell out, and we discovered some of the pages were gone. It's not a bargain when you have to pay postage for something that doesn't work!"
positive,Treasure Island: Ifound the book Tresure Island an exciting book like when Jim and his crew faught the pirates. Some parts of the story were boring like when theytalked about mad dog's adventure and the treasure map.Overall for the most part I enjoyed this book becauswe of the adventure I have read many books like this and find them average. I learned many things reading this book about Jim and the pirates I found this book adventurous and for the most part exciting
negative,"Material on this CD is below par!: I was very disappointed in this first CD from Clay. There is still nothing wrong with his voice, which I admired from the beginning of his appearance on American Idol. But the songs on this effort are rather ordinary, if not downright boring. I would have enjoyed more covers of older or modern standards, such as the effort he made on ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"". He deserves better management!! His voice talent deserves a far better team behind it. I hope future outings have material up to his capabilities."
positive,"Synopsis: Dr. Ivie is in Italy looking for a beetle. Unfortunately, the beetle he seeks was only found one time by one person thirty years ago in one hole in the ground, and it's only about a millimeter long. While the graduate students dig and all sift through mud, dream sequences, animation, and stock footage open a window into the obsession and passion that drives these impossible tasks of science. The ""science"" of clear and instant results is dissolved to reveal the reality where methods are bizarre and failure is not only common, but just another step in the process."
negative,"This printer is a nightmare!: It is almost impossible to get this printer to print without an out of paper error, jam, etc. Doesn't matter what kind of paper you use. Whether you put in one piece (still doesn't work), more then one ( takes entire stack) It always says out of paper when it's not. What a nightmare. I'm finally tossing this item. I will NEVER by an HP product again. There are hundreds of complaints about this problem and they won't take the printer back."
positive,It all begins here...: Right from the first chapter you're hooked. Great characters and excellent story. Should have read this long ago... Can't wait to continue with the LOTR trilogy...
positive,"Not as good as it once was: I've been a longtime subscriber to Men's Fitness. As one of the other reviewers said, this magazine used to be better. It still has a great deal of workout, diet and fitness information, but it's not as good as it once was. I think the magazine is losing its focus a bit as each issue does seem to have more and more about sex, pornography, etc.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because a lot of the workout and fitness information is still very useful (otherwise I would give it fewer), but I used to feel this magazine was worthy of 5 stars."
negative,"Not for true beginners: I bought this book after reading the reviews. The impression I had was that this would be an excellent introduction to Java. What I discovered is that this book ASSUMES KNOWLEDGE OF C++. If you dont have some background in C++, then skip this and go for something else!"
negative,"Great idea, poor design: This shape-wear is the best I've had until now regarding easiness to wear and put-on. It does a great job at keeping the post-pregnancy flabby belly under control. However, after about 2 months of daily use, the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric. It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out. I wish there was a better designed support for this binder. Otherwise, it is awesome - good looking for such lingerie. So, if you buy it, expect 2 months of wearing it without problems..."
positive,"Earth-Shattering: When I first started reading this book, I realized it was just another quirky scifi book, that would end up with somebody killing somebody, and that would be the end. But as I neared the end of the book, something struck me. This COULD be OUR future...if we didn't DO something. This book completely changed my opinion about the contrast between literature and entertainment, censorship, and society in general."
negative,"The most boring ""work of literature"" i have ever read: This book is terrible!!! I was forced to read this book for summer reading and definitley did not enjoy it, dont waste the 14 bucks to buy this piece of junk. I really hated this it is boring!!! Wallace puts too much useless info into the 576 pages of this hunk of crap. The first sentance is about two pages long and he often switches between 3rd and 2nd person, it is really annoying. Dont wate your life reading this book try reading ""My name is asher LEv"" by Chaim Potok It is truly an inspiring novel unlike this boring book. Wow i hate this book i truly hate it with every square inch of my body! I promise dont waste ur time reading this book"
positive,"Well worth $1: I needed a copy of ""Leaves of Grass"" that includes the 1855 prose preface. The formatting of this Kindle book is perfect. I know I could read it on my computer for free on some websites, but I wanted a version for my Kindle. This Kindle edition will not disappoint you! I gladly paid $1 for a more ""portable"" option. I prefer reading on Kindle than the computer screen."
negative,not what i paid for: the movie that i recieved was stated to be very new or close to new when i recieved it there were more scrats on it then i have seen on most very used dvd's. i was very disappointed with it it if wouldnt for the fact my sons birthday was the day before i recieved it i would have returned it due to the marks on it!
positive,"Who'd a knowed?: Back in the days of ""Fresh Prince"" Will Smith was a blast of fresh air in the genre, but in this movie he shows that he is a major talent. This combined with the great FX on the Blu-ray makes this an enjoyable movie."
negative,"It doesn't even get warm to the touch, much less heat a bottle!: We got this for on the go use and it doesn't even warm up to the touch. It's a heating pad you wrap around the bottle and how is it supposed to heat a bottle if your hands are warmer than the wrap? It took over 45 minutes to take a cold bottle to even room temp (we used Playtex Ventaires) and by then you might as well have just left it sit at room temp. Useless product. We now take a thermos of heated water and a jar and heat our bottles in the the jar. Cheaper, faster and even more portable. I wish I'd still had the receipt for this thing, I couldn't figure out any use for it so we tossed it. What a waste of money and landfill space :("
negative,"Last Hero in China - 5 stars / Deadly China Hero - no stars!: Deadly China Hero is a poorly edited version of the original Last Hero in China. I'm glad so many people like it but it lacks about 15 minutes of the original movie and they are the minutes that make it a cohesive movie instead of a jumble of martial arts fights. This taking of a classic martial arts movie, chopping it up, and then releasing it under a different name has got to stop! People deserve the chance to see the original movies!"
negative,"Beware - Product is not as pictured: While the text of the item's description is for 0.5ml of Loctite 222MS threadlocker, what is pictured is, as far as I can tell, a 50ml bottle (based on a later google image search). I purchased because I wanted that bottle that was pictured that would stand upright and not leak all over. Instead, I got a tiny tube with significantly less threadlocker than was anticipated. Toolfetch doesn't charge much for the tube, but quite a bit (almost 3x) for shipping, so you won't return it if, like me, you weren't paying close enough attention and relied on their picture to be an accurate representation of what they were shipping. Based on the fact you can't blow the picture up enough to read the printing on the bottle to confirm its volume, the marked-up then marked-down pricing and the disproportionate shipping charge, I can only conclude that this was intentional on the part of toolfetch."
negative,Not: Did not work on my 2006 colorado Crew cab. just the bumps on the highway and the truck woud bottom out.
negative,Poor Connection: Charger connection to bluetooth is poor. It does not connect well and sometimes looses connection which causes poor charge performance.
positive,"I can't stop playing this CD.: You can't like electric guitar and not love this CD. It's smooth, jazzy, and bluesy all at the same time. If you liked the music in the film ""Bull Durham"" you'll be in heaven."
positive,Good book: This is a great book. I would recommend it to anybody that is interested in learning about Native American philosophy.
positive,"One of my favorites: It's been almost four decades since I read this book, but still whenever some particulary heinous episode of human idiocy appears in the news, my mind throws out a mental footnote quoting the teenaged hero's passionate defense of humanity before an interstellar tribunal deciding whether to wipe away Earth. Depsite the hokey title and its ""juvenile"" status, it has lots to offer."
negative,"Did not heat up enough: I purchased this item for my husband, who likes very hot coffee and tea, but it does not keep beverages warm as advertised. We tried it a few times and even when his mug went straight from the coffee pot to the warmer, it didn't keep it warm. Too bad, so sad. I returned it."
positive,Gilette Fusion Razor Blades: I really like the Gilette Fusion razor blades. The only thing I don't like is the price. Razor blades have gotten really expensive. None of the ones I've tried have lasted as long as the Fusion blades. But even they should last longer for my pocketbook.
positive,"A Must Buy!: Leroy Eims has hit the nail on the head with this book! My copy of it is about 10 or 11 years old and I still use it! Without a doubt, Eims has mastered one-on-one discipleship in this book. He shares with us the importance of disciple-making and how to do it correctly and systematically. He tells us what to look for in a potential disciple and the four progressive steps in the life of a Bible student: a convert, a disciple, a worker, and a leader. If you want to know the nuts and bolts of personal discipleship, this book is for you! Does anyone have his email or snail mail address? If so, please email it to me! Thanks."
positive,this movie really makes you think: This movie was really well done and makes you realize what is going on today
positive,"Wow!: I bought both volumes of these sonatas after hearing only the first track and have not for a moment regretted the decision to do so. In college, I had the opportunity to play and become intimately acquainted with these sonatas. Being partial to 'period' performance, I have always been on the lookout for a good 'historically informed' recording and Breitman and Rivest don't fail to deliver. These are sonatas for fortepiano and violin, not violin sonatas and Breitman and Rivest's approach always keeps that cardinal rule of these pieces in mind. The transparent timbre of the gut-strung violin and fortepiano lend a clarity to these sonatas not often found in a lot of other recordings. The impeccable technique of both artists with the judicious use of vibrato by Rivest adds to that clarity. A wonderful opportunity for those who think they don't like period performances to become aquainted with the practice."
negative,"Impossible to read and over priced!: As a senior executive and MBA student in a top 10 program I found this book to be one of, if not the worse textbook I have ever had to work with. It is nearly impossible to read, it lacks crucial information and explanation of the topic. The exercises are endlessly longwinded, and are not helpful in understanding the material. The presentation, i.e., font and layout are objectionable and make it all the less desirable. This is an expensive book that offered no value whatsoever to my work at learning this material. Others in my program expressed similar views of the book. (If possible I'd give it no stars.)"
positive,"Awesome: Geno is a great Louisiana artist. If you ever get a chance to hear him in person, jump on it."
positive,"2-quart Saucepan: I had a 2 1/2 quart saucepan from Farberware. But, the knob came off the lid. Could not find a replacement lid so we purchased the 2 quart saucepan. We have many Farberware pots and we love this product. We have used Farberware pots and pans for at least 30 years and never have been disappointed."
positive,"In general, a good book: I took the Toefl test this morning and I have to say that this book was very useful. I haven't received the official grades yet but my note should be between 215 and 265, and given the fact that I've just studied two hours a day for one month...Definitely this book helped me a lot to improve my grammar, but I also believe that the examples were organized in a boring fashion. The practice tests for the listening section are really good, about the reading section... my advice to you: READ! READ! READ! No matter how much time you spend on vocabulary, they will find a word you don't know."
negative,"Made Me Feel Worse!: A friend suggested this herb to me to help with my awful PMS. After taking Vitex for only three days during PMS, I began to feel horrible: very irritable, nauseous and foggy. After doing some research, I found that a percentage of women react very negatively to this herb -- some people remarked that they initially felt better, but then progressively felt worse and thought they were going crazy; some said they immediately felt terrible. I guess it's a gamble that many of us are willing to take to feel better though. Wish it had worked!"
positive,"GREAT!!! Right to the last word of the last paragraph.Thanks: Your characters are alive and well.You had to have been there to write about them,Of course you weren""t but they ALIVE.I will read the rest of your novels.Thanks"
positive,"Paper Feed Problems?: A lot of people have had problems with paper feeding on these all in ones. About 2% - 3% of these babies built between summer 05 and winter 06 had bad rollers. I called the help line and got all this info from the rep after some troubleshooting (paper settings, cleaning, etc). The ""cleaning kit"" they sent is actually an abrasive pad type thing that you put in the printer, and run some software to 'resurface' the rollers. ""Cleaning"" is misleading; we've all cleaned the rollers, whether or not it works. It actually seems to grind off some of the rubber, and my printer's working like a charm now. Just a tip. Get the 'cleaning' kit."
negative,"Use your money on something else!: My 2 and 1/2 year old loves Bob, so he played with this for a little while. Tired of it quickly, as the magnets are not strong enough to hold blocks together to have any real pretend play. Seriously, every time he tries to open the door for Bob, the whole house falls down. The blocks are so light weight that his wooden block set is more fun to build a house with. Buy the Bob the Builder lego set and stay away from this set!"
positive,"This Film is ""Special"": Possibly the best Superhero film I've seen in forever. It has a great message. A awesome end that makes you feel great. I've liked Rapaport since ""the war at home"" anyway & this is his greatest role. It's not a spoiler to say that at the end you still say ""Wait...did he have superpowers or not???"" buy it."
negative,"Dangerous?: I really liked the Swaddleme fleece swaddle that was given to us when our son was born. As the weather turned warmer and the boy grew, I decided to try this cotton one. I'm not happy at all with it. It stretches too much and doesn't keep him swaddled for long. This morning I woke to his crying only to discover he'd worked the entire thing up his body and wrapped it snugly around his neck. I won't be using it any more."
negative,"A 250 page CV on how Clive James became an intellectual: Having so much enjoyed the first two volumnes in this series, I was not prepared for this turgid list of self improvement. Yes Clive is well read, English and Italian, yes he does know the difference between a Donatello and a Michelangelo, but do we need to know every book he read in the two years, every painting he saw and how it moved him. The simple answer is no. Unfortunately it takes 250 pages to find out.The story of how a drunken extemely funny youth becomes a sober mildly funny old pseud."
negative,"Incomplete: Nice idea, poor execution. It simply does not work well, and is therefore much more trouble than it's worth."
positive,"fantistic: kurt vonnegut is the man. this book is probably the most proper, and yes i mean proper. the tone, the characters and the plot are impeccable."
positive,Explosions in the Sky are great!: My pilates students enjoy the music! It's just instrumental but not the classical variety. Just wish it was an hour long! Have to restart in class.
negative,"Awful: If you really want to hear the exact same songs played note-for-note with screaming vocals and a little more distortion, go ahead and buy it. But in all, this album is terrible. It consists ONLY of poorly rendered covers with no surprises and no artistic changes except for the hardcore screaming.Don't even bother."
positive,"Excellent!: I just loved this book. I started out reading it for a class, but the class was cancelled. I finished it anyway, and I think everyone should read this book. Capitola is sassy and brave and daring and smart.Everything a heroine should be!!"
positive,"Standard for the ""for dummies"" series: I've gone through about half of the book and it follows in line with all the ""for dummies"" books I've read. The topics are well laid out and organized very well. I found some things too simplistic and ended up skimming over them. Overall I'm glad I got it as it reinforced a lot of the things I need to get done in order to get my start-up business going. They do cover both start up from scratch businesses and buying a franchise or another established business. The latter wasn't of interest and I ended up skipping large sections because of it.A good reference for starting a business."
positive,"an adult fairy tale: This is a wonderful musical version of ""Cinderella"", which i may add is not a Children's fairy tale, it has only been reduced down so that children will get the gist of the tale. But back to the movie, it's amazing. musical lovers will be in heaven, i know i was. The music is cheesy but in the way that you love and are too taken for a ride. you won't be disappointed if you're not a man. (if you're a man and enjoyed it, KUDOS!)"
negative,"All of what is BAD: Please tell me it hasn't come to this ... Embarassing film with wooden acting and generic, ""by-the-numbers"" direction and visuals ... Avoid like a plague of poorly done computer bugs ... This is what is wrong with American filmmaking these days ..."
positive,"Luther is passionate!: Luther is the best thing Joseph Fiennes has done in a long time. The movie is incredible. If I could choose one word to describe it, it would be passion. The passion and commitment of Martin Luther was well portrayed in this film. The scenery was also quite wonderful.I will definately buy the DVD when it comes out and I thinking of buying multiple copies for Christmas/birthday gifts.I came away with the feeling that the selling of ""indulgences"" is like saying that Christ's sacrifice on the cross was not enough to pay for our sins; that we have to help him. This is a slap in the face to Christ himself and Christianity."
negative,"OMG, a complete waste of time: Having read the novella Rollerball prior to the first version being made, and having seen that one on the big screen, I awaited the remake. It came & went big screen in near record time. That should have been warning enough. Unfortunately I rented this piece of **** and even worse, I watched the whole thing. All the time thinking, it can't be this bad, it has got to get better. It is that bad, and it never got better. Other than the title, and some aspects of the game, nothing in common witht he original book. Very little in common with the first movie. James Caan vs. who ever he was. No contest Caan. Even Jean Reno is wasted in this mess. Poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorlly shot, poorly edited. And loud, I mean Loud, you know LOUD. I really wanted to give this zero stars, but that was not an option."
negative,"DOA: I bought and donated an X-acto Electric Pencil Sharpener for my daughter's 2nd grade class. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when my daughter brought it back because ""it doesn't do anything, Daddy."" A complete dud."
positive,"You Won't be Sorry!: Go Ahead...indulge in another Bentley Little book. You will find a little bit of everything in it.....and at the end, you WILL have that satisfied feeling of ""now that was a GOOD book!"""
positive,"Witch Of Blackbird Pond is nice: The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Speare is a pretty good book. It's very exciting and there is some romance, I don't see why it hasn't been a movie yet. I wouldn't give it the newberry award, it's good but not that phenomenal."
negative,"DON'T BUY THE BLUE REFILLS !: When buying these refills, try to find out if you are getting the white ones or the blue inserts. The blue ones are very substandard, and break if anything touches the inside of them, leaving leaking holes all throughout. The white ones are tougher bags. I was very disappointed in the last batch I bought (blue)."
positive,"Silicone cover for Palm 755: Quality is a 3, but lets be honest with ourselves, it is a dollar!! For this price, this does it's job extremely well. I use it all day, but when I'm out , I take the case off, its not the most attractive case I've seen.Its a good product for an outstanding price."
negative,Leaks: I've had to throw at least 6 onesies because of the leakage riding up my sons back:( awful my next attempt is to try pampers swaddles while he still fits into their size. Hopefully they work out since there are many good reviews.
negative,"quality of this book: the book is simple and makes the tough parts of econometrics understandable.however some core background topics are lacking... statistical depth for persons without a solid background in statistics. such is found in other texts(see jonston, gujurati, koutsoyannis, intrilligator).furthermore the book assumes prior knowledge of matrices,hence those without a solid background herein,at left at a loss."
positive,"WOOW!....Best book I ever read...: I will never foget this book, mainly because it was the first romance novel I ever read. JULIE GARWOOD IS AN AMAZING WRITER. This book was full of intrigue, heartwarming romance, suspense, adventure, and danger from the beginning to the end. Gillian is sweet, strong and very brave. Broddick is Macho, sexy, sexy sexy!!! did I say sexy! ^^ courageous, and sweet (when he is around Gillian). They make a PERFECT! couple. THE OTHER TWO CHARACTERS: Brigid and Ramsey ( he too, is gorgeous-sexy-sweet and, falls in love with Brigid). THIS BOOK WAS SO AMAZING, I WAS DISSAPPOINTED WHEN IT ENDED!! If you are looking for a romance novel, THIS IS THE BOOK TO READ! WARINING: Do not read this book at night, because you will not be able to sleep. :) :) :) ^^"
positive,"Pretty Good Stuff!: I'm not a big fan of war films, but this is one of the best. The suspense builds and the attack scene is one of the best staged battle sequences I've ever seen."
positive,"If you want action, dont read this: If you want a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat with action and plot twists, then read a comic book. This is one of the slowest books I have ever read. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is truely chilling, how close this book mimics reality. Free speach may not be outlawed here, but when the news media is outraged at someone who is prolife.. or when a TV show has to have either sex, violence, or very rude humor to get good ratings.. or when the most improtant thing on the new is the presidents love life.. it really makes you think about just how close we are to the world F451. Many people hate this book because it is so boring, but i think it is good because it doesnt rely on speedy action or witty catch phrases."
positive,The Fisher King: Pretty good movie...let's face it Robin Williams is a comedic geneous and his serious moments on film are OK too.
negative,"SUCKED: Pointless CD unless u like badly sung ballads that have no meaning worst thing everdo not be persuaded by these ""claymate"" people they are biased and know that clay does infact stink they just can't except it if u know wats good for u STAY AWAY FROM ""MEASURE OF A MAN"""
negative,The worst book that has ever been written: I strongly erge you to get a life if you like this book. It was boring and i could hardly get through it.... uuuhhhhhhhh....i would give it -5 stars but you can't. uuuhhhhhh.
negative,"Zzzzzzzzzzz!: What a snooze-fest. Terribly over-rated. There's so much talk, talk, so many long, long shots of facial expressions that you want to scream: okay, let's have some action! Even the action sequences are akwardly handled. Russell crowe is terrif but Ridley Scott could have borrowed some of the fun from the Steve Reeves muscle epics. This flick takes forever to get started. 'Scuse me while I watch ""Hercules"" starring the incomparable--and vastly more watchable Steve Reeves."
positive,Excellent compilation on Leadershipattributes for innovation: Excellent compilation on Leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well written articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon. I enjoy reading Peter Drucker's books and the content of the book has Peter Drucker's flavor to it. The Clarity and style of this book is truly outstanding.
positive,"Classic literature everybody should read: This book is great history lesson, written with love and passion.Young people could learn many good things about relationship between woman and man."
negative,"Yikes!: I can't understand why anyone would spend 20 years writing thisThe book is incomprehensible. Read a regular book you can understand without having to read it aloudI love Joyce. Portrait, Dubliners, great stuff. Wonderful poetry. He starts to get a bit wonky in Ulysses, but even that is readable (if not altogether understandable - Giffords book is definitely a necessary provision)But why write a book such as the Wake? Didn't he say he thought people would be laughing while reading it?But writing a book noone can understand..He must've been out of his tiny little mind. Couldn't he have written another play, or more short stories about the Eire he loved/despised.It makes no sense to me! Why would anyone want to read what is, basically, a mess. How was this even published? Didn't someone tap him on the shoulder and say, ""Joyce, this makes no sense""Good grief! Joyce was actually a decent writer to this point!"
positive,"smallville season 9: I just love the smallville series. Season 9 is so exciting. Zod,Lois's look into the future,Justice Society, new villians and heros. I couldn't stop watching and looking forward to season 10. Wish Smallville would go on forever."
negative,"Great Name, Inadequate Guage: Arrived fast but the product needed to be calibrated upon arrival. As a matter of fact I've been calibrating this one frequently and it's still lucky to get within 2 degrees of the actual temperature. It just requires too many adjustments and remains too inaccurate. It is big and readable and sticks to the window. Unfortunately this is a case of an inadequate product distributed by a well known name brand."
positive,marvel book: this item that i purchased from amazon.com was great. it got to on time and it was everything that i needed. it has lots of information on marvel charecters and would a great book for any fan.
positive,"excellet: this is what movies are all about, to Be enjoy...a great movie, of suspence based on a greata comic book, for the ones who said the movie sucked,STAY HOME AND READ A BOOK!! dont go out Its bad for you.Peace."
negative,"Mediocre: I'm working on a project about Curie, so I've read several biographies about her thus far. This book isn't absolutely terrible, but I think it handles Curie poorly. It underexplains much about her life and motivations, gives little due to the science behind her work, and goes out of its way to make her ""inner world"" excessively dramatic. Curie's story is amazing and fascinating, but this book sacrifices explanatory detail and historical context in favor of an emotionally simplified (and thus more boring) version of the person. Even the title is misleading -- Curie was dedicated to her work and slightly reclusive, but she was hardly an obsessive personality.I encourage you to please check out the longer but much more engrossing biography by Susan Quinn (titledMarie Curie: A Life (Radcliffe Biography Series)), which provides the historical and scientific context necesssary to make Curie's story really come alive."
negative,"Would Not Play: Tried playing the DVD on two different DVD players without success. I had a VHS copy of this movie years ago and loved the movie. This was a gift for my little nephew. Needless to say, we were very disappointed that this DVD would not play. I contacted the seller, who suggested it may have been a European version, and then left it up to me to figure that out based on looking for either the number ""1"" or ""2"" somewhere on the item description page. I would suggest that sellers make this information more apparent on the item description page when selling to both customers in the U.S. and Europe. It is important to note, as with many Disney movies, this DVD is not in current production and availability is limited. As a result, this item was purchased from an independent seller through Amazon.com. I love Amazon.com and do not feel that Amazon was in any way at fault for the lack of disclosure in the product description for this item."
negative,"revised from original edition: The one star is not really for the novel, but for this edition of it. If, like me, you have read this and are looking to purchase a copy, this has an attractive cover. However, it is not clear from the product description that this edition of the novel is in the form the author originally submitted to his editor, and not the edition originally published. Accordingly, Willie Stark is Willie Talos throughout this novel. Even though this may have been the author's original intention, I absolutely hate that it's a different edition from the novel I read and loved. I will be returning it and purchasing an older edition without this reversion."
negative,"If you know any French, skip this product: The graphics are nice and clear, and it does teach minimum skills for communicating as a tourist; if you want practice with very simple conversations, try it. You'll learn to say and understand things like "" I would like to rent an apartment"". But if you can conjugate verbs, write, read or speak a little in French, don't bother. I can't understand French movies or conversations at regular speeds, so I thought this might help. It did'nt."
positive,Hearing Protection Radio: Good basic unit. Hearing protection is good. Radio works well. I have no reception problems as I live in a large metro area. A little hard to tune in radio stations. I don't change stations much so this is not a big problem for me. Suggest the digtial display unit if you change stations often.
positive,"Great CD!: This is a great cd, showing the traditional side of bluegrass and the direction it is headed! I would highly recommend it."
negative,"Read Something Else: The greatest accomplishment of Christopher Paolini is that he and his family managed to get this thing published and that it found an audience. The writing is terrible, just terrible. I can't comment on the entertainment value this book may hold for some. After about eight chapters of some of the most juvenile prose in print I had to put this aside. There's lots of good, even great fantasy out there awaiting eager readers. They'd do well to skip over Eragon and seek out its betters."
negative,"Bond will always be king of the spy thrillers!: ""XXX"" is a complete knock-off of a Bond film. Nothing is original or entertaining (Eeven the name XXX was copyed from The Spy Who Loved Me). CGI is used way too often, and the plot-line is absolutely dumb! And Vin Diesel really dosen't help the film. Diesel's acting is horrible and film is filled with nonsense scenes.A few weeks ago I saw the new Bond film ""Die Another Day"", and it totally blew ""XXX"" out of the water!"
negative,"Do yourself a favor and pass on this piece of garbage: I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller. Goes to show you some people have really bad taste. The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog. It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc. I would NEVER purchase another book by this author. Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can... Charlie"
negative,"bad ambient music: after all the great mixes over the years, this is a horrible disapointment. i am already selling this back used."
positive,"A masterpiece. Human spirit triumphs over imperial power!: Russel Crowe did an excellent job in this film playing the betrayed general who was sent into the gladiator pits. If you have not seen it, beg borrow or steal it if you have to. It is a must see for any movie fan. Once you have seen it you will want to own it. I have seen it four times and am not planning on stopping there!"
positive,"Wonderful, stylish: I love this book and must disagree with another customer who reviewed it saying that obviously the magazine had nothing to do with it. I know one of the featured designers, who confirmed that he was chosen by the magazine editor to appear in the book. And the long bok introduction is written by the editor in chief herself."
positive,AWESOME MOVIE!!!!: I saw this movie 3 times. It's an incredible movie and is worthy of all the praise it can get. The acting and directing is top notch. Also the story is great. Can't wait to see Bale and Nolan again in a few years.
positive,"Perfectworldsong ist my lovlely song, but all another .....: Yoko Kanno ist my best songwriter,I have all her Music collection"
positive,"Solid, good songwriting: Jakob Dylan will always be in some way compared to his daddy, but now he seems to have gotten past caring about it. Breach gives us a maturing singer/songwriter backed by a laid back but still tight band. It reminds us of the days of yore when musical prowess was a product of thousands of hours of work spent on mastering your craft, not electronic aids and tools but instruments. As refreshing as a cool drink despite offering nothing new, just good music."
negative,"Disappointing start from Conrad: This is Joseph Conrads first novel. It deals with the conflicts between native people (Malayans) and Dutch tradesmen in the jungle of Borneo. It has some brilliant passages, but all in all it's a quite dull read."
positive,"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged.: I have had an old version of this itrem for a long time ago. I wanted to aquire a latest version; so an opportunity came, I bought it. I am very satisfied and happy with this dictionary"
negative,"Great Author but so, so story: I have to admit. I have so high of expectations for Mr. Michener that when he doesn't hit a home run I'm disappointed. This book is OK, it is short compared to all his other books. He only used his old trick once where he reintroduces a character, the one feamle of the book, then brings her back. She was introduced, forgotten, then found stranded in literally nowhere, and rescued by the heroes. Also something different in this book was a chapter of reflection by the author. Many claim the book is about Canada. I sensed very little Canadian, except for the fact that they were traveling through Canada. I believe Mr. Michener could of detailed the Canadian characters a bit more, showing how they came to and adapted to this rugged country."
positive,"Generational Dirty Laundry: Wow! This mesmerizing tale of South Carolina - flashing between 1966 and now is taut and disturbing and compelled me to make a new List: SLEEP? Who Needs SLEEP? Page turners - all night long.It's a ""Who Dunnit"" and a ""Why Dunnit"" and yet a well-crafted cousin to both ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""A Time to Kill."" Don't waste any more time reading these reviews. Rush your little cursor right up there to that ""Add to ShoppingCart"" button and get it now, ya hear?! Reviewed by TundraVision"
positive,Very Exciting Book!: I never wanted to end this book so I bought the second book and I am reading it now! The first book had some sad parts but every thing else was like a roller coaster ride with so much excitement!
positive,"For the youth workers out there: To all my fellow youth workers out there- this is a must see!!! Very honest film, tells it how it is, no sugar coating. You can use it as a tool to explain to the older generation why the youth are acting the way they are, and why they are so put off by organized relegion- and what they can do about it. Must see for parents of teens/students who want their kids involved in churches and faith communities."
positive,My Daughter loves the big girl chair: I love the 5 point harness. My daughter needed to get out of the car seat but still need more than a seat belt. This seat was easy to install and we love it.
negative,"Vanessa is getting weird: There are a few mildly catchy songs, but tracks like ""Half A Week Before Winter,"" which mentions vampires, ""She Floats,"" which seemingly tells the tale of a ghost, and ""The Wreckage,"" which make it seem like Vanessa has a death wish, are too disturbing for me. Vanessa almost comes off as a suicidal Goth at times, and that's just weird. This CD is very dark, making it too different from her first album. And there's nothing as catchy and radio-friendly as ""A Thousand Miles."" The melodies are usually upbeat and catchy, but the album seems bittersweet because of its depressing lyrics. I don't like this as much as her debut."
negative,"what happened to the downtempo groove?: It's got a few good tunes on it, but being someone that was immediately taken by AL by getting 1-7, 7 almost sounds too commercial. It's like 7 was produced by someone else it seems. Lionel Richie's Easy on AL 7 and Marvin Gayes Sexual Healing on AL 6 are great songs, but I just don't think the typical AL buyer is buying the cds for those types of songs. To catch the real downtempo AL vibe, start with the first one, Ambient Lounge 1, and work your way up. I hope AL 8 will go back to its roots.."
negative,"no speacial features: This is a good movie. Just stay away from this version. I was excited and bought it on release day only to find out that it is just the feature film. I was really disappointed. I would never have purchased this movie if I had known that it was the feature only. Yes, I know, in my excitement to get the movie, it was my own fault for not looking carefully at the back of the box, although, nowhere could I find that it says feature film only. I used to download movies illegally. I stopped and started buying them legit again because the special features are really enjoyable. When the companies charge full price for the feature only (which i can get from netflix anyway), I feel cheated. Maybe everyone should start downloading illegally and really send hollywood or whoever a message that if they want our hard earned money they need to work a little harder for it. This is just my rant."
negative,"Worth a look at dicount prices: Certainly not one of Tony's best efforts. Much of the script is laughable, but the story line is better than comparable low budget films from this period.You know the plot. Ancient Egyptian Princess and Priest fall in love, break the rules, get burried alive only to be resurected when archeologists find the un-marked tomb. Like the original Karlof, this mummy looks pretty much normal once the bandages come off.I can't give this one more than 2 stars, but it still has a spot in my movie cabinet!"
positive,"A ticket to mystery: This is not the best of the Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce pairings but nonetheless this is an enjoyable outing.Terror by Night is one of those I put on late at night to watch curled up on the sofa with a cat by my side. The rhythm of the train and the steadfast bond between Holmes, Watson and Lestrade creates one of the most relaxing murder mysteries ever put on film. The deliberate pace may not please all, but to those with a taste for it this is the mystery equivalent of a good house wine."
negative,"Can't Even Bare to read it.....>.<: This book is actually pretty bad.I still haven't finished it(I'm on the part where Eragon is staying at Tronjeihm) because i can't bare to read it. It has waaaay too much dialogue and Paolini doesn't describe the setting or anything enough to picture it in your mind. I've heard many excuses for this book actually being good. Today at school before I wrote this, I told my friend that i was writing a review on Eragon (he has read Eragon and Eldest and loved them). I told him that i hated the book and Paolini copied some names in the books. My friend said, ""Just because they sound almost the same, it doesn't mean he copied them."" Ok here's a little note to Matt(my friend): For one thing there were A LOT of names that Paolini copied. And second, don't you think it's KIND OF odd that they would sound almost exactly the same??? Ok, well I hope you've enjoyed my FIRST book review. And a hint of advice: DON'T GET THIS BOOK!!!"
positive,"Classic Exposition on Reasonable Faith: C.S. Lewis offers here the quintessential book on Christian epistemology. He helps us understand how we know what we know and why we think we know what we claim to know even if what we think we know we really don't know. ;-)Actually, Lewis is tremendously clearer and easier to understand than I am, so stop reading this review and read the book. (Aw, heck, let me finish, after all...) This is a rational, logical, and eternally classic exposition of the faith that will never outlive its usefulness. Even though atheists have managed to wriggle around Lewis's ""liar, lunatic, Lord"" trilemma, the arguments herein contained still offer fodder for the inquisitive brain.This book is a ""must read"" and is concise enough that it actually can be read."
positive,"A must for bookworms!: This light has been so great! I suffer from severe migraines and some of the time I cannot stand to have the main light on in my room. This light has helped me continue reading with no trouble. I have also used it to look around unfamiliar rooms (hotels, relative's home) when I forgot to bring a flashlight.I am planning a trip in May and on my list of things to take with me will be both my light and also extra batteries for it. The batteries are easy to find in most drug stores.And having it in my favorite color is an added bonus!I am so glad I bought this!"
negative,"A FAILED EXPERIMENT: As big a fan as I am of Keith Jarrett, frankly this record is one of my least favorite. Admittedly, it was an experiment of the type you would expect from ECM; but it doesn't work for me. There are sections when Jarrett just plays his keyboard unfettered and these are interesting and enjoyable. The saxophonist, Jan Garbarek, however seems to be an acquired taste-his horn sounds like a loon across a frozen lake. Be that as it may, I didn't enjoy his solos as I normally would any other sax man. The normally dependable Charlie Haden is almost inaudible here. I especially could do without the string orchestra that pops up constantly.Nevertheless, I suppose one has to take this record for what it is: an experiment in a style Jarrett did not go back to. My own brother swears by this record. I swear at it."
positive,excellent: I reccomend all to purchase from amazon .. they are great .. and stand by their word on the speedy delivery
negative,"THIS ITEM DESCRIPTION IS VERY MISLEADING !!!!: This calendar begins with August 2005 and ends with July 2006! My son bought this for me for Christmas and was very dissapointed when I opened it and found out it was 'halfway used up' already. He felt very cheated and I felt very sorry for him. I think it is absolutely terrible that the item is not described truthfully. Shame, shame, shame on you! I wish I could give this item a negative number of stars!!!"
positive,NOT the worst American B-Movie: This movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing. There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don`t trip over the tree roots in the yard. Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what? It was not on a tree root!!!
positive,"Simply, LIFE: This book was suggested to me by a cardiologist before embarking on a career in medicine. It is very deep and talks to your soul about the human condition, and what we share in common. It is hard to walk away from reading this book and not be more reflective and humble. I can see where my friend thought this would be instructive before embarking on a medical career. By the way, cherish when someone republishes books that have been out of print. Either the used books are of poor quality, and falling apart, or very expensive. This is a true classic which I highly recommend to all, young and old."
positive,"An O.K CD!!: I bought this C.d because I heard ""This Kiss"" on GAC I loved it all but my favorite song was ""Let me let go"" Then it seemed as if GAC played it every 5 minutes!!!!!! Overdone!!!!!"
positive,"Interesting and enlightening: This film is very interesting and enlightening. It answers many of the why's and how's how Kinsey's scientific interest into sexology.Be forewarned....if you disapprove of frank discussions about sex, homosexuality, visual depictions of nudity and intercourse, this isn't the film for you.The extra features in the double-disk set are well worth the extra price. They delve more into the real Alfred Kinsey and his fascinating work..."
negative,"LONG and DULL: witch of blackbird pond is a very well written book. it goes into much depth about certain things, however, i feel that is one of the reasons it is only a 2 star book. this book tells a story about a girl who moves into america before the revolutionary war. she has to saty with her only remaining relatives, who do not share the same points of veiw as she, kit tyler, does. kit is acused of being a witch but in the end can not be proven of her suspected withcraft. this book, yet well described, is streched out over to many pages. a lot of unesscesary things go on that one should not need to know. witch of blackbird pond has no real point to me and is a LONG and DULL book"
positive,"Great Book - if you read it all.: This book at the beginning seemed to me a little boring but as i read on it got really interesting. So much irony and so many twists is what really kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one of those books that you look forward to the end but when it comes you sit back and wish there was more. It really makes you think about yourself, society, and the world. I HIGHLY recommend this book."
negative,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED: IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT I SAW ON THIS MOVIE I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT. IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE OLDER MOVIES OF THE MUMMY THAT HELD YOUR INTERST. THIS MOVIE WAS ENTIRELY TOO DULL.
positive,"Kelly Club Pet Parade at HIT!! My Daughter Loves IT!!: My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the ""Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!"" song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids, ""train"" each pet (teach the pony to jump, etc.), clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails, etc.), and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse."
positive,Like Rush? Like Rock and Roll? Like MUSIC? Then buy this!: This is an incredibly well produced documentary about one of the best and most unappreciated rock bands in the world. And it is not intended for hardcore Rush fans only.
negative,"Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road - hello Shlocksville!: ""El Dorado"" fails on all levels. Truly, this is a CD to avoid. Elton's fans should avoid it for the lackluster rhythms, simple chromatic melodies (if you can call them that)and banal Tim Rice lyrics and forced rhymes. Disney film fans - this is NOT Lion King of the Central American Jungle! There is no grand opening melodic sweep like ""Circle of Light"" - instead you've got the moronic repetition of ""El Dorado."" There are no ballads like ""Can you hear the love"" - so there's nothing to compare it to. And the comic songs isn't very clever, although ""It's Tough to be a God"" comes close. One last comment, I could buy the Spanish rhythms - after all the main characters are Spanish - but where the hell did the country/western sound come into the picture at all? Dreamworks, if you want to rival Disney, get Phil Collins to do your music next time."
positive,"Very powerful: We have had this vacuum for about 2 years and it is very powerful. It's also easy to clean with no bags, I just throw the dust out and wash it out. It is a bit heavy and some of the attachments are constantly falling off. But on the flip side the attachments are very powerful as well and suck everything up quickly. I use it on my hardwood floors too."
negative,"doesn't leak but uncomfortable to sleep on: I bought this product because I'm living temporarily in a city and will move to another city later, and don't have the extra money to buy a better bed. Since then my shoulders hurt from sleeping on it. I've lost interested in sleeping after that. Before that i never have problems with sleeping.It's ok to sleep for one or two nights only i guess. If you intend to sleep on it for a few months, buy a comfy bed instead of this!"
positive,Cowboy snuggie...: I gave this poncho as a birthday gift to my husband. He loves it so much he wears it while he watches TV. Of course he falls asleep wearing it! I recommend it highly.
positive,"A wonderful tool: Lisa has been a long time associate of mine and for someone who has been using Kettlebells for many years, Lisa's DVD is one of the MOST helpful and effective instructional video for those with multiple experience with Kettlebells from those who are new to KB's to those of us who have molded our fitness programs after Kettlebells. Thank you Lisa for continueing to put out great fitness info to the community! You're a gem in the fitness world! Keep up the great work!BenYou can also follow Lisa on YouTube, just run a search for Kettlebell Bombshell or Lisa Balash.BUY THIS DVD!"
negative,"""Dude, Where's My Brain?"": I despise this movie. I really do believe my dog's life is more interesting than this. ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" makes you wish you hadn't paid a whopping two dollars to rent it and it also makes you wonder if anyone actually likes this. Dude, a tsunami crashing down on my head would've have been more fulfilling than sitting through this movie. It really needs to go away forever and never come back."
negative,"Great story, poorly written: Pararescue has all the elements of a great true-life rescue adventure: Painstaking research reveals a story of real heros working in impossible conditons against an implaccable natural foe, who face overwhelming odds in attempting to rescue merchant seamen in peril.Unfortunately, the account is written in a droning first-person narrative that is a chore to read. What could have been a bestseller reads more like the voice-over script for a television documentary.Only the fact that the true story is itself gripping enabled me to slog through the clumsy writing to experience this tale of bravery and heroism."
positive,"The Best of the Tuna Helpers: All the Tuna Helpers are excellent, but the Tetrazzini is the best in my view. Oddly, the one package I used of my shipment from Amazon did not have the extraordinary flavor of the one I purchased in our local store. Since my original purchase, my local store does not carry the Tetrazzini Tuna Helper. I am willing to accept that the one package I purchased from Amazon was not a true sample of the excellent Tetrazzini put out under the Tuna Helper label. Since the product is, I assume, made the same way each time, I expect the balance of the boxes I purchased to exhibit the same flavor as the first box I purchased from my local store."
negative,"Stupid. That's all I can say.: Well, not really. I hate the book for all the classic reasons.1. Ripoffs, of course2. I've seen better character development in Garfield3. The Old Language words sound like the gibberish that someone would make up when they're losing at Scrabble.4. Dialogue sucks. You can tell Paolini would sit and stare at the computer for long moments, trying to figure out what to say next.5. Too many chapters involve Eragon losing consciousness. The almighty Dragon Rider has never finished a fight!6. Eragon learns about swordsmanship and magic too quickly. Saphira becomes mature too quickly.7. I'd go on, but I've gotta go. C YA!"
positive,"Bronson in his best: Great film, Charles Bronson on a one man war on the drugs trade.The body count is high and Bronson rules the streets as his tracks down the villians one by one."
negative,"Jams, eats pencils: Lousy quality for the money -- easily jams, ""eats"" about 4 times more from the pencil than other sharpeners -- a pencil is consumed after just about 4 sharpenings! And yet -- one side of the pencil tip still has wood on it! Plastic gears, does not appear to be very durable. *No one* makes good quality electric pencil sharpeners anymore -- the best choice is to buy a *vintage used* Brother or Panasonic pencil sharpener."
negative,They Say Its Rated NC 17...WHY: There Was Not Really That Much Sex In The Film. There was some brutal language Butr Not that much in sex. This film was not at all what they all said it to be. I myself is into love stories such as this and if your a fan like me...dont get this. but dont take my word for it
positive,"Getting Started in Consulting by Alan Weiss, PhD: This is a must-have book for the right person. It is written by a professional for professionals though anyone with expertise in any discipline who's considering self-employment can benefit from much of the information. I have an MBA and recently retired after 27 years with the same firm; one would think with an MBA such a book would not be needed but it is loaded with valuable information and references that will jump-start any venture into self-employment and especially consulting.I have the 2000 edition and I've ordered the 2009, after comparing the two, I'll come back and update this review."
negative,"Replacement Disc: If you have the packaging with the white (as opposed to yellow) bar code background, you probably have the defective disc.You need to mail disc one to:PHE MKTC/O DELUXE MEDIA MANAGEMENTPO BOX 801464VALENCIA CA 91380-1464Their phone number is 1.888.889.9456They will send you a free replacement disc within two weeks."
negative,"Three Hours and Seven Dollars I'll Never Get Back...: This was the absolute WORST movie I have ever seen. I actually warn people in the video store when I see them about to rent it. One guy rented it despite my warning and the next time I ran into him he said he wished he'd listened to me. WHO TOLD MILLA JOVOVICH SHE COULD ACT????????????Awful, awful movie."
negative,"Miracle-Gro 100410 lawn and garden feeder: Good idea but poorly made. I followed instructions and hooked the feeder to my garden hose using city water. All was good till I let go of the trigger, then water leaked badly from the handle and trigger area. It became useless at that point. Will need to take back for a refund. Why should any product fail on the first use..... it shouldn't. Stick with the liquid feeder it seems to work better."
negative,"Burned outlet: I've had my unit for about a year. It was plugged into a wall outlet. Today I noticed that the unit was on the floor and that the outlet was scorched. The unit itself was burned around the prongs. There have been no power surges/outages, etc., so the only conclusion is that the unit itself is faulty. I'm grateful that it didn't start a house fire."
negative,"I liked it better when Flop recorded it.: Sorry tigerbutter boy. If I want to listen to Flop songs, I'm going to put ""Fall of the Mopsqueezer"" into my CD player."
negative,"Love the camera but buyers BEWARE!!!: I love everything about this camera BUT....The display is very touchy. I only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke. I had it in a case and must have bumped it just right. My display shattered. Mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of. This is NOT covered under your warranty. My camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet. So I am sitting here with no camera, which is really bothersome since I Love taking pictures. I figured I would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen! So I highly recommend this camera but you MUST be VERY VERY careful with it!"
positive,"Definitely a Cd to own.: From the first time I heard Liam belt out ""Live Forever"", I was hooked. This CD really ushered in britpop as we all know it, and defined the middle part of the last decade. Some five years on, it's a CD that is standing up beautifully. Definitely Maybe is full of raw energy and punk attitude all the way through. Classic tracks like Live Forever, Slide Away, and Supersonic, are instantly catchy and powerful. I also really love the gem, ""Married With Children"", (about the only soft song on the disc). Like them or not, the Oasis boys really made one hell of a rock record. The disc is full of past styles and refences, not just the Beatles, but a bit of the Stones, T-Rex, and The Sex Pistols for good measure. This cd is Definitely one of the decade's best. No if's, and's, or maybe's."
negative,"Great Book For Men to Read As Well: I read this book to learn what women think about men and what they think in general about relationships. As an avid student of the Art of War, I think this is a most read for all men that are willing to prepare themselves fully in how to recognize the tactics that women slavishly follow or how to mimic the kinds of men they are looking for. Yes, this is deception, however it is exactly this kind of strategem that the author of this book, Sherry Argov, is promoting. Men used to work hard at guessing what was behind women's motives. Now the task is easy, as women are writing more and more books and in the process, revealing more and more in the process about themselves."
negative,"If you live in the year 2000, ignore this book: What a pathetic and banal depiction of humanity. It's nice to know that anybody with a pea-brain perspective on management can churn out a bestseller; albeit sad to know that the brainless masses buy into it.Do yourself a favor and read Napoleon Hill and Carnegie for direction. This book is horrible."
positive,"The best fantasy I've ever read.: THE SWORD IN THE STONE is just about the best fantasy that I have ever read. It is a story of the childhood of Wart, later known as King Arthur, and is filled with delightful adventures that fulfill childhood dreams-such as becoming a owl and being able to fly. Not only that,but this book is also filled with the wonder and the wisdom of T.H.White. To read it is an undescribable experience.I recommend it uncondoitionally to all lovers of fantasy"
negative,"Horrible DVD transfer: Its in a 4:3 letterbox format, and is just a horrible transfer.Please update this wonderful movie with a better DVD/BluRay disk."
negative,"Zero Stars - These leak!: These are terrible for night use. We used them at night for a week, and they leaked at least half of the nights. Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive are much better."
negative,"Fantastic book, absurd price (Kindle edition): How do the publishers or Amazon get away with this? While I love The Hobbit dearly, and consider LOTR to be my favourite book, the pricing of the Kindle edition is ridiculous. It is *more* than the price of the hardback! I was considering picking up an electronic copy of the book for moments when I just want to dip into this classic and I'm away from home, but I won't be taken for a ride like this."
negative,Read the small print before you buy: I ordered these as a gift. I had to pay about $7 shipping. They did not fit the recipient. I did not know about the 15 day return policy or the 15% restocking fee. Now I owe more shipping (must be insured) and the fee. That is a total loss of about $23 for nothing. And I ordered these early to beat the Christmas rush. Now I have one day left to return them - Christmas Eve. Read the small print. I will not buy from a company that sells through Amazon again.
negative,"Average historical fiction marred by numerous errors: The plot and characterization of this WW2 thriller are handled reasonably competently, but it has too many errors to allow the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy a book like this. It may sound pedantic but to enjoy these sort of boys books, I at least need to feel confident that the author knows what he is talking about. Two of the more frequent and irrating errors: British (and British derived) air forces do not use army ranks but have their own air force ranks. Thus Mr Meade's air force captain would in fact have been a Flying Officer. And Lieutenant Colonels are addressed as and call themselves ""Colonel""."
negative,"Ouch...Airplane II pains me.: No audio commentary to find out what the director was thinking...Airplane II is a travesty. Even if the movie hadn't hastily re-staged almost all the same jokes, excluded the presence of Leslie Nielsen, and generally just sucked...it gets major horror points for having, at least on the VHS copy, a short animation after the credits saying ""Coming Next Year from Paramount Pictures: Airplane III!"" Obviously, someone thought it was going to be a hit...they were wrong. I honestly laughed once at this film, at the classic viewscreen gag performed by William Shatner. What a waste of a lot of people's time."
positive,great sharpner: I use it in my workshop to keep all my pencil razor sharp.it's a great sharpener but for some reason I have to add 6 more words to submit this review...bumb aah
positive,"Powerful Insight - A Must Read for Serious Clinical Hypnotists: Steven has given us a truly special mind model to understand disease and healing. As I move forward with the work I do in hypnosis and setting the groundwork for healing I will refer back to this book often for insight and strength. As a piece of literature Steven's passion and personal knowledge through his experiences far surpasses the presentation, but this is an offering of love for mankind and not meant to be a bestseller. This book is for the serious hypnotist who really desires to do great work with clients, rather than merely give direct suggestions. Very powerful. Very important book.George Guarinowww.HypnosisWorksWell.com"
positive,Very good book!: The story is very fast aced and keeps you entertained all the way. Highly recommend it specially if you plan on watching the movies.
negative,"complete sxxxt: I have a bad habit of buying films before i see them and sometimes it pays off. Donnie darko, trainng day and memento to name just a few but then you get that film that is so awful, your embarressed to have it in your dvd collection. This is that film. To summarise: Worst storyline of any action film ever, some of the worst acting i have ever seen,Vin diesel is awful as an an action hero and it is shot very badly as well making it look [bad]. Stay away form this [movie] unless you are an american, as apparently they like this sort of [thing]."
negative,"all-round disappointment: I'm a big fan of Costello, a big fan of Bacharach, and through Deep Dead Blue, became a fan of Frisell. This combination seemed too good to be true, and actually, I was so looking forward to hearing it as one piece that I saved listening to it until I had a long car journey.Sadly, the Sweetest Punch is much less than the sum of the parts.I understand that Bill recorded it without hearing Elvis & Burt's finished album. I wish he'd waited and used it as inspiration, as The Sweetest Punch is neither sweet nor punchy. Instead it is passionless, routine and flat. Moreover it's just dull if you compare it to the rich, elegant, touching soundscapes of Painted From Memory.I am surprised that as someone with so much creative control over his output, Elvis didn't take Bill aside and suggest re-mixing or re-recording or simply not releasing.Sad really."
negative,"Well made but too small: My daughter chose this messenger bag because of the print, but we hadn't realized it wasn't a regular size messenger bag. That was our mistake for not looking at the product dimensions, but it never occurred to me that a bag labelled as a ""messenger bag"" would be so small. She cannot fit her folders or homework book in it. We have found another use for it, but she was disappointed nonetheless."
positive,"If you are angry at God read this book: I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone. The protagonist is angry at the gods for the problems in her life. She questions their existence and condemns them for their arbitrary nature due to the difficulties that she faces.As I read this work I could see many of less desirable traits I possess in the protagonist. I, like many people I suppose have bemoaned ""why me"" and ""when oh Lord is it my turn"". Reading this book provides a mirror of such emotions.I highly recommend this work for anyone but especially for someone who might wish to indict the Gods."
positive,"Worked as advertised, excellent seller: Bought these to use with my PS3 and they worked without any issues. Cable is well made, specially for the amount payed, but don't expect anything fancy. I would definitely buy them over the more expensive brand ones. For some reason USPS shipped incorrectly, I emailed seller and got another cable sent out. I would definitely recommend cables and seller."
positive,"Don't waste your money on it: I do admit that this is a fun toy, it has a catchy tune, and it is fun for my son to push it's nose and play with the colorful balls.But this is definitely not a walker specially on hard wood floors, the walker moves faster than my son, and the handles are a bit far away to reach. To close the seat and make it a ride is semi easy, but good luck opening it back up.As a ride on toy, it is also not that good, the wheels only go straight and my son slides of the seat easily."
positive,"simply a very funny movie.: THis movie is very""stupidly"" funny. This movie is full of dumb but great comedy. Ben Stiller and Vince Van are execellent in this movie. Ben Stiller plays the owner of a very cocky gym that doesnt think anyone is good the way they are. Aside from being like evil, he's very funny""example he has a spot on his pants that blows up to make his thing* bigger when hes around girls which is always funny. Vince Van plays the owner of ""average JOes gym"" where everyone is said to be good the way they are. He is probley the best part of the movie and is very funny. Ben trys to buy out average Joes and vince needs to raise money to save it from him. Somehow the only solution is to play dodgeball and win the national championship to win 50,000$ to keep the gym. THis movie will suprize you till the very end. Its a great movie."
negative,"Not the Best Version: While Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark is a classic children's book, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, and find the original version with Stephen Gammell's illustrations.Alvin Schwartz's words and Stephen Gammell's drawings simply go together, and your children deserve to be treated to the full and correct experience granted by the combination of Schwartz and Gammell.Yes, Gammell's illustrations are more frightening, though no more graphic, than Helquist's. But that is the point! Gammell's work is more effective, it is REAL art, not merely illustration.For the sake of your children's AESTHETIC development, do the right thing!"
negative,"The worst historical fiction I've ever read: I am astonished that this was published...it's truly awful, historically inaccurate. It reads like the author read a couple of books about the period, took notes and then forgot all the facts on record. Anne was the younger sister, for example. There is no record that she ever committed incest with her brother George. The early years at the French court are omitted, which provide an insite as to why the Boleyns began their rise to power."
positive,"Excellent dark farce: 4.2 starsShort version: The man who directed What About Bob? and did the voices of Miss Piggy, Kermit and Yoda makes a comedy about a funeral featuring accidental psychedelic ingestion and an extortionate gay midget (sorry, dwarf). If that doesn't pique your curiosity, this is not for you.Slightly longer version: Wonderfully off the wall British drawing-room farce writ somewhat large, with perfectly silly script and superlative cast. Director Oz was raised in Britain and it shows; he melds dry Brit wit with some of the better Hollywood tropes and dishes up an oft hilarious film that gets funnier as it goes, and at a pleasantly snappy pace. Tudyk is especially marvellous as the unknowing voyager.A must for any fans of British humor, gleeful weirdness, and intelligent dry wit in general."
positive,"Nice Shape: The book was in great shape, very minty! Demystified books really have excellent ways of relaying the message definitely a great study aide"
positive,"This Movie Just Plain Out Kicked!: WOW, this was a great one. The scenery was absoluty amazing. The Roman Collesium brought back to life! The fight scenes for all you action junkies were the best I've seen in a while! The plot was well made. Not enough can be said about this movie. One of the greatest of all time. It's your duty as a movie watcher to go out and see this one or pick it up on DVD! The DVD has great special interviews and a lot more good stuff. Hooray for Gladiator!"
negative,strong smell of oil: This heater was used in a playroom in the basement. I loved the wheels because I could easily put it away when the kids were in the room. But the smell of oil was so strong I decided to return it. I called DeLonghi customer service and they told me any oil filled heater will smell like oil - especially when in the MAX setting.
negative,Questionable at Best: 2 Lb Canada Green Grass Lawn Seeds Seed MixtureI had a lawn with several spots and hoped this would be a good reseed of those spots. Well to this point No Luck. It's been three weeks and nothing is noticable I did a 10' x 25' area to test. I am patient and will give it another two weeks but doubt that I will waste the time to use the what is left. The bag is supposed to cover 1000 sq. ft. I used a third of it for 250 sq. ft. Alas still bare spots.
negative,"Very, very difficult to care.: This book came to me very highly recommended. I gave it my best effort. I'm highbrow, I mean, I can endure all kinds of dull things if there's lurking merit, but I couldn't endure this. The characters are flat. The narrator is about as likeable as that of _American Psycho_. It's Cheever without the wit. Old-school New Yorker types leading New Yorker lives. I couldn't stand listening to this woman if she was sitting next to me in a restaurant or coffee shop and for the same reason I don't want to read a book from her point of view: She has nothing to say. So, zero points for content, maybe half a point for eloquence. The back page, rather than profile the author, describes the font in which the book is printed, and if it was worth my time I'd explore the ways in which that's appropriate for this abysmal, cheerfully decadent story collection."
positive,Razer charger: works amazing in my car without any problems. Lights up a bright blue when charging and actually chargers my phone up.
positive,GREAT add-on!: Great add-on for the Yamaha receiver! It is nice to be able to display your playlists and songs on the television screen and control with the remote control. Well worth the money.
positive,Holding On to Your Dreams: What an excellent book! It has changed my way of thinking about my goals. It has inspired me to get up and achieve my dreams
positive,Toddler Tub: We purchased a toddler tub and it was extremely slippery. This product saved the day by being soft enough for my child's skin while having enough traction to keep him from falling over. Great product!
negative,Too much sappy romance and not enough real drama. Lots of things in the movie went unanswered.: I love suspense but unfortunatly this just didn't quite live up to my expectations. Maybe I'm too used to seeing the mom in this movie as the wife of Jack Bauer in 24. I felt like this movie was more for teenagers. Too much sappy romance and not enough real mystery. I fast forwarded most of it just to get to the end. A lot of questions remained unanswered apparantly since the movie quit production after the last season. I was very disappointed with the ending. Their were too many parts of the movie that made absolutely no sense because the events just never got brought up again towards the end.
positive,Incredible Book!: The MVT process outlined in this book will benefit every organization. MVT greatly accelerates learning. Imagine being able to quickly distinguish the initiatives that are doomed to failure from those that are destine to be wildly successful. Learning in a few months what you previously had not been able to learn in five years.The mountains of examples in the book make it clear that MVT can effectively be applied to any goal.
negative,GOOD MOVIE BUT BAD ENDING: THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD FROM THE START ONCE IT ENDED IT SUCKEDTHE ENDING MESSED UP THE WHOLE MOVIE AND THEY COULD OF HAD SHOW THE MONSTER MOREAND HAVE A BETTER ENDING!
positive,Great Packaging; CD seems fine: This is a gift and the packaging was appropriate and the CD appears to be undamaged. The song themselves are quite good too.
positive,"wonderfull book: this book has many symbolisim,and it is mainly about human behaviors. It shows that humans can not live without rules or how humans behave without rules. It can also be read as a political level. what i like best was the clarity of the book,the style of his writing and how the story was plot. To me, i think this is a very good book and that it should be highly acknowledged. lord of the flies is a wonderfull, symbolic, and a good book. I LOVE IT"
negative,"Creative idea, but a waste of money: We tried this product when our son was 2 weeks of age, but he broke right out of it within minutes and the velco scratched his skin up a little bit. Plain old receiving blankets are much nicer to use and are more multi-purpose unlike this product."
positive,"Strangely Depressing: While I loved the book and its concepts, it left me feeling rather depressed about the characters. It was written well and really got the author's philisophical views across, developing characters well."
negative,"not worth it: This case offers very little protection, and most of the phone is exposed. Not worth it..."
positive,"LOVE this toy: I got this as a shower present and immediately placed it on the crib. At first my daughter merely stared at it and as she great she started playing with different buttons. My daughter is now 15 months old and she loves her acquarium. She really likes the music and likes to hear it as she goes to sleep. Sometimes, when she wakes up in the middle of the night looking for her pacifier, she turns the music on and goes back to sleep. Wonderful gift!"
negative,"NOT THE VHS VERSION!!!: Buyer beware! I bought this under the assumption that it would be the original VHS version with the original soundtrack. The cassette I purchased was not. The case looks professional, but the label on the cassette was a home-printed Avery label. This didn't inspire confidence. Upon actually watching the movie, I first noticed that there was no intro. After about 1.5 seconds of black, the movie just started... Highly unusual for a professionally done VHS. Throughout the film I also noticed a lack of sound effects that would be expected from the DVD, as well as many instances of skips and jitters. At the end, the credits rolled and then a screen came up that said ""JWIN DVD VIDEO"" with a little ""play"" arrow in the upper corner, etc. The copy that I received was just the DVD copied over to VHS. Keep a sharp eye out!"
positive,"Where we're coming from: This is a book that tells a story i always thought must be there, but no one ever talked about. This is the other side of the Religious Culture Wars that we've heard so much about in the last years -- but this is the history of the side that has not claimed its length and depth. Find out where liberal religions have come from. Read this book."
negative,Dont' waste your $$$...breaks within 6 months!: We bought this showerhead so it could help our skin and my dd's eczema. It was great while it lasted but now cracked in 2 places and is unusable. I can't believe I paid over $60 for it!
positive,"Great hit: I had never heard of author Christopher Paolini before but I had seen the book recommended on a list that included Robert Stanek's magnificent The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reach as a great new fantasy. Based on the strength of that recommendation, and the fact I loved Stanek's books, I picked this up.When I first started reading the book, I wasn't too sure if I was going to enjoy it or not, but I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. The book really surprised me. Eragon is well thought out character and the book has a great plot. I definitely encourage anyone who likes fantasy books to try this one out. I recommend this book to people who like magic, fantasy and a moderate amount of action. Very highly recommended. Kim"
positive,"Hilariously Funny!: Knowing the music well but never having the opportunity to see Joseph on Broadway, I was thrilled to buy this video. The only things I would change are the narrator and the outfits worn by Pharaoh's women! Yikes! Otherwise I found it entertaining, hilarious and well put together -cheesy props and all! This is typical Andrew Lloyd Webber and I LOVE IT!"
negative,"no u bolts: dont be fooled by the picture there are no u bolts that come with this ""kit"". change the picture and me it less deceiving and the product would be fine"
positive,"Great band!: Video killed the Radio Star. If this music came out in 1968, this band would have been a headline act. However in the MTV world, if your not pretty, you don't play. I recommend these guys to everyone."
positive,"A great introductory text for Quantum Mechanics: This is a great introduction to Quantum Mechanics with the right doses of math, physics and good prose. It is what the title says it is: an introductory text for the people that is curious about QM. Griffths does not avoid the controversial issues on the physical interpretation of the theory ( a part of the book that should have appeal even to the non-technical reader ). His treatment of the topics is always illuminating and gives the reader a sensation of understanding what he/she is being told.Maybe Professor Griffths would consider next an up-to-date and extended edition of his Elementary Particle book and/or a new text on Quantum Field Theory."
negative,"tastless movie: I have heard great things about Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. This was just not my cup of tea. I thought the singing and the characters were horrible. Some of the clothing was very suggestable in my opionion. I would not recommend this video at all. Though others who gave it a bad review, said they had seen better ones done live. So i am going to try to keep an open mind and try to go to a live one in a theater near by, where maybe I will be able to see what everyone is talking about. The whole movie just left me bored and wasn't a movie that inspired my and my faith. It was cheesy to say the least."
positive,"Yes, It Was Just a Text Book to Me: I purchased this item because I had to for one of my classes. However, I found it to be a great textbook full of lots of interesting information. Cultural Anthropology is full of great pictures and up to date information. Kottak gives a large perspective to the eyes of the world we live in. There is so much beyond the country we live in, and Kottak shows that quite wel.It shows the importance of culture and how it is passed from generation to generation. The biggest thing I probably learned from this book is that you are not born with beliefs and culture, it is learned from others.Pros:Full of informationWell describes cultures around the worldColorful pictures that fit the topicGood as a college textbookWritten by an experiences anthropologistCons:It was just a textbook to me...Not exactly entertaining material"
negative,"It was BOMB In 78', and it's still a BOMB.: Oh, please! Some of these reviewers giving this turkey 4 stars is like saying Andrew Stevens was an acting genius of his time. I saw this flop when it first came out, and I distinctly remember the crowd walking out after saying how bad it was.Time hasn't helped this DePalma mess out either, unless you're into getting in a few laughs at the dialogue, acting and especially terrible effects. Anybody who claims this as anything close to ""Carrie"" needs a serious MRI done, because the closest this flop is to that classic, is the actors (if you consider Amy Irving an actress) and the extra buckets of fake blood. It's also painful watching Kirk Douglas and John Cassavetes reading lines off each other, fully knowing, it's all for the paycheck.Please, if you want to view a decent DePalma flick, pick up ""Dressed To Kill"" of ""Blowout"". Both more superior than this lame duck."
negative,"Not a book I'd recommend: This book was required reading in my honors english class. When I first recieved a copy I thought it looked interesting and different. In the beginning I wasn't really drawn into the book, like so many other's I've read. I read on, thinking it would get better. I was wrong. In fact it just got worse. I couldn't relate to the characters. I mean a girl who hears music in her head, a man exploring his femine side, a Deaf-mute, and a man who is half the time drunk and the other half trying to start a revolution. It did have some good parts but not enough to make it worth the read."
positive,"for neo-swing, it's great stuff!: Cherry Poppin Daddies! Another one of my favorite swing bands. However, these guys are a little more hardcore than anybody else... lyrics are a little fun to listen to, as the name of the band can imply. The tempos are a little more variant, ranging from a nice slow gander to a fast lindy. But the music is still excellent! As mostly original songs, this album can give quite a bit of spice to a night of swingin. The band does have a few other albums, I believe, but as hardcore as these people are, I think this cd (a compilation of their best music) is just the right amount of their kind of swing music. It is a little more modern than all the other swing bands... but that's also what's fun! Check it out. You'll like it!"
negative,"Just watch the first 10 minutes the rest is drying paint: 2 big complaints:1. great start with the archive video of the moon race, including references to NASA, Sputnik, and the Soviet moon probes. No story to follow.2. Dumb girl, ""eek!"" Really beautiful, but never physically confronts these huge machines. Hey, the guys are just as unmatched as she. She is shown at the start at resourceful & smart. Give her something! Her only power was in gossiping to the bad bots to play mind games.One small complaint:The little boy in me would love to see the transformers build into some mega bot, like Power Rangers do, or to use some junk around them to add to their arsenal."
negative,"Gluten Sensitive? Celiac? WARNING: after reading reviews on what a great product it was, and no mention of gluten whatsoever, I thought, ""What the hell?"" and ordered some.it shipped quickly and arrived just as they said it would in such a cute little can.I coated some catfish and panfried it.it was DELICIOUSBUTI havent felt well since. This is a SERIOUS trigger for celiac symptoms GOOD LORD, the bowel problems alone, its bad enough practically living in the bathroom but when you add mutating skin (though i think the green spots are kind of interesting) and bleeding out the eyes, it's just INTOLERABLE.I have sent complaint letters to the manfacturer and to amazon with no satisfaction whatsoever. The seller wont reply to me, and amazon just keeps saying that per third party seller agreements, I need to take it up with them."
positive,Looking for solutions manula for this edition: I was wondering if anyone knew where I could find the solutions manual or selected answers for this book.if you do would you please contact me atRobert.mcnulty@colorado.eduThanks
positive,Loved this movie: I have always loved this movie. I feel it is child friendly and quite entertaining.
negative,"Great for native japanese speakers: First I have to say I am disappointed that I ended up buying a Drama Audio CD instead of a OST. While I love the Karin Anime, spending the money on something I do not fully understand is a bit aggravating.All that aside, I'm sure the CD will be a treat to listen to. It unfortunately means my imagination will be in overdrive most of the time trying to create some semblance of what is happening.If you are a devoted Karin fan who likes collecting Japanese Audio Drama CDs, this is for you.If you're looking for the actual Background Music to the Karin series, you'll have to look elsewhere. You could start with www.play-asia.com. However, with Amazon.com always updating and changing, you may be able to find what you're looking for.Enjoy! ^_^"
positive,"Just in time for the John Carter movie.: After seeing the preview for the new John Carter movie, I decided to go back and reread the Edgar Rice Burroughs, ""Mars"" series. I'm glad I did. The thrilling tales of battle, adventure, and love on the red planet are just as great as I remembered them. John Carter is a fantastic hero and his name should be right up there with Conan, Elric of Melnibone, Drizzt D'ourdan, and Han Solo.A Princess of Mars"
positive,"One of my all-time favorites: If you are interested in Renaissance Italy, gender studies, or the history of the Christian Church, this book is for you. This book presents the story of an ambitious abbess on the road to sainthood a la Catherine of Siena and her fall from grace as she becomes too powerful for the comfort of her male collegues. It is the story of the making and unmaking of a saint. This is one of my favorite books of all time."
positive,"great quick workout: I love this DVD. I had it a couple of years ago, and lost 50 pounds. It got stuck in my DVD player, and I went without for a long time. I bought it again, and it is my favorite workout. I just love it. I am 210 pounds, so I cant do a really long workout yet, but I started back at 227, so I have lost some weight. your whole body will be sore! Even when I got down to 190 last time I had it, I just bought wrist and ankle weights to increase the intensity. Its fun, its a good workout, and its not too long. Its also really cheap!"
positive,"Silky Smooth Brook...: Brook Benton has one of those smooth singing styles along with Sam Cook, Nat King Cole and John Gary that just wraps itself around a song and makes you want to hear it over and over again. This particular collection is home to some of my favorite songs from my pre-teens. My dad was a Brook Benton fan and through him I learned to appreciate a song sung the way it was meant to be. The string arrangements that accompany Benton's awesome voice are nothing short of perfect. You rock-n-roll fans (that includes me) may scoff at this music style, but given a fair chance Brook Benton will win you over...I guarantee it!"
positive,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: Our granddaughter requested this for Christmas, since it features one of her favorite young actors, as well as continues the saga of Harry Potter. Fast service and a superior product."
negative,"What an annoying movie: I guess those who enjoy movies from a box-seat of film-critiques find this movie superb, and I kind of get their points. It's a classic in its theme, content and emphasis on the story. But acting itself was centered on one person--the male protagonist. The female character was lacking in her skill as an actress. Also I find it annoying the way most French movies keep ranting about love. Give me a break! Love this, love that, yak yak, dreamy intellectualism and what not. I suggest you pass, unless this is a required movie for your Film 101 class."
positive,"Perfect for variety: This was bought for us as a gift and we are so thankful for it! My mom got it for us while I was pregnant because I was trying to avoid caffeine as much as possible, while my husband still wanted his daily morning dose. This coffee maker is the perfect solution and allows us both to have what we want / need. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the cost of the K-cups. I anticipate that once we're both ""on caffeine"" we'll go back to our regular coffee maker due to the cost savings we'll see. But, the Keurig will still be nice to have for those occasions when only one of us wants a cup of coffee and we don't want to make an entire pot."
positive,"A big Nelson fan from Texas: Nelson is great. I loved after the rain cd. Imaginator is awesome. I love the songs, kiss me when i cry, sooner or later, we always want what we can't get, tell me. If you liked their 1st cd you will love this."
negative,"Poor movie: The Extreme is smaller than I could expect.I was expecting to see a better overall quality as well, on the scenes, sequences and theme."
positive,"Vanchman's book shiznack: The Transall Saga by Gary Paulsen is a superb book. It takes place in the past on what appears to be a different planet. A young boy named Mark gets bitten by a snake and falls into a big blue light and is transferred into a new time. I encourage the people who are reading this to buy or get this book at a library or a book store, because once you start to read this book, you will never want to put it down."
negative,DEFINETELY NOT FOR ME: I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT AND HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ABOUT AND STILL HAVE NEVER WATCHED IT BUT WAS TOLD IT WAS NOT THAT GREAT - ALOT OF UNFIT STUFF BUT I SHOULD HAVE CHECKED ABOUT IT BEFORE I BOUGHT IT. MY NIECES HUSBAND ASKED FOR IT AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO GET SO I GOT IT BUT WOULD NOT BUY IT AGAIN.
positive,Beautiful watch for the Beautiful girl in life: i bought this watch for my wife. she loved it at first sight. it was a perfect fit color wise and size wise. very sophisticated looking. she felt compelled to remove it while taking a bath although it is fully waterproof. the chain is a little flimsy and has fallen loose once. i want to have it welded. also the chain anchor has attached itself to clothing and cardigan twice. this is unavoidable and we just have to be patient and separate them slowly. i would give it an additional star if the gold plating does not fade in a few months.
negative,"Not what I was hoping for............: I was disappointed in this package. There was no rhyme or reason, no direction, no coaching on where to begin. I was hoping to use it for my teenager and she was completely lost. If you want to learn the mechanics of the language, don't buy this package. If you simply want to memorize a bunch of phrases and words in French, I guess its ok. Definitely not what I expected for software in todays interactive environment"
positive,"Lord of The Flies: Lord of the Flies is a literary classic written by William Golding in 1954. Although it's been 50 years, his story remains timeless. It deals with the pure essence of what it is to be human, and how it is to loose that humanity. The event begins as a group of boys find themselves alone on a deserted island after a severe plane crash; they are quickly drawn toguether by a conch blown by Ralph. Since the very beggining of the book a conflict of interest is noted between Ralph, the leader; and Jack, the hunter. This conflict does nothing but expand and broaden, until finally all hell breaks loose. Lord of the Flies is more than a story, it's a walking breathing epic of symbolism, as colourfull, lively and destructive as the human race itself."
negative,"Bad Eidos, Bad!: Oh. My. God. I remember when Tomb Raider first came out, and my husband and I got it on the original PlayStation. It was great, for 1995. We got Angel of Darkness for our computer, and WHOA! It looked like Eidos had REGRESSED! The animation is choppy, jumps (basically all moves, in general) are hard to control and judge, and I read on a review for the PS2 version that you'd better come to love the phrases ""save successful"" and ""load successful"" because that's what you'll do, over and over and over! It's completely ridiculous how bad the game looks and plays. Holy cow, and the Glitches! At one point in the church, if you move Lara to JUST the wrong spot then the game gets stuck on the two boxers in the ring fighting, and you have to reboot the computer to get out of it! This game wasn't even worth the discounted price I picked it up for. Don't buy it, it's a trick..."
negative,"Rather boring.: This film tries to be scary and I feel it failed miserably at this attempt. Some o.k. scenes, but that does not justify purchasing this video. Go ahead and rent it, but save that cash in your pocket on better horror movies."
positive,"Class Is DEFINATELY In Session!!: I liked Lauryn Hill so much in The Fugees, I had to get her first solo album. I was blown away after one listening! This album showcases her rap skills and wonderful singing vioce. Even the interludes between songs are bearable!! Of course ""Doo Wop (That Thing)"" is one of my favorites, where she shows off both of her talents. The harmonies are incredible!! Other faves include ""Ex-Factor"", ""I Used To Love Him"" (a duet with Mary J. Blige), and ""Final Hour"". The two I did not enjoy were ""Superstar"" and her duet with D'Angelo, ""Nothing Even Matters""(""NEM"" is just too long!!). This CD is a must for anyone who likes hip-hop, R&B, and/or (light) rap. Get your ""(Mis-)Education"" from Lauryn, and it will be tuition well-spent!"
positive,"An early example of modern graphics simulation in a film: I saw this when I was vacationing in Hawaii--a very good vacation movie. Very thin story line. I remember the ""waterworm"": that long, snaky blob of water that wandered through the rooms and made a face at you. The face was your own! Fun."
negative,"My daughter could get her arms out: I was very disappointed in this item. My daughter could easily pull her arms out, no matter how tightly we tried to close it. It didn't hold nearly as well as the Miracle Blanket. Although swaddling worked wonderfully for us, this product did not."
negative,"Great topic but brought down by the ranting: When Edward Abbey writes about the natural scenery of Utah it is splendid and a joy. When he moves on to his philosophy it is a struggle to stick through to the next page. The level of his hypocrisy is only matched by the level of his misanthropy. I could respect his opinions if he had quit work and moved to the desert, but he took a job for a capitalist government to tend the needs of the tourists, so all his rants about the same ring hollow. His ideas are what you would expect for a first year college student angry with society, not the deep thinker he takes himself to be. The number of glowing reviews really surprises me. I suspect many of them maybe didn't get passed the first couple chapters (which are great, great chapters). It's a wonderful topic but there are probably better sources out there."
negative,"What was RITA thinking?: I was so disappointed in this book. Since it was the 1998 RITA award as best regency, and beat ""Lord Heartless"" for that win, I was expecting a terrific novel. Instead, the book drags and the characters act in such an unrealistic ways. As far as the Duke goes, our hero, he has no family or friends. The heroine, and I use that term lightly, plays at being a spinster and dressing as a drab. For some reason, delights in hiding her beauty. In the ballroom scene, she behaves in such a manner that loses me entirely - as well as any interest that she should end up with the Duke in the end. He deserved better! The dukes only friend betrays him. He is a miserable man who society now scornes when he did nothing wrong in the first place! He should have packed his bags and came to america. I usually like Emma Jensen's books. There was nothing romantic about the book. Only a creepy feeling at the way society ended up treating the Duke."
negative,"Too many words: This is my least favorite book. I was forced to read it for freshman honors English, or I would have stopped reading it. It has a good plot, but because Dickens was paid by the word, he added too many useless details. I really didn't enjoy dinner scenes that lasted for 17,000 chapters without revealing anything remotely important. However, the way the characters intertwined was fascinating. If you want to get the interesting part of the book, read the cliff's notes. I've also heard it's a little less mind-numbing on tape. Only read the book if you're going to be quizzed on it the next day. I don't know if all Dickens is this bad, but I'll not read any more of his books until I'm forced to for my next English class."
positive,"as predictably good as hot chocolate after sledding: If you know nothing about a particular jazz CD but see Art Blakey on drums, you can bet it'll be a good one (you can say the same thing about Jimmy Cobb). This lineup features big names Freddie Hubbard and Wayne Shorter, and also well-regarded Curtis Fuller, Cedar Walton, and Jymie Merritt. The lineup's promising, and the songs are very solid. They seem pretty even to me, I don't want to name the best and worst songs, because my opinion is hardly set into stone. There are also bonus versions of four of the six songs. The original album at 40 minutes is a decent length. The thing that makes this a 4-star CD is that there aren't any GREAT songs, they're merely all good. If it had a song like ""The Egyptian"" or ""Moanin'"", it'd be a 5-star CD."
negative,"A wildly implausible thriller: This book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. I found all the other character two dimensional and all the ""intrigue"" regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence. Has Cornwell done better? I don't know and, after reading this, am in no big hurry to find out."
positive,"A classic that modeled the rest: After reading A Princess of Mars, I realized that it is the model for science-fiction/fantasy. The story is still fresh, and Burroughs captured the ideas of inventing alien or fantasy cultures. Some authors have taken the concept further (e.g. Flash Gordon, Star Wars) and others have made a mockery of the model (e.g. Chronicles of Gor). The sensuousness and adventure of this book cannot be denied. It is one of those stories that must be read, as no motion picture or other medium could quite do it justice."
negative,"Don't waste your $$$$: Would suggest this unless you are in an environment were dust/sand/etc is a major concern. It does cover the keys and for the most part fits, but the typing experience is horrible."
negative,a ripoff: Item is a DVD copy from another source...sound trails image by a few seconds THROUGHOUT....do NOT buy this DVD it is worthless
positive,"A Clockwork Orange: After reading several reviews of this wonderful flick I have concluded that the reviewers that disliked it are either unaware that is was a satire or don't know what a satire is. A satire is a "" An artistic work in which human voice or folly is attacked through irony, derision, or wit."" ( American Heritage Dictionary) Both this movie and the book were done as a satire of the humam race and government control. I will agree that the violence is graphic but that adds to the movie and tells its story better. This is most certainly not a movie meant for everyone. I would suggest that people read the book before they read the movie so they can understand what Anthony Burgess and Stanly Kubrick were trying to do."
positive,"Better than ""The Patriot"" anyhow...: Unlike ""the Patriot"", this movie at least kept me interested during it's epic length. While this movie is not good enough to add to my personal collection, I think it certainly earned 4 stars for pure entertainment value. This movie had one of the strongest cast of actors I have seen in quite some time. I also liked that it did not have a sugar-coated hollywood ending. The only annoying thing was that some of the action scenes seemed really ""choppy"", and were nearly impossible to see what was happening. This is a ""fun"" movie to watch, it has a little something for everyone."
negative,"Worst Ever?: I thought after the very weak effort on Bleachers he would bounce back with one of his best efforts. WRONG! Don't waste your money, reading this book is less exciting than listening to Nora Jones."
negative,"Wrong format - screen: Again, this movie is on the wrong format. Theback cover show widescreen, but not. Still it is 4:3.A great movie, but todays standards are not acceptable.Do not buy it, until ""another"" new edition will come with true 16:9."
positive,"Convenient Packaging for a Good Product: I'm a fan of DuPont Teflon Multi Use Lubricant and normally buy it in the 11oz. aerosol can. This squeeze bottle version allows application of small amounts more precisely, with less mess. Either way, DuPont has a great product that penetrates easily into most any area. It goes on water thin, dries quickly, and leaves a light, dry, waxy film fortified with Teflon. Though the bottle version is 4oz. it probably will last as long as the 11oz aerosol as there is much less waste.I started using this product to lube O-rings motorcycle chains, at which it excels, but quickly found it a preferred lubricant for most anything that one would want a lightweight lubricant. Much cleaner than any wet lube."
negative,"Update - Adapter broke!: I take back my previous comments as now this adapter is dead, and MUCH faster than my original one. I await Macally's response to my request for a new one."
positive,"A Frighteningly Real Masterpiece: This book was excellant and scary as hell when your reading it and realize that a lot of things that are in it are happening in our country today. Most people, myself included, who hear about this classic don't realize that there's a tragic love story wrapped inside of the haunting world of Orwell's 1984 that helps drive home the authors anti-utopian message. Also, the realism of the book seems almost three-dimensional casting a crystal clear picture of the nightmarish world of 1984 where Big Brother is always watching you- not just what you say or do but, what your thinking. Scarier than anything Stephen King ever wrote- and more realistic."
negative,"Made Me More Angry: Unfortunately, this book just made me more angry.This book might be okay for a person who subscribes to the religious views of the authors, but since I do not, I was annoyed at having been duped into buying a religious book under the guise of a psychology book, not to mention the bad advice inside it. I tried to get through it anyway, but after two valiant attempts (if I do say so myself) I decided I couldn't do it. I wish I could get my money back but unfortunately I wrote it in (as the book instructs) before I saw the religious stuff. Also, nowhere on the front does it say anything about religion, and only in tiny, tiny text above the barcode does it say it should be categorized as ""religious"" and the category ""psychology"" is absent."
positive,"Oh Mr Schultz, how I love thee: A Charlie Brown Christmas. Does this REALLY need a review. Who doesn't love CB?? Whaa whaa whaa whhhaaaaaa. So glad I finally purchased this."
positive,Good Concert: Always been a Cocker fan and this one will not disappoint. Given the age of this concert the sound and picture quality is OK...would rock in blue ray however!
positive,"Great, but ...: I'm on my third Keurig B60/B70 brewer. In my environment, they last about one year. That lifetime is not great. The good news is they are warranted for a year, so if it doesn't make it that long, they will replace it. Their customer service is friendly and knowledgeable. But, if yours lasts a little over a year, tough. Why am I on my third? Because they are that good. I hope I don't have to buy another in 13 months, but I probably would. If anyone else comes out with a K-cup brewer, I would be tempted to try it. I was OK with a Senseo, until I switched to k-cups. The only was to brew."
positive,very pleased: I read an article about over priced vaccuums as I was looking to purchase a unit. I was prepared to spend $500 for a unit. I found the hoover by accident. All the reviews were positive and I bought it. I have been very happy with this purchase. The suction and the attachments are great and easy.
negative,"This book is unintelligable.: I can not see why everyone thinks this book is so great. It reminds me of modern art, where a so called artist splashes paint on a canvas in ten minutes and then passes it off as a masterpiece. It probably took Joyce less time to write this novel than it took me to read it. If my grade hadn't depended on it, I would have put it down after ten minutes."
negative,"This single is bad: Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Deeper Underground (Chillington Mix) tries to have a more darker sort of industrial sound which sounds pretty mushy and terrible, as the vocals do not fit in one bit with the music.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
positive,Essential: This is an essential collection of Jennifer Warnes early work (pre-Famous Blue Raincoat) for enthusiasts. It allows the listener to hear the evolution in Ms. Warnes abilities although the purity of her voice was there from the beginning.
positive,"Great book.: Let me preface this review with the statement that I was supposed to have read this book years ago, when I was still an English Major and for some reason or not I never got to it. I now understand why it is considered a must read and classic. Its a great book with such insight to our culture that I now regret greatly not reading it sooner."
positive,"Great movie!: ""The Mummy Returns"" wasn't a great or horrible film, but the original ""The Mummy,"" was excellent. It had surprises and the mummy was the center of the film, unlike ""Returns."" It had more interesting dialogue. It was comical, and the acting was good, as were the special effects. It created an atmosphere of suspense. I highly recommend watching this creative and wonderful film."
positive,"Gripping!: After renting The Insider from the video store, I had to own this DVD. Strong performances by Pacino, and Christopher Plummer was fantastic as Wallace. And it carries a real good message. A lot F...'s which I don't and didn't particularly like, because for one thing I think it would be a great film to show teens to reinforce the notions of integrity. But, I know, ""realism"" and all that."
positive,"One of his Best: The audio version of this book made a 6 hour trans-Penn drive go very fast. Hillerman has a knack for weaving interesting characters, intricate plots, and Navajo mysticism into one cohesive package.""Hunting Badger"" recounts a multi-departmental manhunt for three cop-killer/thieves through the area surrounding the Four-Corners region. Our familiar heros are faced with the task of solving the crime despite of the best efforts of both the criminals and the FBI.My only criticism is that I would have liked more explanation of the motivations of the criminals, and more of an aftermath. This book lacked some of the action of some of the other books, but what it lacked in gunplay it made up in interesting deduction.Like his other works, it is a quick read and a good book on tape. And, being a reflection of an actual event, the plausibility factor increases the interest."
negative,"Buy Swaddlers or Cruisers Instead: I tried these diapers b/c my daughter's diaper was leaking at night, and these were the worst of all of the diapers I tried. They even leaked during the day.If you have nighttime diaper leaks, try going up a size and buying Pampers Swaddlers or Cruisers instead!Pampers Swaddlers, Size 2-3 (14-22 Lbs), Economy Plus Pack, 152 SwaddlersPampers Cruisers, Size 4 (22-37 Lbs), Economy Plus Pack, 140 Cruisers"
negative,"Worth the money! Once you get a working one!: Got a replacement, and new unit works GREAT! - Amazon won't let me change Stars, but I'd change to 4.5 if I could.!I purchased this after reading the reviews. I had no desire to use this for a party or large gathering, just one serving at a time ( 4-8 dogs). I tried it the day after it arrived and once since. The heating coils turn warm, but they don't warm up enough to prevent touching them after an hour on MAX heat. We tried two batches, after 1 hour the dogs were warm, more than room temp, but thats it. Called the company, they said to return to Amazon, we probably have a defective unit."
positive,"Great book for people concerned with healthcare mgmt: Although Robert Chalice does thoroughly identify major healthcare system problems, he balances this with a creative approach to addressing rising costs using a proven model from a totally unrelated industry. More than ever, the exploration and use of new ideas to address these issues becomes practical. This book is constructive in approach and the 38-step recipe for sheds light on area of improvement that have been perceived, but for some reason not implemented by many managers in this area. This book is nearly worth its weight in gold."
positive,very good book: I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for truth about this subject.the service was good also.thanks so much
positive,Loved it: Havent been able to find this album in years. Great buy! If you haven't heard it and like odd ball music with a flare of ronchyness this is it
positive,"great: love this diapers, they are so soft for babies and they fit very good and also the material is not hard for the babies' skin that for me is very important ."
negative,"the classic pulp novel is still selling fast: Bugliosi's ghost writer for this one crafted a skillful tale of the heroic prosecutor deciphering the real motive of the murders, despite the incompetence of the police department. You should know that practically everyone who studies the Manson case in detail regards this book as a work of fiction, the same way they regard Bugliosi's ridiculous made-up motive of ""trying to start a race war"". There is some info here that is hard to get elsewhere, but otherwise this is simply an attempt to sensationalize and make money. There are far better books you can read on the Manson case."
positive,"3 blades that shave your face... or whaterver.: The razor blades arrived only two days after I ordered them. The box and blades seemed a little bit cheaper than what I would buy in the store, but they work just fine. The cartridge fits onto my existing handle and provides a smooth shave. Seems like a good deal to me considering what they cost at the grocery store."
negative,I never even recieved the game: What a rip off i didnt even recieve the game i paid for to get for my brother for christmas!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative,"buggy from the start: From the very start I had problems with the CD. Before it would work, I had to download 2 patches. I emailed MW tech support, and by the end of the first week, had not received a reply. There are a number of features, meant to enhance, that actually work in reverse. I would have preferred a simple thesaurus addition, rather than a crossword puzzle solver. Buy the book instead!"
negative,"Far and away the most boring book in the series: I have every single Ring Of Fire book, and in general, the series is among my favorite sci-fi works. Except for this one. This book is not only almost unrelated to the rest of the series internally, it consists of a series of incredibly inane anecdotes about raising sheep and rabbits. Certainly the dullest sci-fi book I own. The ONLY reason to read this one is because it's referenced from later works, in particular 1635 - The Dreeson Incident. You'd think that a character in a sci-fi novel should have a story at least as interesting as a normal person in real life - and this book sure misses that goal. Unless you're really, really keen on reading short children's stories about anthropomorphic rams (the sheep kind), this book is sure to disappoint.Skip this one - you'll thank me later."
negative,"The book was so boring, but the movie was alright.: Well, I am reading this book in my english class at school, and it puts everybody to sleep! First of all, if Estella hit me like she did pip, I would have hit her back!! All the women in this book seem like stuck up b****es! Even the movie wasn't the best. I figured it would have made more sense than the book did, but I was wrong! You can barely understand what they say! Well, I just don't like the book, or the movie. I think they were both stupid, and neither of them make sense!!"
positive,"Appliance 20 amp timer: Great timer for dedicated appliance circuit. It has a high wattage rating for the large A/C's but does use the plug that has one prong sideways. The only thing i wish it had was more setting tabs so i could have more cycles, it comes with 2 sets of tabs."
positive,": ): I purchased two of these sleeping bags for Bonnaroo Music Festival 2007 and they worked out great - probably most suitable for cold weather, which the festival was not. For hot weather, I'd use a more breathable bag that isn't mummy shaped. But it kept me warm on the colder evenings and is very cushy."
negative,"What a jip!: When I got this set, I wanted to see ""The Year Without A Santa Claus,"" my favorite X-mas show. Someone at the plant must have put the wrong disc in the box. Instead of the 1974 version, there was a live action version with John Goodman. What a rip off! Can I get the actual one that is advertised on the box?"
positive,"AMAZING!: My brother bought this chair and I was a little skeptical. I have several of the very expensive put in your chair kinds, many large hand held and I have sat in the ones at the name brand places and not been impressed. Oh they felt okay, but didn't do the trick. When I went to my brother's house, he sat me down and I sat there the entire night! It was incredible. I have never felt anything so wonderfully relaxing other than my own massage therapist. This chair may seem expensive, but it's worth every drop. I am waiting for mine to be delivered!"
negative,"This ""glossary"" only has 100 words!: With thousands of related terms, this is very limited. Every time I've picked up the book to look up a term, it wasn't available. This is a waste!"
negative,"Wrong Bruce, you idiots!: Bruce BANNER turns into THE HULK, not THE BATMAN, morons! It's BRUCE WAYNE who turns into Batman. Maybe this toy would get better reviews if product specialists spent a LITTLE more time researching the list of who transforms into whom.Hulk SMASH stupid Batcave!"
negative,"A Waste: Rented this out after watching many other movies of the same genre. It turned out to be stupid, but almost unwatchable after the first 1/2 hr. Was expecting much more then this."
negative,A looser: I bought this and returned it. There must be someone out there with the right voice and reading skills to bring us Whitman's words and rhythms. Ms. Gibson's soprano sing-song doesn't make it.
negative,"WACK: This cd should be burned. any record from no limit should be, they can't rap at all. if you want real rap, listen to talib kweli, chino xl, big L, mos def, etc."
negative,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen...: Gymkata was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But, it was so cheesy and poorly done that it was hilarious! I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys finding humor in bad movies."
positive,Better than Perfume: Have only seen the play twice. I desperatly want this book. So quickly republish this book.
positive,"no leaking ...: Great, soft, secure diapers. My son [..]and I have been using Pampers FLEX for a long time. A few months ago I decided to try a cheaper brand for a change and sure enough, he leaked!!! UGH! Make sure you buy the FLEX DRY -- they are stretchie, soft and seemingly comfy for baby."
positive,pleased: Sometimes its hard to see a product online and really be sure itswhat you want. This time i was very pleased with the pan..its justwhat i wanted and it cleans up nicely.
negative,"What was Golding thinking?: Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature."
negative,"Prepare for Boredom and Pedantry: I must confess, I did not like the hobbit until I heard it dramatized, and then only somewhat. The tone of the book treats the reader like he/she is a child, the story is amateurish, although I am told it is symbolic. For real fantasy, this is not it."
positive,"Bilbo Baggenses: (paraphrased) You dont believe the propheses because you had a hand in making them? You don't believe this all happened by luck, do you? After all you are just a little fellow in a wide world."
negative,"Where's The Carribean Soul?: Being Puerto Rican, I love to dance the Salsa, meringue, and music that just makes you swing. This latest from my most favorite diva is misleading. The cover of the CD shows her getting it down and dancing. Well, when I popped this cd in I couldn't dance to a single one.Don't let the other reviews here fool you. If you like a lot of s-l-o-w, and I mean s-l-o-w ballads, then hey, I highly recommend this CD. If you're expecting real latin music, than the best picks are Abriendo Puertas (my favorite, because you can dance to all of the tracks) and Mi Terra (Just LOVE Mi Terra!). Gloria is my favorite singer of all time, and I worship her and all, but Gloria, honey, you really let me down on this one."
positive,"men in white coats: Whatever you do, do not read this book in public; you could get taken away by two men in white coats who did not realize the fit you are having is just uncontollable laughter."
positive,"""Treasure Island"" for little boys: This classic went to a 7-year old boy. It is sadly not taught in many schools these days. He loved the book, of course, and I was delighted to see this classic live another generation."
positive,"A sorely underrated gem of a platformer for Gamecube: Vexx is the type of game that you can not fully appreciate until you get into some of the later levels. I for one think this games' graphics are great, especially through progressive scan. Awesome character designs and very unique textures. Where this game really shines are the awesome, huge worlds you traverse through. I found myself not being able to wait to see what new world i was going to unlock. Each level has 8-10 goals that you can tackle in any order, making it an extremely non-linear game. One area that this game really shines in is the PUZZLE DESIGN! Some of the puzzles in these levels are INGENIOUS! This game is truly for hardcore platforming fans only, if you can't handle your analog stick to perform precise jumping, crawling or maneuvering, you need to stick to your first person shooters."
negative,"iPAQ 3630 Useless with NT: Like those who wrote before me, I too, use an NT laptop at work and while I am able to sync at home via the supplied USB cradle, all my really useful and important stuff is on the NT powered laptop! I have been everywhere (including several other cities across the country) and done everything I could think to do to try to find the serial cradle but to no avail. This seems to be a terrific product but unfortunately, it is nothing more than a expensive doorstop until I can get a serial cradle and sync with my data."
positive,"sent this to my sister as well: i sent it to my sister so i couldn't tell ya, she seemed to be pleased though"
positive,"Impressed: I must say that this album kicks butt. Not only am i impressed by the lyrics and beats, which astounded me even more on how fluent these girls are at english and russion, but the fact that these girls dont give a $hit about what other people think. One thing that puzzled me though was why Japans album got bonus tracks, but not europes or the US one."
negative,"not what I expected: I bought this product to repair the rand on my hiking boot. It went on easily, but after it dried, it peeled right off the leather part of the boot,and I was able to peel it off the rest. The product was also shiny, very unlike the original rand. I followed the directions for cleaning the boot prior to application."
positive,"You can tell this is a work of love! Clay ""Shines"": I have been anticipating this CD for quite some time and have to say it is even more than I had hoped for. It is an absolutely fabulous work by one of the most talented entertainers I have ever heard. I think there is something for everyone here. Clay's beautiful voice in ballads, ""Measure of a Man"" is so heartfelt. There are some great up-tempo songs, ""Invisible"" and one of the best surprises for me ""Touch"". I found myself dancing without even knowing when this song came on. Can't stop listening to Clay's debut efforts. Looking forward to following this exceptional artist and person for many years!"
negative,"Pathological Liar Cons Publisher and Self: As a person close to much of that described in the book, I can say that Joe Jett is completely deluded. Additionally, it stuns me that such a poorly written fantasy has been promoted heavily let alone published at all. Were it not for the comic value that exists for me as someone who knows much of the reality re. all of this, I would not have graced this piece of trash with more than a very few moments of my time."
positive,"Oracle 8i Networking 101: If you are new to Oralce and want somewhere to start, you will find this book very usefull. I had to set up a new (small scale) Oracle DB (including Oracle Express and OSA)on an NT platform.I have spent the past 5 years in the IT industry so wanted a book that was technical enought to keep me interested but not too advanced that it goes over my head. With the help of this book I was able to set up my servers and get them all ""talking"" to each other. Well worth the money....."
negative,Order from Amazon: Make sure you order this magazine from Amazon(.com). I ordered from the publisher and have had nothing but problems. It's been a month since I ordered it and still no magazine. I have e-mailed them several times but have not gotten the answers I asked for or found out where my subscription is. As a result I would recommend going with a magazine from another publisher.
positive,"Stephani: This book kept me involved in the story from the first chapter to the last page and wanting more! I couldn't wait to get out and read the next book, and the next! Hopefully they won't keep us waiting for book 4 for too long!"
negative,"Simply aweful: The storyline is well constructed, but the audio acting is terrible --- makes an adult cringe. For the musically challenged, the singing can be tolerable otherwise prepare for projectile vomiting. My younger children love the movie, but the older ones ""loathe"" (my 10-year-old daughter's word) it. I really wish they would redo this story with actors that have talent."
negative,"Lack of Sensitivity: Some funny talk, yes. But this movie is the opposite of sensitivity, to say it politely. The film of cause has a bigger concept. If you want to be surprised, stop reading right now. Two strangers meet by looking at the same vacant apartment in Paris. Skipping the romance, he suddenly decides to get physical with her, and she goes along. At this point, I should have stopped the movie, which went downhill until the end, which was the most disturbing scene. All in all, one might ask the question if the fact that two famous actors are the lead characters, can justify the so-called critics praising this movie. They might have both done it only for the money, being ashamed for it later on. Let's hope so."
positive,"Best of the Series: Many people do not know that this is only part of a 60 volume serial.The main reason most people are confused about what is happening is a lack of understanding about internal energy or ""Chi"". This is the magic of the Orient. Many various legends of certain types of ""secret"" Kung Fu have existed for centuries in China and the chinese audinces are not so confused by the plot line.If you suspend you dis-belief this is a fantastic, fuuny, deadly serious, bloody tale of sweat revenge; betrayal and ultimate victory for the underdog. I can't find a better movie that works on all these levels.The english sub-titles are washed out by the background in some frames but can be gleaned if the movie is watched enough which you are sure to do."
negative,"Boring: Half-vampire Darren Shan, Mr. Crepsley and three of Mr. Tiny's Little People leave the Cirque Du Freak. They journey to the Vampire Mountain. Gavner Paul, a friend Mr. Crepsley also travels with them. One of the little people reveals his real name as, Harkat Mulds, and he has a message to deliver from Mr. Tiny to the Vampire Princes.Many dangers confront them on their way. The purple-skinned Vampaneze are close by.The Vampire Mountain is a network of tunnels and caves where the vampires live. Darren makes friends with several of the other vampires.The Princes and Generals weren't impressed with Darren. They thought he was too young. Now Darren must prove himself to them.I found the fourth book in the series to be boring and not enough action."
negative,"skimmed to the end: This reminded me of a Nancy Drew story in which Nancy gets laid, more than once. If this seems vulgar, then prepare yourself for a big surprise if you read this book. Contrived ""in the nick of time"" encounters hobble the already weak suspense, and stereotypes abound. You'll be happier with some James Lee Burke."
negative,"This toy is the WORST!: This toy is the worst! You can't even get past the Password screen to play anything. I got tricked that it was a good toy, but it's not. And I don't want you to get tricked, either. I thought it was a good toy by looking at it in the wrapper, but it wasn't."
positive,"Kubrick and the aethesticization of violence: Another milestone in cinematic history, the dark, disturbing, iconclastic, humorous, Swiftian/Kubrickian view of society, freedom, and the Jungian shadow. As always, a stunning portrait of human nature. Kubrick at once repulses and makes accomplices of the audience. Do we acknowledge our own shadows? McDowell is compelling as the ""prime misfit"" of a degenerate rapidly approaching facist society. True, Alex is dangerous and terrifying, but he is also, for a time, free, and certainly more human than many of the other characters. If anyone should doubt that a government would employ the ""Ludivico"" technique, have you heard of the ""chemical castration"" administered to rapists? At any rate, a disturbing film well worth watching and contemplating."
positive,"Episode List: In the second half of Season Six we continue to slip away from the early film noir feeling of this series, and more into a sixties flavor. The acting and writing are not at their peak. But Perry Mason is a great show no matter what. Here are the episodes:1. The Case of the Prankish Professor2. The Case of Constant Doyle - Bette Davis filling in for an absent Raymond Burr (who makes a short appearance on the phone, in his bathrobe)3. The Case of the Libelous Locked - Michael Rennie filling in for Raymond Burr4. The Case of the Two-Faces Turn-a-bout - Hugh O'Brien filling in5. The Case of the Surplus Suitor - Walter Pidgeon filling in6. The Case of the Golden Oranges - Perry is back!7. The Case of the Lawful Lazarus8. The Case of the Velvet Claws9. The Case of the Lover's Leap10. The Case of the Elusive Element11. The Case of the Greek Goddess12. The Case of the Skeleton's Closet13. The Case of the Potted Planter14. The Case of the Witless Witness"
positive,Insightful: Thought this book was excellent. She has taken the time to practice some of the things that others are doing even though its not her lifestyle and she has found it to be of benefit to her.
negative,Just not the same Clay: I had to turn the bass all the way down and turn the treble all the way up just to find a glimpse of Clay's voice. This album just has too much clutter for a great voice like his. I guess I will just have to wait until the corporate excutives get out of the way for Clay to find his voice again. They must have thought that the music was more important than his voice.Can I get my ten bucks back?
negative,"Looks are deceiving: I purchased this Ironing Board Hanger cause I have a 'Y' shaped board like the one in the picture. When you hand the board on it, the hanger twists a little thus not hanging flat against the closet door. Also, the whole contraption hangs too high up so the door won't even close when the actual iron is on it."
negative,"Should have stopped after the 2nd: Very disapointing sequel not up to the same quality as the first two. Tried to turn it into an action adventure. Anne is no longer cute, charming, and talkative but haggard, dull and quiet. The entire movie was depressing and unrealistic. I wish I never saw it; it spoiled my memory of the first two."
negative,"Mr coffee let me down: I bought this coffee pot for my mom for Christmas because she has one just like it from the 80's but it looks awful, this is the 2nd mr coffee 4 cup pot that I bought for her and they both don't heat water hot enough to brew the coffee, the coffee always turns out weak tasting, she tried using a dark roast and still no flavor, never will I buy me coffee again"
positive,"Even better than 98 if thats possible: Let me start off by saying that if you are an F1 fan especially a technical one(like myself) you can't pass up this book. If you do not know who Giorgio Piola is, he draws for the weekly magazine AutoSport. He is one of the best artist I have seen. His technical drawings allow you to understand the F1 cars in a technical perspective. Compared to the last edition ""Technical Analysis 98"", this one is even better. If you don't have the 98 book you should order that one too. I do like the 99 book since it is written in english only as opposed to the 98 which is in italian and english, but thats not a problem. What will really impress you is the attention to detail of the drawings, but they are so easy to understand. Again this is a must for any F1 fan. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
negative,"Poor Packaging/No Warranty: I purchased another MK315 because I smoked the first one during an electrical storm. I received my Minn Kota MK315 and the first thing I noticed was the poor packaging from AMAZON.com. As heavy as that unit is, they tossed it in a box with a couple of piece of bubble wrap which allowed the unit to beat the outside box and unit box to pieces. Since it was left on my doorstep, wasn't much I could do. Upon installation, the ""Power"" light did not work. Unit seems to charge all three batteries fine. Minn Kota says there is no warranty because I cut the power cord to install in the boat. In their words; ""The MK-315 is a reliable charger. It is unlikely that the charger was defective right out of the box. Unfortunately because the AC plug was altered the warranty is now void. The chargers are a sealed unit and cannot be repaired."" I do believe that will be the last Minn Kota charger I buy!"
negative,"There's nothing new in here: If you're new to weight training, this might be good for you because there's a lot of description and pictures. If you're a little more advanced, you might want to pass - there's nothing new in here, and some of the suggestions are a little old school for me."
negative,"Great Saw At First But Don't Use Too Often: I Bought this saw about a year ago and thought it was wonderful. Everything on it worked great. A couple of months later the handle to tighten the miter adjustment stripped out. I ordered replacement parts from Makita and received them in a very timely fasion. Shortly after that it stripped again so I made my own replacement parts that work much better. Unfortunately other cheap plastic parts on it are starting to fail and fall apart. I am a big believer in Makita tools and own many for my contracting business, but I strongly suggest buying a different saw. The best part on the saw is the folding stand which I now use to hold my old De Walt rack and pinion table saw."
positive,"Interesting parallels to Angela's Ashes: I thought that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was similar in so many ways to Angela's Ashes. I enjoyed comparing them as I read. Mainly, I thought that A Tree Grows in Brooklyn had a more hopeful spin than Angela's Ashes, but that Frank McCourt was more poetic in his writing than Betty Smith. If you have read one of these two books, I definitely recommend reading the other, too. It makes for a really interesting comparitive read!"
positive,Catspaw: I thought this was the most accurately thought out science fiction novel I had ever read. It showed the dark side of the future that so many other novels tend to 'cure' with out losing the beauty of the charactors. This was the first novel I had read in this trilogy and it stands alone as it should.
negative,"I wish they sold the old version.: I bought the imaginext castle because my chidren (I own a daycare in my home) wanted a castle. Well I went to get the fisher price one and this is what they gave me. I hated it the minute I opened the box. I cant believe they made something that has NO durabilty at all. The poor kids cant even put a knight on it without some side or piece falling off. I have put this thing together more times in the month I have had it! would however recommend the orginal castle that does not fall apart, maybe I just dont get the concept of putting the castle they way you want it if its just going to fall apart."
negative,"DUMBEST BOOK EVER!!!!: You always here of classics being read by generation after generation, this isn't one of those. It should be burned itself. I can't believe i read this dumb book"
positive,"excellent, well written and ver realistic: i thought it described well the possibilties of the power of the govbernment if we the people do notstnad up against the oppression the are providing."
negative,"I don't recommend this book.: This Book tells a story about two friends who are looking for a new job near the Salinas River in California. Lenny, who is mentally retarded, and George, the smart one. They had to escape from their last job because Lenny got in trouble. In the new job the story will be repeated, but this time for the last time. The only reason I gave this book a star is because is has a good plot, and because this is happening in the world right now, it is a reality. The main factor that called my attention was the vocabulary and quotations of the characters. This is why I give one star to the book."
negative,Not as good as I had hoped: It sounds somewhat incomplete and boring to me to listen similar kind of tunes through out the whole thing. Still better than figure head type musician but not as good as I hoped. Felt this is the limit of her or the producer so I don't plan to buy next album if same producer.
positive,Sleep Saver: I bought this because my eight week old son would wake up and cry right after I put him in his bassinet. He loves this. We have been using it for three weeks and we love it. There are no longer any sleepless nights. With this he falls back to sleep quickly after night time feedings.
positive,"The Family Under The Bridge: Once there was an old hobo named. The hobo lived under a bridge in Paris,France. One day the hobo went to the brige and he found three children and their dog. Then the hobo left the bridge. When he was leaving he saw the children cring.They wanted him to stay.He left but,soon came back.He realize thathe loved the children.Then the hobo got a job and a home for his family. The End... I give this book 5 stars. I really enjoyed this book. I recommend this book to be read to young children. The End..."
positive,I don't want to give it a dam title: a great and cheap option to protect the expensive lense of your camera from scratches
negative,"This movie was a huge let-down: I think I only really dislike it because of how little it connects to the previous films (which are amazing). I think this one tries too hard to be an adventure movie and completely loses sight of the sentiment of the story written by Montgomery. Otherwise, it was mildly entertaining."
positive,"Business Management: I really like this book, the way it is set up, the way it looks, and the way it is presented. The most useful part of the book was at the end of the chapters was a through chapter test. If every book I had was set up this way I think I would do very well in my classes. Each chapter was well explained and the illustrations and graphics were very good and learning oriented."
positive,"Egads...They're Teenagers!!!: Is it me or is it kind of fascinating watching the characters grow older? (Who knew that Neville Longbottom would be sooo tall?!)Anyhow, the film, I thought overall it was a very good film. Other's have pointed out that it does not follow form to the book, however, as one who has never read one of the books, the film alone is very entertaining. Something had to be left out or this film would have probably passed the four hour mark.As usual, great visual effects. I loved the entry of the two rival schools. Sorry, I now know that they aren't private schools for boys or girls, but it was very entertaining the way it was presented...and isn't that the final point?It was also interesting how the characters have grown up and are recognizing their hormones. OMG I felt really, REALLY, uncomfortable when Harry and Ron were sitting with their ""dates"" at the ball.So would I recommend this film?...sure...I'd even buy it..."
negative,"Promising topic, but....: ...doesn't deliver on the substance. This book was very disappointing in its very superficial treatment of the topic."
negative,"Surrender this one: After plodding through a few chapters of these boring characters, I surrendered the book to the stack waiting to go back to the library."
positive,"A must read: Even if one doesn't accept the concept and theory one should read this. It is an easier read than you might think, and the abridged version that this book doesn't take long to get through. It will leave one with a great understanding of what has been the most argued theory of the last century, and which continues to be argued even today."
negative,"Go to Broadway, please!!!: While Clay Aiken does have an amazing talent for singing, he's album better suites middle-aged America instead of a younger, more ""poppy"" audience. I get irritated seeing people compare Ruben and Clay. They are in two totally different genres!"
positive,"The Pinnacle of Modal Jazz: John Coltrane is at his best on this recording. Some people dislike it because they believe it is excessively serious, but to me it is deeply emotional and even joyful. It really takes an open mind (and concentration) to enjoy this CD properly, but it will more than reward the listener for the energy he expends.Musically, it would be absurd to attack this recording; the writing, improvisation, and interaction are flawless.One word of warning: If you are someone who listens to music for simple entertainment or background, this is not the CD for you. Listening to this CD in the background would be like reading yourself to sleep with James Joyce's ""Ulysses"".It really boils down to how you see music. Some people just don't think of music as being a deeply expressive artistic outlet, and that's fine - but they won't enjoy this CD."
positive,"Can you handle the truth?: Still's book, ""New World Order : The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies"" is a GREAT history book for high school students. Advanced home school courses ought to be based on it. I'd suggest it for each advanced private and home-school senior.Excellent research, writing and organization. Highest recommendation."
positive,"Classic: Always wonderful to read a classic!I never tire if reading this book, movies are great, book is always better."
negative,"REGION WARNING: I didn't know DVDs have a region requirement and the seller apparently knows this. I live in Wisconsin but got a DVD that is playable in EUROPE. MY BAD!! According to seller, my options are to buy a more encompassing DVD player or pay the shipping back to Mars and the additoinal shipping for the exchange. If you are buying from this seller make sure to READ THE FINE PRINT before finalizing the purchase."
positive,"What Campbell/Webb Fans Have Been Waiting For: Finally, the long awaited CD that all of us Glen Campbell/Jimmy Webb fans have been waiting for! This CD includes Glen's best album from the 70s, ""Reunion"", along with virturally all of his covers of Webb's later songs. A must have CD!"
positive,"DIFFERENT BUT ASTOUNDING!!: While the song selection doesn't allow much room for Clay's awesome glory notes, his amazing voice shines through loud and clear! This album is definitely POP and will forever dispell the Broadway comments often hurled in his direction! Every song on this CD will pull you in...there are no losers here!"
negative,"The worst kind of pop music.: This is the kind of song that really hurts legit pop acts. The song is more or less catchy and well written, but the ""artist"" is terrible. Hoku can not sing any better than most people I know.He voice is very weak in the first place- she has a limited range that is very evident during the high parts, and when you add to that the fact that her voice just SOUNDS unappealing, well, the song is a recipe for disaster.But I am sure it will get lots of play, which is unfortunate since people like Christina Aguilera and Mariah Carey at least have vocal talent, and probably the same songwriters."
positive,"An Awesome Ministry: I enjoy your music so much and every last one of your songs touch my heart. As a teenager I consider you a positive appearance and influence to all the other young people that they can be used of God and that they can stay saved. Be Blessed and keep looking up because your help cometh from the Lord and if you acknowledge God in all you do he will direct your path and give you the desires of your heart. God Bless You, take care, and continue to let God use you!"
positive,"Works Well!: I bought this item for my wedding dress! I wanted to make sure that I ""tried out"" the cincher before my big day and it works really well! I started out with this same item, in a Small - but it gave me ""back fat"" which I do not normally have...I returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm. When wearing the cincher you have two ""size options"" with the double hook closure..which allows you to let it out more around the bust & tighter around your ""natural"" waist to create a better shape. It definately does the trick and is made of rubber material(def makes you sweaty...but it DOESNT move around) Totally worth it!Kinda painful...the boning pushes into my ""under/side boob"" probably because I am not super skinny immediately under my boobs...(size 36 DD)Ladies, if it helps..I am 5'2 135lbs busty, not super skinny but not fat(size 27 in jeans)"
positive,"i'm so proud to know Gunnar Hansen is icelandic!: YES! finally i see this film on DVD... oh man, what a movie! i wish i had seen it in the cinema back in '74 though, but still the first time i saw it was on super8(8mm) in the old days... intense is the word for this movie, the soundtrack totally freaks you out, what a brilliant soundtrack... Gunnar Hansen(leatherface)which is from Iceland became a worldwide horror movie cult legend for this movie... and for me being from Iceland makes this one highly recommended! forget björk this is a true icelandic hero!"
negative,"Tedious Reds under the beds stuff: Mr Drury's earlier novels are well received (Advise and Consent, particularly). I won't be bothering to read any more after this rather tedious 'The Russian's are coming to get us' effort. We all know now how that turned out. I will say that is slightly more believable than 'Red Dawn', slightly."
positive,Gold Toe is the Gold Standard: Love these socks from Gold Toe. They last and they are well made. Most of my socks are Gold Toe.
positive,"a Stunning masterpiece of Animation!!!: The Story deals with a Evil Planet named "" Unicron"" ( Orson Wells) who plans on destroying Cybertron, and it's up to Ultra Magnus ( Robert Stack) and his fellow Autobots to kick his huge mechanical Butt. Amazing, Dazzeling, entertaining and action packed that will give you "" The Animated ride of your life"" on the screen, will satisify your taste for action. It's got everything including a groovy soundtrack, a Must own for Anime fans.A Animation Classic alongside Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll, Fist of the North Star, Heavy Metal, Rock and Rule, American Pop, The Professional: Golgo 13, The Hobbit, Robin Hood, Mulan, Hercules, Toy Story, The Last Unicorn, and so many other masterpieces of animation."
positive,"whatever: Their first album was better. This a good CD, but it lacks the complete insanity of the first one (Sugar, Ddevil, Darts...). The band is starting to head in a more mainstream direction. This CD is good, but I'm worried that they will become progressively more poppish with each album.There are alot of songs on Toxicity, such as Science, that succeed only because of one small section. Science would be a pretty boring song if it weren't for that awesome eastern sounding bit. The songs on the first album didn't need to be patched up to sound cool; they were brilliant to start with.If you don't have the first CD and want to buy Toxicity, do yourself a favor and get the first one instead. Only buy this if, like me, you really like the first one and want more."
positive,"Works much better than expected: I purchased this for my new Series 3 TiVo and couldn't be happier. I do a lot of video transfers from my computer to my TiVo using Vuze, and I am able to begin watching a show as soon as a transfer has been initiated; the transfers have also been error-free.I was concerned about the adapter's ability to connect with my computer, as my laptop computer often has issues getting a strong signal in the room where the TiVo is located, but it doesn't seem to be the case.The price on Amazon was considerably lower than I found anywhere else, especially when combined with the free shipping offer.Overall, I can't recommend this highly enough!"
negative,"Dull: After reading about Ambrose Bierce and his fierce wit this book was a real let down. Too many stories, all of a similar vein. I should have gotten the Devil's Dictionary!!!"
positive,"Good stuff: If you've ever played this game before, then you know what to expect. So to you folks, it's just what you think it's going to be like! For those who have never played Rampart it goes a little like this: Build city walls around castles to stay alive and gain more points. Then place cannons. Then prepare for a frenzied round of battle! After the round, you do it all over again! I'm not sure when or how you win, but you just do. Even though it sounds simple, it's quite entertaining. I cannot play for more than a half hour or so at a time because it just gets too difficult. When it says GAME OVER, you just feel like you need a break. That, however, doesn't stop me from playing again later. Overall, the simple tetris like strategy for adults and blow em up to bits action for the kids make this a game everyone can enjoy."
negative,Not recommended on iPhone: Its a classic literature. Just try not to read this on an iPhone. You'll get bored pretty soon and this book won't get the attention that it truly deserves.
negative,"Something was bugging me about this CD.: I couldn't figure out what. But then it came to me. She is copying Bob Marley. I see it clearly now: the lyrics, music, even the hair style. Then I realized she named a son zion. The sentiments of the Rastafarian people of Jamaica copied down to the ""T"". Maybe she can fool middle America, but the people who listen to ""World Music"" know better. We've been exposed to this music years before. I gave her 2 stars for re-packaging and marketing the music to the general public of America who maybe haven't heard ""world music"" before."
negative,"DVD BOOT HILL: WE WERE DISAPPOINTED IN THE MOVIE, IT WAS MORE LIKE A CLASS D FILM AND NOT VERY INTERESTING AS A WESTERN.MAYBE FOR CHILDREN??"
positive,"gunfighter ballads & trail songs: I, like a lot of others in Arizona, was raised on this album when it first came out in the 60's. Bought the tapes, both 4 then 8 track then the cd. This is pure Marty Robbins, and what took him from Grand avenue honky tonks in Phoenix, glendale and peoria Arizona to the big time. However Marty Robbins did not write El Paso. It was written by Elizabeth Garrett, Sherriff Pat Garretts' blind daughter. That information used to be on the early recordings of it."
positive,"Challenging and confusing at times, but a definite Must Read: This book contained many characters and was easily confusing, but every moment I spent reading this was way worth the while. I read this book from 2:30 in the morning to just after four. I could have watched TV, one of my favorite hobbies, but I chose to read, instead!"
negative,"Julia: I had great hopes for this film, it was after all an Oscar winner, but I now understand why the film was not widely available. I found it disjointed. There seemed to be a lot of time spent shouting down the telephone and smoking cigaretes which would be fine if the conclusion satisfied me, it didn't.The main Character, played by Jane Fonda, seemed naive and hopeless, the title character, played by Vanessa Redgrave was such an enigma that she was unbelievable in substance and played far to minor a role in the film. The only reason that I would like to know what happened next is simply to find out if any strength of resolve would be found! I think probably not."
negative,"Mowat Cried Wolf: This book is PURE FICTION.I encourage Amazon to file this book under ""Comedy"" if not ""Fiction"". Putting it under an ""Ecological Essay"" is adding insult to injury. There is nothing ""ecological"" about this book, nor is this book an essay. This is the same man that thinks pissing in front of a predator will keep them at bay. I dare anyone to try that. Nevermind, don't, because I don't want to be tracked down for punitive damages after the person dies."
negative,"take note!: This ""BABY"" comes complete with thong underwear (which you would never know from the package). I was very embarrassed for requesting this ""baby doll"" for my 5 year old's birthday. The adults at the party passed around the doll checking out the underwear. I got a lot of raised eyebrows and ""you've got to be kidding""s. Nothing really phases me but I think that is absolutely ridiculous."
positive,"Perfect for what I need: This keeps my coffee hot until I am done in the morning. I turn it on, go make coffee in the break room at work, set my mug down, and my coffee stays hot all morning."
positive,"A must-have!: I have All-clad, cast iron, you name it. But now, with just the two of us, this is my ""go to"" pan for everything from oatmeal to soup to veggies. Love it and highly recommend. Good even heating and easy clean up in the dishwasher."
positive,"Bowie and Ronson - nothing more need be said!: I have to chuckle at the perfectionists that diss this DVD because of the video quality. Folks, it was filmed in 1973! Nothing was as technically good then as it is now. And the style of filming IS dated, I agree. But take this for what it is - the ONLY film document of one of the major moments in rock history - Bowie performing with the original Spiders From Mars as his gender-bending Ziggy Stardust persona. Add the fact that it is maybe the only recorded document of Mick Ronson live, and what more could you want?! (OK, I'm a guitarist, and Ronson is one of my guitar heroes, and so I guess I am biased). But really - what an incredible performance! Bowie and Ronson - it just doesn't get much better than that..."
negative,"Grossly Overrated: After the title I am with those that find the characters, story, ending, everything about this book without any interest. Personally I'm unable to fathom the good reviews this relatively boring book gets."
positive,"It's Abridged?: Men at Arms, the second A-M Night Watch book, is most likely the best Watch book of all. Corporal (now Captain) Carrot is the catalyst of the change in the Watch, hiring 3 new members. Lance-Constables Angua, Cuddy, and Detritus (the former splatter of the Mended Drum). With the ongoing gangfights with the dwarves and trolls, Detritus and Cuddy put aside their differences and, with the help of Carrot, recruit more members to solve the mystery of Discworld's first -and only- ""gonne""."
positive,"LIFE CHANGINGING BOOK: THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE ( WORK,RELATIONSHIPS AT HOME,FRIENDS),IF YOU UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE THE SKILLS DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK.IT CHANGED MY LIFE.MANY THANKS TO THE AUTHORS."
negative,"Ulysses, Jame Joyce: The book came promptly, but the condition was not ""very good""as described. It also is paged differently from other Ulysses books used in my course. This makes it difficult to find sections that the class is discussing."
positive,"4.5 = 5 stars: A great, historic concert, which became a great video, and a great double album, which became.....the CD we discuss right here. The concert was a sensational success, most notably for bringing back the first draft Hall of Famers with a Top 200 placement..followed by two more charting albums!.With an intercontinnetal contingent led by Dave Edmunds, you know there are gonna be no spaced out tributes to their imitators.The ""Complete"" package includes many previously unreleased ""old-timey"" Country Folk numbers: just Phil & Don vocals and guitars. These wonderful mountain chants, we can fully appreciate their unparralelled two-part harmony - the full band and Don are mixed well, but Phil is more of a background singervthan a harmonist on the classics like ""Walk Right Back"" and ""When Will I Be Loved?"".The novice can also enjoy hearing, in full swing, the act that influenced groups like America, the Beatles, the Byrds...now moving on to the ""C""s......."
negative,"Great Cup of Coffee!: I am editing this review - I really liked these coffee makers - they just don't last. I've had two and both have died within a year. I wouldn't purchase again.I purchased this brewer after having the B60 at my office. This brewer makes a fabulous cup of coffee, in silence. If you're researching on whether to buy the B60 or B70 .. spring for the $30 more in price. The B60 is very loud and the B70 is nice and quiet.It's just such a pleasure to be able to accommodate everyone's individual tastes of flavored coffee, tea, hot chocolate, a mild blend or a bold blend without having to brew a separate pot of coffee or have tea kettles. This brewer even has an iced drink setting. I haven't tried it yet, but I think it's going to be awesome this summer.There are many, many different K-Cups to try. It's difficult to choose so you need to keep a list of what you like from the samples they send you with the brewer.Happy brewing!"
negative,damaged: the product was delivered badly damaged. in contacting the issuing company they had no correspondance with their delivery company and therefore had no idea when the new table was being delivered and when the damaged table was being picked up. Multiple emails and phone calls did not help the situation as the delivery company continued to attempt delivery on days that we were not notified and did not notify the issuing company. The final decision was to cancel the order ( a month later) and we do not have a table. Restockit seems fine..however their ability to communicate with their delivery service is subpar. Because of the lack of correspondance between the delivery company and restockit the only time restockit called or emailed us was when we initiated the correspondance. After a final telephone/email conversation restockit submitted an immediate credit to my credit card. unfortunately due to their shipping company i would not do buisness with them again.
negative,"Too Wordy!: I was assigned this book through my 10th grade English course. Never before have I been forced to struggle through a book like this one. Conrad's style is adds superfluous information that does absolutely nothing to advance the plot or symbolic significance of the story. The sentences and paragraphs were too large to be dealt with rationally. One of the chapters, which is about 4 and a half pages, is one single paragraph! While the story itself was a good one, Joseph Conrad ruins it with his esoteric and over-descriptive style of novel-writing."
positive,"good: Good cheap sleeping bag. Used in 50 degree weather, and was not overly warm. I kind of doubt the 30 degree rating, but a fine bag. Comfy lining, no sweating."
positive,"The best book on Struts I've seen: A friend recommended this book to me. I had already bought another book, but felt it had many gaps. I borrowed Struts in Action, read a couple of chapters, and was very impressed. The examples are great - nice and simple to start out with - and the Struts Framework is covered clearly and in detail. I've ordered my own copy, and I showed the book to a co-worker who then bought one too. All in all a great book."
positive,"THE BEST: THERE ARE NO REAL WORDS THAT REALLY FIT THIS YOUNG MAN. HE IS WHAT I HOPE MY THREE SONS WILL ONE DAY BECOME. ""GREAT"" NOT ONLY FOR THE GOD GIVEN VOICE BUT FOR THE PERSON THAT HE IS. I JUST HOPE HE WILL STAY THAT WAY. SOME PEOPLE WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS REVIEW BUT ABOUT 10 MILLION WHO HAVE WATCHED THIS BOY BECOME A MAN RIGHT BEFORE OR EYES WILL. THIS ALBUM HAS BOUGHT SO MANY PEOPLE BACK TO THE RECORD STORES BECOUSE CLAY KNOWS THAT THEIR ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO INJOY MUSIC WITHOUT HAVING TO LISTEN TO THE JUNK THAT IS PUT OUT TODAY AND SHAPE OUR CHILDRENS MINDS. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WILL PUT THIS CD DOWN JUST THINK ONE DAY YOU WILL BE THE PARENT.THANK YOU CLAY FOR BEING YOU. YOU HAVE NOT ONLY TOUCHED MY LIFE BUT YOU HAVE CHANGE THE WAY MY BOYS NOW FEEL ABOUT WHO THEY COULD BE."
positive,"Electrifying!: This cd should bring The Tommy Castro Band all the recognition they deserve. This band is the future of Blues. My personal favorites are ""Like an angel"", ""Chairman of the board"" and ""Just a Man"". Tommys crisp guitar and vocals on ""right as rain"" are outstanding"
negative,I have not recieve it yet: I have not recieve it yet.It have been 30 days and i have not recieve it yet.I dont know what to do
negative,"My disappointment with the purchase.: When I purchased this workbook, I expected it to be the same version as the one sold by the City College of San Francisco. But it is not. Because the complete workbook must consists of two parts: the written part and the conversation part. But the version sold by Amazon consists of only the written part which is not required by the teacher. So when I made a complaint to you, you sent me the same version again. This is a waste of time and money. I dont understand why your version is not the same as the one sold by the CCSF? I have no alternative but to return the replacement but to keep the first copy that I have paid, because I have already used part of it and you cannot replace me with the one I want.Willis Zhoe"
negative,"Could it get any worse?: Poor Brandon. He was so close to being the next indiana jones, but this movie crushed him. It was brutally bad, the story line was exactly the same as the first. And could there be anymore mush in it? I mean you get the idea that brandon and his wife love eachother, but every 5 minutes they are gushing with how much they love eachother. Bad, bad, bad movie. And anamakson (I know the spelling is off) could she be any more modern day? She is supposed to be reincarnated and it is a terrible job. I can't tell you enough, rent it but do not waste your money owning it."
positive,"Easy Climax: I'm very pleased with this product because it has a natural feeling head and makes climaxing easyand can be used in the bathtub,shower or where ever."
negative,John's Story: Good book for those who haven't read the book of John in the Bible. I found the book to move very slowly.
positive,"Pulitzer Prize Winner: Not really a review, but I collect Ellen Glasgow books. It should be noted in her bio here that she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1942 for In This Our Life. I don't see that book here on Amazon, but it should be since it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. I saw that some say her books are ""overwritten,"" but you must take them in the context of when they were written. She is a wonderful author and depicts life in the South and rural America extremely well. Her real gift is her insight into her characters and what makes all of us human."
positive,"classic: Thuvia, Maid of Mars is classic pulp science fiction.Our hero is framed for the abduction of princess Thuvia, so he goes to rescue her and clear his name.It's also a pretty classic romance plot, with the hero and heroine in love with each other, but unsure how the other feels, and societal/political conventions standing in their way. *shhhh... don't tell."
positive,"POPSA: Its no secret that this band is a product. It has everything it needs to sell in the West: controversial as always lesbianism, iron courtain feeling and catchy melodies. I cannot imagine a better plan. With this in mind, just enjoy the cheesy music. By the way, this is good pop, with a smart musician behind and really good mixing. I think its the most crude evidence of the music industry of our times, so take it as historical evidence if you want to. I'd rather listen to this cyborg of a duo than to [bands] who really believe in their punk like Sum 41. Its all about who lies less to themselves.TATY is not TATU in russian - its just the ""y"" in cyrilic sounds like a ""u"" in latin alphabet. Al though they are from Moscow, they are not such a big thing in Russia. You see, Russians are not so easy costumers, and are not thrilled by the controversial, as is the West. And regarding the girls, they could be any two girls walking down Tverskaya St - they are ALL as beautiful, and more."
positive,"Uranium ore: This product is available at local grocery stores for $15.00 a tin. Found in the can tuna section, along with mercury. Promised to provide a""glowing"" complexion. This productis guaranteed to make you tingle where it counts! Beware of counterfeits! If not purchased at the grocery or 7/11 you are taking a chance of RADIATION poisoning. A serioushealth concern. This product is some times sold from the trunk of a car, back of a truck, back room of police narcotics, and evidence rooms. While the price may sound good,ha! Stick with the trusted source for your genu- wine, uranium. Sorry no money back guarantees. See the professionals today for the BEST."
positive,"excellent analysis of the contemporary european mind: The book highlights the refractories of thoughts ,that the european mind has gone through , over a period from the dawn of history to our times ,in it's process of development to its present form.The classroom language makes it a formal read though."
positive,"work well but give you a slightly odd profile: They have a bigger opening than the soft shells, so they're much more comfortable. They work well to keep air on sore nipples. They make your boob shape a little strange, but not terrible, and it's definitely worth it."
negative,"Eck! Glam Trash - Ishtar in France: Never have I been so disappointed by a movie. Joan of Arc - France's patron saint - a real-life person, portrayed like a super hero. It might have worked better if they'd added the cartoon 'Sock' , 'Bam', and 'Pow' during fight scenes. All I can tell you is AFTER seeing this, I happened to catch ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" on Turner Classic Movies, and thought it was a contemporary film. I was shocked to learn the film was done in 1928! So my advice is to leave this 'glam trash Fishtar' version on the shelf, and buy the REAL DEAL instead - ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" (1928). ."
negative,"Binge: British Light Music: Never ordered it, it was sent by mistake and I returned it upon receipt without even opening it so I don't know."
positive,This book is awesome: Very compelling. Piri Thomas does an excellent job in depicting the struggle of a black Puerto Rican in New York. Touching and Inspirational.
negative,"Didn't last long: We had a prior Grohe model for many years that finally gave up the ghost. I called Grohe customer service and they were unwilling to repair or sell replacement parts. The only choice was to replace it.We wanted to stick with Grohe design to blend with the faucet, so we ordered this.It lasted not much more than a month. Too long to return to Amazon and it's probably not worth my time with customer service."
positive,"Great soothing crib toy: I bought this for my 6 month old baby boy. It is very soothing and provides a mild light when he wakes at night. I go to his crib, turn on the Ocean Wonders Aquarium, and can see to find his pacifier. He goes back to sleep with the soothing music and light shuts off soon. He is now 8 months old and can turn it on by himself."
negative,"I love the Bodeans but not Sammy's solo effort: I have every Bodeans album ever made (my favorite is the live ""Joe Dirt Car""), I have seen them in front of 200 people as well as 15,000 people (at Milwaukee's Summerfest) and absolutely love them. I was anxious to listen to Sammy's solo effort but have to admit it is not a CD I listen to often. The theme of the album is extremely dark and the CD simply depresses me.I am eagerly awaiting Kurt Neuwmann's solo effort (coming July 25, 2000). As the other half of the Bodeans songwriting duo, his album will likely be much more upbeat musically but still have great words...we'll find out in a few weeks."
positive,Measure of a Man Measures Up: This musical offering was a superb display of Clay's versatility and powerful range. I keep changing my mind on which song is my favourite. I find myself humming bits of each song when I am alone or walking along the beach. My only regret is that it may take some time before a second album is released and I am already anxiously awaiting that event and will definitely pre-order. Measure of a Man is my all-time favourite cd to listen to and I'm 49 years old so I've listened to a few!
positive,"Too much set up, not enough pay off: This book is the story of Sally and her sister Gillian. Sally and Gillian were orphaned when they were younger and raised by their aunts who were the town witches. The girls' childhood was hard and both looked forward to a time when they could leave the staring and name calling and mean spiritedness behind.The writing in this book has a magical quality to it, although there isn't that much magic mentioned in the book. I would have liked more 'magic' sort of like in the movie. Another thing that bothered me about the book was that they spent a majority of the book setting up the big problem and it all got resolved within a few pages and tied up nicely with a little bow. That part just seemed rushed.I did like reading more about Sally and more about her daughters. I liked the charm that Hoffman brought to the novel and I would be interested in reading more of her work."
positive,Great Movie: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I could not believe the price I picked this CD up for - very reasonable.
negative,"A padded short story disguised as a literary novel: The kindest description of this book would be that it is well-written and quite pointless. The plot is paper thin and all the characters (with the possible exception of Mr Hilditch) are either two dimensional or borrowed from other, more superior, works. The much-touted plot twist, when it finally arrives, lacks any irony and seems contrived. William Trevor is best known as a short story writer and this book is essentially a short story padded into a novel. As a well-written, mildly diverting, piece of light entertainment it would have been acceptable, as a prize-winning piece of high literary pretensions, it is not. Dickens, Poe, even Highsmith have succeeded much better in what Trevor seeks to achieve."
positive,"...the abyss also gazes into you.: Simply excellent. The Abyss was already a favorite of mine after seeing it in the theaters, it's even better with the expanded scenes. It's another great, original work from the director of Aliens and Terminator...not to mention Titanic, the biggest money-maker of all time.Movie aside, whether or not you liked the movie, you HAVE to see the making of the abyss. This WILL give you a healthy respect for the movie, the actors and everything involved with bringing this film to life. I had no doubt after watching it that this had to be the most incredibly difficult film to ever have been made!The Abyss is a great sci-fi flick. It's entertaining and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Five Stars...two thumbs up...what else can I say? Check it out!"
negative,"Boring, Senseless, Waste of Time: Don't waste your time. If you are watching it to see the controversial steamy sex scenes, you'll be disappointed. There is nothing erotic here. It's a film devoid of emotion or excitement. It's mind-numbing and boring. It may have been praised at the time it was first released, but it has not aged well. Surprising that it was ever determined to be a film with any value even when first released. Pointless film with characters that don't seem to have any direction in their lives and don't seem to care about anything important. The viewer doesn't care either. Glad I saw this free, as I would hate to have paid even $1 to watch it. Your life will be better for NOT having seen this movie."
positive,"Excellent, classic, but...: I'm going to review this briefly as a book for children, which is what it is. I read most of this to my 3-year-old (including all the limericks and most of the poems, and a little of the other stuff). As long as I didn't read it too often, my son was usually game for this. He liked it but he didn't love it to pieces. The nonsense and silliness certainly appeals to silly little kids, and why shouldn't it? And as far as I'm concerned, it's excellent, and deservedly considered classic children's lit., but frankly, I didn't think it was five-stars great. The conceits and poetry are not always exactly inspired, and the illustrations are pretty crude, although plenty entertaining.""The Owl and the Pussycat"" (which we've read many times) and some of the limericks are definitely five-star selections in any case.At $5, this is a nice cheap edition. It would help if the pictures were in color, but I gather you're getting it closer to what was published in the 19th century here."
positive,It's Ghost Rider!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This ActionFigure is awesome! The box claims that it is Johnny Blaze. But upon further investigation it is acually Dan Ketch as the GhostRider. Typo's aside this figure is boss.
positive,"GOOMBA! FUN FUN FUN!: I love this video! The only thing that kept from a five star flick is because it only had some of the original Mario Bros music during the beginning-""A loong time ago..."", also, in the part before they get saved by fungus, Mario says ""I can't stop it! It doesn't have any brakes!"" is totally bogus. Because when they were in a COP car, between two COP cars, he BRAKED which helped him lose the dopes. I still love it! Rent it though, before you get it(if it's even possible to get it)."
positive,"Growing Up with CP: i HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WREN WAS ONE OF MY FIRST lOVES I HAVE CP AND IT HELPED ME TO UNDERSTAND MY OWN CP.UNLESS YOU KNOW THE TIME-FRAME IN WHICH THIS WAS WRITTEN,YOU CAN NOT UNDERSDTAND HOW HER MOTHER FELT. I LIKED IT"
positive,"A Knitter's Pleasure: I bought this book for my granddaughter and she was totally enthralled by it. She loved the pictures, asked questions about everything and, because I am a knitter, she carefully studied the different hats for the characters. She had to nap with it after I had read it-a sure sign of a great kids' tale!"
negative,"I don't like this company: I own The Jack Benny Collection from this company :Passport Video. It has plastered in the bottom of the screen :""THE JACK BENNY COLLECTION "" and it was very distracting! I knew what I was watching, for heaven's sake! Oh,well!"
negative,"Nice scenery, but MAD CHEESIE storyline: I was pretty darn cheesed out by this movie. It's definitely nice to look at, and Diane Lane is a very lovely woman. However, the characters were all sugary sweet cheeseballs, and Diane Lane's character had no spine.Sandra Oh was great, as usual."
positive,"read mi review. sorta like ads.: this book rocks, people! however, i got reali confused withnyala's character. what's up with her aniway? split personality?aniway, i reali loved rashel and quinn though they were always at each other's throats!! enjoy this book! p.s : if u're reading these reviews to decide whether it's worth ur money, i tell ya, get it QUICK before it's all gone!"
negative,"not satisfied!: i was listening to this and i noticed that this is a rip from a whole bunch od Insane Clown Posse cds, if u truly listen to ICP na dhtne listen to this cd you will notice that they are very similar and unfortunately for KISS, the songs that they related theirs to were out before this cd came out. I was not satisfied when i heard this cd!Juggalos stand tall!"
negative,"Liked it but did NOT Last: I got this vacuum about 9 months ago. I loved it. It's the best vacuum I have ever had. The wind up cord is fabulous. It had a lot power. The emptying process was convenient as were the accessories. Everything was great, but one day it just quit sucking up and started spitting everything out. There is a thin layer of white fuzz on the front of the vacuum after I use it. The debris just gets spit around to new places, not sucked inside the vacuum. I am disappointed it did not last longer."
negative,"Jeff the Scorned: I hated this story. It was long. It was preachy. It was boring. Unless you're interested in catching up on battles with Puritanism, avoid this book."
positive,"Best Tweezers ever!: I never really thought much one way or the other about tweezers, but after hearing good things about Tweezerman, I thought I'd splurge. They work so well! They effortlessly pick up hairs you can barely see, and since it grasps the hairs well, it doesn't hurt as much as cheaper tweezers."
positive,The best of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!: What is wrong with you lot??!!! This is a great movie and I have to say that this is better than the first one!!! Not to say that that one was mediocre. It was great to but I love this one even more! McClane finds himself fighting vicious terrorists whove seized a major international airport with many planes stranded in mid-air and McClane has to save the passengers on the planes and destroy the terror network before fuel runs out and causes the planes to crash. This is a great movie and should be owned today!!
negative,"not impressed: it works ok and that's really all i can say, i just wasn't impressed. i already have straight hair and i thought this would help eliminate using a straightener, i just like having that shine and sleeker look, well it didn't really do anything a regular blow dryer wouldn't do. i don't recommend you waste your money."
positive,"To Much LOVE: This movie was definitly not the best of the first two films. They put to much love in the movie and you cannot do that with Thrillers or Action Adventure movies. If you want a good movie that does not put love first, go see Jurassic Park 3."
positive,"One of the better anthologies required: I was required to buy this for a British literature course. Usually books of this kind get resold since I'm not an English major, but this will be an exception. I enjoyed the collection of works they included and the introductions and footnotes included help with comprehension."
positive,"An online review!: This book was a very good story, considering it was written within the bounds of a comparison of the Protestant and Catholic interpretations of the Bible. Kennedy takes ideas from both sides of the ""conflict"" that many people face in their lives, and molds them into a wonderful tale of a young man and the struggle with his uncle's faith. From the death of his father to the ""questioning"" and mocking of himself and his faith, he takes on the challenges that are presented to him and prevails, while at the same time creating a will to change in his cousin, Eli. I feel that anyone having unanswered questions with their faith should read this."
positive,"Smart choice for NAS Drive: A perfect mate for the ADS NAS drive.The 750 GB version exceeds the limit of the NAS Drive, though Seagate kindly advises that the ADS NAS drive could probably take a 600 GB or maybe even a 640 GB HDD, but not a 750.Mine works very well."
negative,"Cliche characters and the kitchen sink: David Davidar has apparently never heard of the saying ""less is more."" His book has every cliche that you can connect with India -- the caste system, extended families, wretched poverty, etc, etc. Of course, all these exist, but they should be included in a book only if they further the story. Perhaps that is just the problem. Davidar has a hard time getting a believable story together.Stick to publishing, Davy baby! Leave writing to those who have the talent."
positive,Very pleased: It was an unexpected holiday gift for my husband. He was thrilled to have a new toy for his golf bag! Works great!
negative,"Missing part, horrible Hoover service: Right out of the box it was missed a crucial component (the only screw required). Dealing with Hoover's customer service was an absolute nightmare. They never sent me an email response when I submitted a request through their online form. Their phone hours are ridiculous (closed by 2:30pm PST). And their customer service number is a long-distance number. They have an 800 number, but it's only for automated stuff that doesn't resolve anything.Not Amazon's fault. Hoover just sucks."
negative,"HELP: this does not work please help, reads on the computer not in the dvd player help!!! kids very unhappy please help"
positive,"Great Book, But Very Different from the Movie: The author of this book personally told me that the book differed quite a bit from the movie, and she wasn't exaggerating. That is the reason I read it. The movie is one of my favorites. In the novel, the story focuses a lot more on the third generation, Sally's daughters. They really only appear as children in the movie. Although, I love Alice's books, in some ways, I liked the movie version better. It is so well done. However, it was great to read the book, because for me it expanded and deepened the story. I recommend it for everyone, whether or not you are a fan of the popular movie.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel ""To Be Chosen"""
positive,"For a cool & mellow head in todays world.....YOU NEED THIS!: If there ever was an album that says ""Roll Another Number"" it's this mellow, funky little gem. Whenever I listen to this I want to call up the bro's for a BBQ, chill out with some 40's rollin' fatties and talkin' about the ladies. OH YEAH!! If you like this music check out ""Jalamanta"" and Che- ""Sounds of Liberation"" if you can find'em. This is music for the people..Get it on!!"
positive,Haven't disappointed: Have awlays used Pjur or Eros... and they haven't disappointed. Cannot comment on how it is beneficial to women as the name indicates.
negative,"Recycled and Reused: Measure of a Man should read Measure of a Boy. His ""so-called"" music is only been recycled from previous performers such as N-Sync, Backstreet Boys, etc. Isn't there anyone out there with an original voice or original music that they write themselves? This guy is not even worth watching as I witnessed one night on Jay Leno's, Tonight Show. Give me Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, even Luciano Pavarotti! At least these guys can and did sing with soul and a lot of heart, something this kid should learn before he releases another song. Even my 15 and 17 year old kids just can't get into this guy's singing. Sorry Clay!"
positive,"Sioux History: Great read...Little Bid Horn battle and the US attempt at geocide with the Native American population in a short, fictional format."
negative,"Drama-soaked impossibly complicated drivel: OK... for years, White Wolf hints that the East is a big bad place full of big bad vampires... And then they publish Kindred of the East. It's an anticlimax that should never have happened; someone fell asleep at the switch. Between the over-numerous virtues, restrictive societal protocols, uberdisciplines that let a KoE crush an opponent, and an unbelieveably complex system of rules that makes playing next to impossible, this book is not worth the nearly $30 you have to pay for it. Skip Kindred of the East if you can; if not, don't say you weren't warned"
negative,dont buy: horribel its a copy of the origanal and it is so dark that you can hardly see ant thing that is going on
positive,gilad the best yet: i started working with gilad when i first viewed him on cable televison. since working with gilad i have been very happy with my results which can be noticed within a 30 day straight workout of about 3 days per week. i started with the fat burning workout which only lasted about 3 months and managed to lose about 8lbs of fat. i then switched to the toning and abs workout which results came within a months time. i have yet to see anyone who can compare with the health and mind management that gilad can provide to my self worth. i would recomend these videos to anyone and hope to see these videos on the market for a very long time. thank you gilad!
positive,Love :): These worked great for my twins! super easy to manage with a squirmy infant! We had switched from cloth and tried a few other brands but these worked best.
negative,Dont use this as vag cream!: I was hoping to get to warp factor 8 with my girlfriend. Instead she turned into Hulk and tossed me through a wall. Now shes in the park fighting with the National Guard.
negative,"5 stars for content; 2 stars for the format: Avoid any edition from bnpublishing -- this is the second I have unsuspectingly bought and both are laid out exceptionally poorly, to the point that they are difficult to read.I think this book was taken from an ASCII text file in the public domain, copied and pasted into Microsoft Word, then printed. It is that amateurish.If you can get past the hard-to-read format (weird line breaks, missing paragraph indentations, typos, etc.) this book will change your life."
positive,"A marvelous, splendid gift on the Catholic Faith: The book ""A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court"" is marvelous, a splendid gift for setting forth the truths of our Catholic faith clearly and precisely. And oh, how this is needed in these times of crisis and confusion in church catechesis. A must read for every Catholic of all ages, religious and clergy included, and a great book to share."
negative,"One Extended, Boring Song: Clay said he's not an artist and he's absolutely correct. This CD is so unbelievably over hyped for a worthless collection of mediocre pop tunes sung by a mediocre singer who could not put emotion into a song if his life depended on it.Total manufactured crap."
negative,"Not What it is Made Out to be...: It shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation. It may have much symbolism and so on, but it is a convoluted mess. The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses."
negative,"Dog won't touch it: My dog is a lab and like most labs, will eat anything and I do mean anything and everything, except for this stuff. No matter how little was sprinkled on my dog's food or what I mixed it in, he would not touch it. Thankfully Amazon issued a refunded."
positive,"Nursing as a Ministry: Again, Sr Mary Elizabeth O'Brien has writeen an excellent book. I give this book to nurses when they graduate. It truly puts nurses in an angelic and spiritual perspective which they deserve."
positive,"Bulk + free shipping = good: Significant savings buying these in bulk. Pampers fit our little one better than the other brands, but your results may vary. Regardless of brand, always try to buy in bulk."
positive,"how tess' motherhood experience change her life...: Tess, a naive and young girl whose one night relationship with her cousin Alec ruins her life, is a great example of a woman in love who would do anything for her husband and nothing for herself. Tess is a great book to read. I NEED HELP AND SOON IN LESS THAN A WEEK I HAVE A TERM PAPER ON TESS DUE (THE CONSEQUENCES OF MOTHERHOOD BEFORE BEING WED IN ENGLAND IN THE 1800'S AS SEEN IN TESS) PLEASE IF YOU HAVE ANY MATERIAL THAT CAN HELP ME EMAIL IT TO ME. tHANKS IN ADVANCED!!!!!"
positive,"Simple: If you are patient enough to finish it, you will like it: But if you give up before, it will not make sense to you and excuses will start to appear. This book is hard work, but only hard work yields great rewards.Best book in Latin American history and one of the 5 best books in human history."
positive,review DVD Quest for Fire: Good movie. Fun to watch. Glad I bought it. Can recommend it to everybody who likes SF/fantasy and/or likes an heroic movie without heroes.
positive,The Mill on the Floss: I have thoroughly enjoyed every George Eliot book I have read. Daniel Deronda and Middlemarch are two of my all time favorites; now will add The Mill on the Floss to the list.
positive,"Lego doors, windows, and roof tiles: Great for kids who like legos and never have enough doors and windows. Will keep them busy for hours."
negative,"Turns off frequently! Irritating!: I ordered this when I got a new Dell desktop and needed to connect with the wireless network in my home. It was easy to set up but that is the end of the good news.This adapter just randomly looses its connection to the network. In the space of one hour, it will loose its connection at least twice, if not three times. Reconnecting is no problem - I just click on Repair and it goes through the motions and connects back right away. I reinstalled it a few times but the same thing happens.This is a very irritating feature, especially when I am using Skype! I have had enough and I am ordering a new adapter from a different manufacturer!"
negative,"LOTS OF FAKE REVIEWS: I just wanted to point out that a lot of these reviews are fake, probably from the publisher. How do I know this? Because people from Laguna Beach, California do not spell favorite like ""favourite"". Try harder next time publisher."
positive,"Love this petit kitchen: I love this little kitchen. We might have to buy something bigger because we have so many kitchen pots, pans, food and such....but we will still hang onto this kitchen. My 3 kids love it! Also, it can be assembled in minutes!"
negative,"You get what you pay for, and we didn't pay much :-(: The fit of the fitted sheet is LOUSY - the first night we had it on the mattress, it came off. I guess Amazon sold them cheap to get rid of them.DO NOT BUY THESE!!"
positive,Way beyond totally supercallifragilisticexpialidotious: I love this book. It my favorite book ever some day I wish to make another movie out of it. I am already writing the script. In the script I am at the part where they are getting horses at Therinsford. I love Cristopher Poalini (the author of this book's) Imagination. It must of tooken him years of had work to write this. I can't wait till the fourth one comes out.
negative,"Rlowe: The speakers carry mid and high range fairly well, however, they lack a serious bottom end. If you are looking for strong low range, look elsewhere."
positive,"cheaper on overstock: I have bought sensus memory foam pads for every bed I have had to sleep on in the last few years, and I love them. [...] My first Sensus mattress topper was a 4 inch version from a bedding website and that did cost me over 400 and I still felt that it was worth it, but i would have given up the inch and just gotten the 3 inch version on overstock if I knew it would cost less than half that. The shipping costs on overstock are almost nonexistant as well. Maybe the person who said it wore out after 5 years wouldn't be so upset if he/she only paid 170. That would work out to only $34/year."
negative,"The Shelters of Stone: A total disappointment. I bought the book hoping that the authorhad returned to the wonderful storytelling skill she demonstrated in The Clan of the Cave Bear and the Valley of the Horses. By the time of her fourth book, The Plains of Passage she had almost abandoned the story and was so dedicated to flora and fauna that it was hard to read the book. The Shelters of Stone is even less interesting than the previous book. If you took out the part that was devoted to the characters that I wanted to read about the book would be only a few pages. Jean Auel either needs to get back on track or she should start writing educational textbooks. I absolutely will check out her next book before I waste any money on buying it."
negative,Hairiest Western Ever: This is the hairiest western ever! Never before has there been so much wet chest hair in a wash tub with dry ice....as in the scene where the brothers bathe together. (Ooooooo....kinky!). And what is up with the dry ice. Are they supposed to be bathing in boiling water?This sums up this whole never-ending joke of a western. Lame TV at its best....which means don't bother....unless you like real hairy cowboys!
negative,"great player for about 9 months....: I was very satisfied with the product in the beginning. I could burn my collection to about 4 CD's, and then I could go wherever I wanted, and be able to call up any song I wanted. I was especially impressed with the T-Digit function...That was 9 months ago. Things have since grown progressively worse. Now, I find that it doesn't play MP3 CD's anymore...It only plays Audio CD's now. I tried to contact the D-Link support people, and got a prompt, but unfruitful response. They told me to return it to them, and to do so by contacting the RMA department...so i cantacted the RMA department, and recieved no response...It's been over a week, and still no response! So much for customer satisfaction...If they had created a descent product, I wouldn't be dissatisfied, and I would be writing this review with a seriously different tone..."
negative,Dumbbbbbb: This is one of the worst Adam Sandler movies out there. This is a rental only and not worth buying.
negative,Tedious: There's no doubt this novel has a good story line. The main problem I had was getting to it. I labored through so much descriptive prose that I often forgot where I was in the story. It was a chore to finish and I have come to the conclusion I should not read any more Pulitzer Prize winning novelists. This is my fourth and none have been half as good as a Glass Castle or Memoirs of a Geisha or many others with less acclaim.
negative,"Count of Monte Cristo: Story has good twists, but there are too many French places and people which makes the audio confusing."
negative,"Bad Psu cant run in asus and intel 965wh boards!!!: This Power Supply cant run in a asus boards, and many intel 965 boards ...and in other because the anemic +5v and +3.3v 17A and 23A, and today the power needed is minimun 25A and 35 A in this rails.

positive,This is A game that brings a world that could be hours: this game and the music it has bring and emotional feeling to me its a great game but ts more than a game its a way to show us that our world could be just like that in a few thousand years or so they are already making flying cars by the way what makes you not think that the future world can be just like that
negative,"waaaaaayyyyyy smaller than advertised: Just received this bag for my very slightly taller than average three year old, and there is no way he will be able to use it. This bag is advertise as being 50"" long, and he is only 39"" tall and it is way too short for him. I will be returning this asap. I have no idea how on earth they measured 50"", but it most definitely is not. I would say that a much shorter than average two year old could possibly use it for one season, but no longer than that. Don't waste your money on this bag."
positive,The Hobbit Review: I bought this book because I wanted something to read.I like the Lord of The Rings Triology and thought I should read the book of the triology.I liked this book sooo much that I read it in one day!I liked this book alot!!!!!
negative,"O Rating For 0 Book: Really if it's not even published why is it here? Hopefully it will not be published. Other works you have attempted to write and call 'books' are filled with such foolishness about the Craft that it is impossible for anyone to know what you as a writer are trying to establish in the literary field. It is obvious you have many names and many beliefs which have shown as contradictions to one another throughout your books. Even many of the young people are picking up on it. But some of the youth are much more aware and not as gullble as adults in the Pagan world. But I don't have to tell you that. Otherwise you wouldn't bother to publish this book ""Costumes, Receipes and Spells"" Is it your contention to insist that all this is what the holiday Pagans celebrate is connected with. Oh, Silver your truths are beginning to come out, don't you think? What goes round, comes round and it comes round in multiples."
negative,"HARD TO FINISH: I found this book not worth the $$, it was well written but too sweet and hard to finish. Definitly not a page turner."
negative,I hope the second GPS works better than the first one.: The GPS worked fine for a couple of days and then it never turned on again. I sent a mail to DIGITECHDEALS and they told me to send them the GPS and they would send me a new one. The new shall arrive this week. Fast response from DIGITECHDEALS.
positive,GREAT BOOK! A MUST BUY!: If you want to know about your man or womans dark side! And what makes him/her tick! this is the book for you! Its very insightful! After reading it i think i understand why my man acts the way he does! thanks Amazon!!
negative,"You'd have better luck with scotch tape.: Let me just say, these are awful. They don't take any hair with them, I've followed all directions properly and tried a whole sheet of them but none of them worked.Don't waste your time or money on this product."
positive,"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat: Wonderful show. All my friends have borrowed it and love it also. The only problem I have with this DVD (and most others, to be honest) is that the volume of the TV needs to be turned WAY up in order to hear it."
negative,"Have we no shame: It's a crime and a sin what was done to E.B. White's classic children's novel. Heartless Hollywood got hold of it, ripped its guts out, threw in some snazzy effects, irrelevant slapstick, and rock music, and dared to call it ""Stuart Little."" All in the name of money. I'm not saying some six year-olds won't have fun watching it, but for the love of integrity, someone please read them the book."
positive,"""15 year old son loves them!"": Got these for our 15 year old son. He wears them with a pair of dark rinse skinny levi jeans, leather studded punk belt and a tee. Gotta have these shoes to get that ""rocker"" look. Only con about the shoe is that within a couple of weeks, one of the metal eyelets(for ventilation) on the side of the shoe fell off. However, the insole is thicker and cushiony compared to other cheaper knockoffs, like at Walmart. Anyhow, our son loves them and would give a 5 star rating, but I gave a 4 star rating for quality."
negative,"Big Brother Lives: Amazon offered 1984 for its Kindle E-book reader, but then the electronic version's publisher decided it didn't want to make the book available that way. So Amazon deleted the book from the Kindles of customers who had already purchased it and credited their accounts. A small problem: what about annotations people had made on the book for their term papers? A big problem: what if I buy a book by a liberal and Amazon decides they only like books by conservatives, so they delete the book from my player? This is a despicable action, and I will be boycotting Amazon until they publicly change their policy. There are plenty of places to buy books online."
negative,"Completely UNREVISED AND OUTDATED!: I was very disappointed in this book. I have found shop set up for effecient layout and dust collection to be the most important aspects of my woodworking. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to be as effecient and effective in these areas. I could find no difference in this book and the earlier version it replaces. Even the photos are same outdated photos that appear to be taken in the late 70's used in the 2001 release. Please, Taunton, don't insult your readers by continuing to regurgitate the same information with a shiny new label in an attempt to sell more books. Please strive to produce new and relevant photos and information. Your books and magazines are already some of the most expensive, it would be nice if the quality matched."
positive,"I CAN PLAY THIS ON MY IPOD: For all you reviewers who have been complaining that this CD is unplayable on iPods, I just want you all to know that I have not had any issues transferring the music on this CD onto iTunes for the Mac and my iPod."
positive,A whole new expierience!: Wow! I never expected this to be this GOOD! I mean sure it shouldn't win an academy award but this is full of delightful suspensful and religious twists and turns as my old pal freddy has his eyes on a little boy and his mother. I was suprised that in this one they were actually making the freddy movies within the movie! A great Nightmare!
negative,"Offensive and Out of Date: I agree that the first chapter is enough to make an enlisted wife cry or walk away from the book altogether. Most of what I read is now completely out of date and relating to a military that is very little like what we've experienced the last 10 years my husband has been in. I think the basic assumption that will make the enlisted wife feel offended is that all enlisted wives secretly wish they were officers wives. I see little reason to read this book now-days unless it is for posterity's sake. There are better, newer books out there. Ones that more accurately paint the picture of the current military wife. Look for those and skip this one altogether!"
negative,"millions spent on fx, hundreds spent on story development: One reviewer described _Gladiator_ as 'one of the best movies ever,' and adds that 'if you liked _Braveheart_, you'll love this movie!' That ought to tell you everything you need to know. I will never cease to be amazed at the amount of praise that was heaped on this movie. The story dragged on and on; historical verity was pure Hollywood, so far as I could tell; and nothing seemed so important as pretty scenery and luminous cinematographic effects. Finally, the dialogue was nothing short of embarrassing--towards the end, my friend and I gave up all efforts to conceal our laughter. Neither Crowe's bedrock solidity nor Joaquin Phoenix' Fiennes-like homoerotic flamboyance could save this film (check out the latter's 'busy little bee' tirade). If you *must* see this film, get extremely high first--your critical faculties will require dulling in order to get through it."
positive,"pertty good: I do enjoy this ablum and would recommend it. I am not sure if it will be found to be as strong as some of their other music, however, it you are a Garbage fan, I think this will work for you."
positive,"IT IS A BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CANNOT BE SCARED.: A HORROR BOOK CANNOT GET BETTER THAN THIS;G.M HAS A WAY WITH WORDS TO SCARE THE BEJEE'S OUT OF YOU. HIS STYLE , PROSE AND CHARACTERS ARE ALWAYS REFRESHING , ENTERTAINING AND NEVER LACKS TO GRASP YOUR ATTENTION AND INTREST. ANY LADIES THINKING G.M IS A GREAT AUTHOR WRITE TO ME VIA E-MAIL."
negative,"Well written , but disturbing!: The purpose of this book was to reveal the loss of innocence. Lord of The Flies was well written and very descriptive. I hated reading this book with a passion. I personally wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because it is disturbing.I guess there are certain types of people who like to read books like this and I'm not one of them."
negative,"Case doesn't fit phone properly: The case I had didn't fit properly - the window obstructed the rightmost side of the display. You could shift it over, but it would always shift back. I don't know if they are all that way (maybe I got a bad one?), but I didn't want to buy another one to find out."
positive,"funny!: The short film was not what I expected, of course I didn't know quite what to expect either. The first-comer, Colten Hooker was spot on playing the awkward and mischievous Harry, a demon who lives amongst angels in the Mormon town of St. George, Utah. The film follows a TV crew as they document a day in the life of Harry. The subtle humor made me chuckle more and more on repeated viewings. The sound was very professional, not to mention the stellar camera work. The production team behind this short video really went above and beyond. I really loved the film."
positive,"Simply Wonderful!: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is one of my favorite books of all time. It touched my heart in the same way that Angela's Ashes did. To immerse yourself in the childhood tribulations and joys of a time when life was positively brutal in many ways...it makes you appreciate the society we now live in, flaws and all. Wonderful!"
positive,"Good set for roof tiles: This has the more shallow sloped roof tile. There is another type that is steeper. They do connect, they are just not the same pitch.This is an excellent set to be able to get enough roof tiles to actually cover the roof of a house. It is a bit expensive, but it's not too easy to go about it any other way.The doors and windows are a very large scale. They're just fine, too, if you like this size. I'm not a fan, myself--I like the older style of doors and windows. But those are basically out of production. I would think most kids would be fine with them."
positive,"The Hobbit: I read The Hobbit when I was ten years old and as a result found myself ensnared in to a world of fiction that transcended all of the books I had read before. The Hobbit's fastidious and succulent detail overwhelmed my juvenile psyche and truly pulled back the veil of what was to me at the time a world of brilliant literature, ensconced within the lugubrious arcane words upon the pages of tomes I feared to open. This book is the perfect initiation for a young reader into the imaginative majesty that is literature and I cannot recommend this book enough. I just purchased the e-book and have read it to my 8 year old daughter and she has read it back to me with the fire of illumination smoldering within her voice and scintillating from her eyes. So, yeah I like the book."
positive,The book was great!: The conditions of the book were great their was nothing wrong with it no writing in it and their were no pages folded.
positive,"Very reliable: I just had the video circuit board repaired in my TV due to a lightning outage (1 to 2 seconds) for $245.00. I have had this unit in service for about six months for my home theater system including my TV. It handled several lightning interruptions flawlessly. I know there are better units specifically made for home theater systems, but they cost a LOT more than this one. Just make sure that you don't overload the unit with too much equipment (or buy a larger unit). Add up the amperage of your equipment. Especially protect these new HDTV systems. The repairs are astronomical and these lightning hits can really cause them damage.My computer is protected with a larger UPS. Ask any repairman - they will tell you that surges and drop-outs keep them in business!"
negative,"poor craftsmanship: This is much smaller than expected. you get what you pay for, and is equivalent of a key chain tool."
positive,"mosby's dictionary: it's been very helpful, i'm taking medical coding and there are things i did not know so i looked it up and was very helpful. i will continue using it."
negative,"Fighting for Survival: Have you ever had to fight for your own survival? In Lord of the Flies by William Golding, a group of kids crash on a deserted island with no adult in sight. The kids choose a leader, Ralph, who fights for the survival of the group.I felt this book was slow in getting to the turning point in the plot. When I did reach that point it changed so drastically it left me puzzled. Reading this book was a chore. I struggled to keep myself interested through every chapter. The characters behaviors kept changing and it made the storyline hard to follow. I do not recommend this book to readers who crave exciting and interesting plots.-Tim Fox"
positive,A wonderful help for those interested in the military: This is one of the easiest to follow books on the ASVAB test for those who wish to enter the military.
positive,"Captivating...Until the ending: Throughout the story, The Treekeepers held me captivated with the story of Bird, the land of Wen, and Bird's companions. But the ending left me feeling unsatisfied, and the story felt unresolved. I got the sense that the author rushed through the ending, or tried to blur it because she was unsure of how it should go. All in all, I thought this was a very good book, but unless there is a sequel, I think the ending was a let down."
negative,"Bad Bad Bad: I enjoyed the first movie. I didn't think the second was as bad as everyone thought. Wow, this one was just atrocious. I'm not going into specifics as I'm sure the other reviews have but do not spend the $4.99 on downloading this. Wait for it to come out on HBO or whatever."
negative,hillerman befogged: i am a long time fan of tony hillerman but this one has tested my loyalty. no question that it was abysmally edited but has anyone stopped to puzzle out where the villain at the end managed to get his truck loaded with the missing money since he's hardly had time to arrive and shoot up his partners. hillerman must have been working on a bad batch of peyote. harper collins should be ashamed of themselves
negative,"Not what I expected: I bought this tent for my 4 1/2 month old because it stated on the description that it offered UV protection. We were going on a family vacation and I needed something to protect the baby while on the beach. This product is a waste of money if you need it for the outdoors:1. It does not say UV protected anywhere on the packing - this is a lie. I contacted the company twice about this and they cannot provide me with an answer. They will not confirm or deny it, which is false advertising.2. There is no way to anchor the tent. The tent was blowing all over the place. I had to put bags inside to weigh it down. I didn't even put my baby in there for fear she would blow away. I brought it to the beach the first day and didn't even bother bringing it back.If you want the tent for play indoors it should be fine but do not expect to use it outdoors especially if it is windy or sunny."
positive,"Wonderfully Dark Masterpiece: I just bought Murder, and I've been listening to it all day. I don't really like country music, but after hearing the double CD Man in Black, I became interested in Johnny Cash's music. I really like the new themed cd's and when I found out about this one, I had to get it. All the songs have a story to tell, and they're all great. I can't wait to hear the Love album, but I'm sure it will be just as great as this one. Five stars all the way."
negative,Don't buy it: Well after my first one started turning itself off and requiring unplugged rest time before it would come back on I called Samsung. They shipped me a refurbished replacement and it worked for four days. Now it won't display anything. On to replacement number two...
positive,"I can't think of a good title at all: The negative reviewers here seem, more or less, to want this book to move faster, or get to some kind of specific point, and are upset that it doesn't. So I'll make this suggestion, if you are reading to get to the end of a book, don't read this book; you won't deserve it. Read a Michael Chrichton book or something. On the other hand, if you are willing to be swept into an epic story that is written (and translated) with style and grace, plotted with a mature sense of wonder, and will make you weep, laugh, and seethe with anger, then read this one.No matter how many times I reach the last page of this book, I never feel like I've ""finished"" it. it always pulls me right back into it."
negative,"If used without precision = OUCH: I went to the dermatologist to get what I was told was a wart, frozen off. It had been there for years so the dermatologist said it might be a tough one to treat, so after freezing it she gave me this wart stick, and told me to apply it every other night and cover it with duct tape. What she didn't tell me, and what was NOT listed on the instructions on the box, was that this stuff needs to be applied exactly to only the wart, because if it gets on any of the surrounding skin, it will burn it off. I can't tell if the product is working because it is just burning off more skin every time I use it and I don't think I'm going to continue using it."
negative,"A poor use of my money: I bought a new laptop and wanted a new printer. This wone came highly recommended from the story. It worked great for three months (of course, the length of the warranty). It now only states ""paper jam"" and after hours of time on the phone and with the hints on the web, I am going out to buy a new printer - I would certainly not buy this one, again."
negative,"Frugal Housewife: I was really hoping that this book would have up-to-date tips on saving money. A few pages into the book, I realized that rarely did the suggestions apply to today's world. I was only able to read just a few pages. Disappointing."
positive,makes a good thing better.: After reading the four agreements this book makes it more effective and is very worthwhile. If you like the first this makes it better.
positive,BEAUTIFUL PICTURES!!!!!!!: This book has the most beautiful pictures in a book that I've seen!!!!!! I do not know how someone could be so talented to be able to draw those kinds of pictures!
negative,PLOT TWIST RUINED BOOK!!!: At the very beginning I found Samantha annoying but she grew out of it after a few chapters. Then the book became so good until near the end where the plot twist took place. I did not see it coming. The book did not make sense after finishing the book. I felt like I was tricked. Spoiler alert - how could Samantha be Cecily? There were no clues and it was like I was looking at two different people. It did not make sense. Samantha never acted like she knew Gabriel. It was all business. I am just really upset because the book was so good and had to be ruined by the plot twist. I felt she only cared about herself. He was looking all over for her and she continued to trick her. I will never read another book by this author again. She ruined a perfectly good book.
positive,"Good product, but not really needed by younger people: This Product is truly a great product. I found out about this a few days ago. This really is a great product, and it is easy to use, but this isn't really needed by anyone 13-24 because we regularly tune into the radio and/or watch MTV almost everyday. I could see this useful for older people, probably 40+, but it isn't really too practical for a younger generation."
negative,"Just too awkward to read!: I hate people who don't explain their abbreviations. It took me thirty pages to realise that Oxper was an abbreviation for Auxuliary Personnel, and that this meant anderoids. I couldn't figure out the difference between Silvos, Silver Cross and the people wearing silver suits. I eventually figured out that Silvo was an abbreviation for Silver Cross and that they wore blue suits while the Crew, who are not silver cross, wear silver suits from time to time. Confused? Welcome to the club.I eventually got fed up trying to work out silly little enigmas like these, I lost whatever plot there was, failed to identify with any of the characters, and so the book has been dropped, unfinished. This, from me, is a testament to a bad book. I have finished some pretty bad stuff in my day, I am a finisher, and for me not to finish, the book has to stink like a skunk in a farting contest. Peeyouw!"
negative,"Not a fan: Nothing here that you can't glean for yourself if you have a PC and know how to use Excel. Anyone can run numbers and models, and really that's all you get.The ""writing"" (purposeful quotes) is painful.Buying this book is no different than putting a match to your money."
positive,"The Review: Kenichi is definitely worth buying. It's full of humor and action, and who doesn't think that a guying being shown up by a female martial artist is funny."
negative,"Captain Kidd: Not the Sea Hawk or Captain Blood by any means,but still enjoyable.With a cast like Laughton,Carradine and Scott it can't be too bad.Historicaly not very accurate and a little hokey.But then again it doesn't claim to be factual.Laughton is great as the scheaming Kidd and Scott as the hero is his usually heroic self.If you are a fan of this type of film,and i am,you will enjoy this picture."
positive,"Dorothy TumbiUmbi: When I was young Lorne Doone was set for our final year. I never fininhed reading or did I like it. This time I found it a very good and well written, enjoyed and liked it very much. A fine picture drawn of life in hard situations hardly comprehended in our modern existant. Well worth reaading this book. Thank you Amazon."
positive,"Smooth rhythms by real Jazz Masters!: Lionel Hampton (1909) belongs to the select group of great bandleaders and is one of the pioneers on the vibraphone. Typical is Hamptons rhythmical variation is his melodies, which in my opinion is a bit bebop-like.Oscar Peterson (1925) is a solid but smooth pianist, with experience in almost any period in Jazz. His style is complex and subtily smoooth ... He played with some of the great names in Jazz, which speaks for itself.Those two together make a great album, with beautiful melodies and offer an almost tender approach which can only be done by the great. The quality is fine, the music very relaxing. You could run it on the background all day, but its really too good for that! Listen and enjoy."
negative,"for dummies is right: I just read some of the positive reviews and I cant believe it! This book is so vague and so spotty, that it cannot be relied on at all. And on top of that, the paddy-cake paddy-cake language is downright obnoxious!!If you want to be able to actually do something, then I would go to the wrox programmer to programmer series specifically the professional active server pages 3.0."
negative,"Could Easily break a tooth: So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor."
positive,"The Classics: A true classic, enjoy reading it, seen different movies of it andstill enjoy it. Who wouldn't enjoy reading a swashbuckling adventure."
negative,The Real Jan was smart for letting the fake Jan take Over!!: I saw this and man was this corny beyond belief! Eve Plumb the real Jan turned this down. Smart girl! I love the original classic TV show though which yes can be kind of corny but not as much as that variety show!
negative,"Intriguing but very disorganized: I experienced this book in audio format and had quite a bit of difficulty following any sort of logical thread; so much so that I wondered about the viability of audio (something I've only recently started dealing with). It was therefore comforting to see so many other reviewers commenting on disorganization. Apparently, it's the work itself, not the format.That's a shame. The topic is a fascinating one. I wish it had been more cogently presented. At this point in time, I would say Jared Diamond is still the author to read if you are interested in this field. It appears that 1491 aspires to stand next to it, and might have succeeded with better editing. But as it stands now, it doesn't work."
negative,"Interesting stories - dry writing: You would have to be dead to not be touched by the stories in the book, but I found Mr. Brokaw's writing style a bit dry. The writing ended up sucking the life out of the stories."
positive,"First time roller user: I am stationed in the desert and riding outdoors, its just over 120 degrees. I bought this to keep up my fitness and I love to ride. These roller will kick your but. It took about two miles (computer on road bike) for me to learn how to balance. Also, I went to you tube to see if I could find any instructional videos for this product. These were the most helpful. [...], and [...]. I am really glad I bought these."
positive,"Great device; no more landline telephone!: Purchased this device to complete the elimination of our landline telephone. It did exactly as promised, with the added benefit of renting movies online; no more late night trips to the ""Red Box""."
positive,I wouldn't be surprised if you cried while watching Air TV.: I didn't know much about this Anime and only bought it because it looked somewhat interesting. What a great surprise! Don't let the cover fool you. It is a quiet anime but without making you want to go to sleep. It has a fantasy side to it but in a realistic way (if that makes any sense to you). It's very emotional..so prepare yourself for that. I recommend having some kleenex around while watching this series.
negative,"Much Ado About Not Much: Not a significant improvement over the Mach 3 in terms of closeness of shave or less nicks/irritation. Underneath my unfortunately tough & wiry facial hair is very soft & sensitive skin prone to redness, nicks and the whole gamut of after-shave horrors. For my money (excuse me if I choke up here) the Mach 3 gives the best results all around of an unavoidable daily experience."
negative,"Not as advertised: Exactly what I wanted--a well constructed nonstick saucepan. However, it was listed as suitable for induction cooktops and it did not work on mine."
positive,"Turned my child into a reader: My daughter is in 6th grade now and always has her nose in a book. But when she was younger she dreaded reading. That is until she read this book in the third grade and fell in love. Ever since she began this series she not only is always reading, but has turned from an under level reader to an above level reader and is now the child in class that has read more pages than any other in her grade (last year too).This series of books not only taught her to love reading and to love characters, but it opened up her imagination and changed the way she played. She and the nieghbor kids spent hours in the yard pretending to be warrior cats.Since this book started it all, I also spent time reading the series (and next, etc.) and could easily see why her imagination was captured. These books will always be treasured in our house and our memories."
positive,Perfect!: I found that this was very helpful learning material for young preschool aged children...you won't be disappointed in this product!!
positive,"Best song is missing!: Great, atmospheric soundtrack, truly haunting. My one major gripe is that they have every single track from the movie, even minor ones that play only momentarily, and yet they leave out my favorite one. The song that starts in quietly when Jack is watching the threesome through the binoculars and kicks in fully when it cuts to Sheri dancing for him. Such a great track and they didn't include it in the soundtrack. That track is what actually made me decide to finally spring for the album and is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me. If anyone has that track or knows where it can be found that would be greatly appreciated!"
positive,"An entertaining, fun adventure all the way: I don't generally read science fiction, in fact, I never do. But with all the hype - or lack thereof - surrounding the bombed Disney movie, I decided to read the book before the movie comes out on DVD. Yeah, it's a little silly, but it's still a fun ride all the way. I enjoyed the nonstop action, John Carter's superhuman strength, his gentlemanliness (is that a word?) and his ability to bridge culture gaps and help the locals overcome traditions of hatred and prejudice. He is a southern gentleman to the core. It shows in everything he does, particularly in his absence of lust for the beautiful princess Dejah Thoris though she is buck naked and gorgeous. He adores her totally and completely and treats her like the royal lady she is the whole time."
negative,"False Advertisement: The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied."
positive,"HD DVD Must own Movie: if you dont own this movie on HD DVD you must see it. Even if you have the DVD version spend the money and upgrade. this movie is not only a great movie but it looks stunning in HD. top 5 movie currently out in HD easily.For HD DVD I would say the movies you have to own are (in no order): Batman Begins, TMNT, King Kong, Serenity, Shrek"
negative,"Warning, if you equate Swing with fun, don't buy this.: I had high hopes after reading the reviews, but I really regret wasting my money. If I want to hear about fathers beating their children and the kids' painful begging not to be hit with that thing in your hand, Daddy, I will meet with my clients. Word-pictures to let us all in on how it feels to be abused by a parent is not, IMHO, appropriate lyrics for the wonderful fun I have dancing to Swing. Stick with the classics. Don't let depressed people or children near this. I even hesitate taking it to a CD reseller."
negative,"Nostalgic, Pre-1980 look back at the way it was.: This book was interesting in it's look back. I found no information that would have been relevent to the modern day casino, or the games of the 90's. Readers would be better served to use the price of this book in a modern day quarter machine."
negative,"Needed an exterminator for all the BUGS!: Slap my wrist for buying this game new. I should have waited 6 months. I couldn't find any support online for the bugs and when I finally got everything working, I forgot to turn my virus software off (plus you can't have a screensaver on either & you have to turn off background animations & shadows within the game) and it jacked up my computer BIG TIME. Wait awhile for them to fix this before buying it unless you like being ticked off."
positive,"Best overview for the Catholic world view: This is the most comprehensive overview I have read regarding the overall Catholic philosophy. If you are not Catholic, you may be offended by the basic assertion that the Catholic view of the cosmos is the sane view. If you are Catholic, you will be rewarded with a thorough, precise description of Catholic world view. For this purpose, this book is even better than the Catechism."
negative,"suckered: I was in the airport with nothing to read and there was a huge pile of Grisham's books. How bad can it be? Terrible. If it wasn't a ""Grisham"" it would not be published. He should stop preaching and write a good story."
negative,"Don't waist your money on this: This movie was a joke, a bad actor, and a bad story, makes it look like the Marine Corp gung ho killers."
negative,"Very mediocre: There's a couple of good track on Hours (Thursday's child, Something in the air and Seven) but overall it lacks quality songs. The instrumentation is a bit too passive and sparse too for my taste. In theory that could've worked well, since the lyrics are quite depressive and the overall mood is a heavy one, but it all sounds bit uninspired to me. Add to that the lack of inventive songwriting and you have a very mediocre album."
positive,"Classic: Excellent book. Finally needed to get a digital copy, my print copy is well, well worn.We'll see how the movie stacks up"
positive,"well worth the price: My Caphalon pans were very nice but getting worn, so I bought the smallest Analon pan as a test of the product before purchasing more. I think they are nicer than the Caphalon - certainly heavier and the surface is super non-stick. This is my second purchase as I am slowly replacing my old ones with Analon."
positive,"Very satisfied!!!!!!!!: I have not seen or slept on this mattress........bought for my daughter for a quick replacment.............she tell's me she thinks it GREAT.....I bought the twin size,and she tells me when she buys a full size it will be the same one. I have an inflatable bed she has slept on while visiting, and she said this is 100% better. I might add my daughter is not someone who is easily pleased."
positive,"Lovely book: This was a lovely read for me. I like fantasy very much. It was a fairly easy read and very enjoyable. I do agree that it wasn't entirely original as I would have liked. I kept being reminded of Tolkien like the other readers have commented, the elves characteristics are the same, as are the dwarfs and many other things written in the book. Also, does anyone but me kind of feel a little bit of a starwars theme here? riders - jedi, evil empire - evil empire, old, powerful evil king - old, powerful evil emperor, ect. lol. But all the same, who cares. Artist and writers are always inspirated and have used the same flavor from other artist and writers for years. At least the author of ERAGON used the ideas with taste. And even though there is a lot of familiarity in his books, there is also much of his own ideas and style that are very different. I can't wait for the next book!"
positive,"we're enjoying cooperative games: I purchased this game and Max. We've enjoyed both cooperative games, and would recommend them especially if you play a lot of games and get tired of the competition. The Max game is definitely more popular in our house - maybe because it's hard to win playing the secret door?!? It is fun, but not quite popular enough with my kids for me to give it 5 stars."
negative,"Simply didn't work: It may have been a fluke, but when I got this cable I hooked it up to my TV and my PS3, set everything correctly, but no HD. We tested it out several times, even using a different TV and a different PS3 and an Xbox 360. Cable just didn't work. I'd recommend dropping a few dollars extra and just picking up a better cable."
negative,Don't buy this if you want it for your Kindle.: I purchased this Nursing2008 under a search I had done on Amazon for subscriptions for my Kindle. After I purchased it and realized I could not read it on my Kindle. I clicked to cancel the order (the magazine was not going to be mailed for like a month) and they are telling me they can't cancel it but I can send it back when I get it. What the #!#* is this????? Be careful about what you buy on Amazon.
negative,"PIAA are whiter: There brighter,whiter when I first used these I wasn't to impressed. After driving with them I could notice an improvement over regular lamps."
positive,Exceedingly good fun: Buy both Tao of Muhammed Ali and Zen of Muhammed Ali and Other Obsessions - and all of Davis Miller's other books! They are amongst the most important pieces of literature to have been published in the last 100 years! Simply mind blowing. And incredibly fun.
positive,"Fantastic shoe repair: My entire family has used this product since the seventies, and it is JUST AS GREAT as it originally was. You can repair shoe soles for your favorite running shoes, slippers, any rubber-soled shoes. You can put rubber on the bottoms of walking canes for stage, real life, etc. This is like rubber cement repair, only one hundred times better. Do you get the picture?"
negative,"Fantasy: This book may be fine as a fantasy, but I feel it is ridiculous to rewrite actual people's lives and rewrite history just for a buck. Much of this book is a complete fabrication, and I am afraid many will take this book as factual. Now it's a movie so even more people can be misguided."
negative,"a great book...if you could read it: Reading this book was a tremendous pain in the ***. The mystery and plot could have been greatly enthralling if I hadn't spent so much time trying to unwind Faulkner's sentences. Not only were the sentences long and complex, there were so many rambling thoughts between the action that I missed the thought and the action. I think Faulkner had a profound statement to say about social injustice and the South's part, but he certainly didn't say it in any way I could have understood it."
negative,SUPER ANTI SLIPPERY: This mat is SO anti-slippery you'll have so much trouble fitting it into the Hugger Mugger yoga mat bags.
negative,A good yarn: A reasonable read. Good story line although I expected it to be about captain cochrane himself. Worth a look at.
negative,"The Unknown Adam Smith - A suppliment to other reviews.: A short note for those about to enter into the world of Adam Smith - Take time to examine Book V, parts I-III. You'll notice that Smith, quite contrary to his Laisse-faire proponants, is elucidating the beginnings of Keynes, rather than the Milton Freeman view. ""The duty of the sovereign or commonwealth is that of erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works, which...[are] of such a nature, that the profit could never repay the expanse to any individual or small number of individuals, and which it therefore cannot be expected that any individual or small number of individuals should erect or maintain."" (Smith, Adam The Wealth of Nations, pg. 681)"
negative,"Power Wrapper not a durable machine.: I bought this PowerWrapper toy for myself. My 3 & 5 year old kids thought it was great fun to put coins in the bin and watch them sort. But after a month, the digital reader stopped working correctly. The flimsy metal tabs that record the number of each coin type wore out quickly, so the amount shown on the digital reader is worthless. After about six months the motor jammed, and I've been unable to use it since. They make a model without the digital counter, and I would recommend that one over this one. But as far as durablility, I give it a 2. If you are only going to throw your pocket change in it, then it's great fun. For anything else, buy something else that will last."
negative,"I own a Nikon 8400 and I'm considering this: Battery pack, but frankly it's a bit too pricey. And appears it would clumbersome to use. Especially in the horizontal position as the viewfinder is in lower postion. Anyway, the whole idea is to have more power available vs the battery pack which comes with the camera.Just make sure you buy NiMH 2300-2000 AA batteries.Great concept, but a bit too expensive, Nikon needs to price it more like in the $75 dollar price range, but consider extra battery packs cost only $42, well. You can see my point of view.You can buy alot of battery packs for $170 bucks.If you get one of these, make sure you post a review and what type of photography you do."
positive,"Loved it: I heard these were coming out, and it was approaching my birthday of last June, I got thise and play tickets from my mom after serious begging. She bought me them as soon as each one came out, funny thing is my best friend who doestn live at all close to me, got me the first one. But this is on the third one, it was a very well written book. The scenes between Buffy and Angel were pricless and touch the b/a shippers heart. A problem was of how much Buffy acted as if she loved Riley more than anything of the world, and Angel was past, why he dreamed about her and their forgotten day. Otherwise it is a good read, as a fan of either show, or the B/A or even b/r(gag) relationship. Just one thing to people who read my review or somethign that would never happen Nancy and Jeff read this, what the hell happend to Spike?! Is there a new crossover triogly in the making*looks hopeful*"
negative,"A waste of my time.: This is a cobbled-together story made up of various accounts of events by the participants, with little to recommend it, IMHO."
negative,"What a bunch of Bozos: This is not exactly top shelf drama. Mostly very juvenile type humor, if you want to call it that. Two thumbs down!"
positive,"How of the emotions are important for the better world!: This book show us how is important for the people to have good feelings and good thoughts. Perhaps, for the sceptic person this kind of experiment doesn't means anything. But I thing it's time to open our minds for the new experiments. The scientists who desagree, they must propose new experiments to refuse.It's time to people learn that our feelings and thoughts influence matter. All of the atoms and subparticles are vibrating all the time and our thoughts and emotions are vibration too. Hence, the waves are emitted by us influence the atoms and subparticles. So I can't understand the people refuse this kind of experiment without reflection!"
negative,"Not the original illustrations!: Shame on Harper Collins for re-releasing these books without Stephen Gammell's artwork! These ""new"" drawings are awful and ridiculous. Buy The Scary Stories Treasury instead, as it has all the original books intact."
positive,"I Love It!!: I think this is truly a wonderful CD. My favorites are Invisible, The Way, Shine, Measure Of A Man, and Touch.Clay is simply amazing; I believe his voice is truly amazing. But I also believe we have not heard the best that Clay could be. I agree that the songs on this album do not necessarily do Clay justice. Irregardless, I am loving this CD!"
negative,"Not A Good Introduction: I knew nothing about struts before picking up this book. I know just a little more after having read all that I can stand of it. The book provides very little example code and what it does provide is just in little snippets that don't really help. I'm halfway through the book and I can't take any more theory without being able to get some basic examples running. I consider this book more of a reference than a learning tool. I am abandoning it in favor of a different book. If you're new to struts, look elsewhere for a good introduction."
positive,Should serve as the basis for a required course in every Seminary: Well written - fast read - thoughtful - excellent footnotes.Clearly and forcefully refutes much of the fuzzy thinking of the last fifty years.
negative,"You get what you pay for: For our first child we had the quick cabana we loved it!! It however only survived two years with an active toddler, two dogs and a cat. This time we opted for a cheaper version intended for the beach. It is awkward to put up especially on a windy beach. You have to watch the direction of the sun because sun gets through all sides. The vecro closure is a pain. To weigh the tent down we had to put our beach bag in it not leaving much room for our nine month old. If you are looking for a tent for little ones to play inside and intend to keep it up this is the tent for you. If you want a tent for the beach or just to be outside. Go for the quick cabana. We loved that tent and wish we would have spent the extra money. This tent for us has become a playroom tent. You get what you pay for. Wish we would have gone with the quick cabana"
negative,"OK...: I didn't paticularly enjoy Lord of the Flies, but I must admit, it was fairly interesting... Lord of the Flies is a novel about a bunch of young boys deserted on an island with no adults or the presence of society, and all the complications that go with that. The whole book is a fight between right and wrong, order and chaos, and intellect and instinct-- Golding was trying to show just how much evil people have hidden inside covered by society, or in other words, that the only reason we ALL aren't savages is because society is always telling us we shouldn't be... A very interesting thought, one that I do in a way stand behind, but the actual PLOT and STORY of Lord of the Flies disappointed me, so I don't believe you should take the time to read the entire book; just maybe the afterword written by Golding."
negative,"Not their best stuff: Given that the band took a 4-year hiatus since their last work, they certainly could have done better than this. although the first single, Sleepwalker, is catchy, the CD is punchless beyond it. Gone are the rhythms that made songs such as One Headlight, The Difference, Heroes, etc. into radio hits. I expect sales to drop like a stone once people realize the CD has only one hit on it."
positive,"Excellent Early 20th Century Science Fiction: Once you accept the mumbo-jumbo elements of how Civil War veteran John Carter is transported to Mars, you can settle back and appreciate the remarkable fantasy world that Edgar Rice Burroughs describes. In a driving narrative that never lags, Burroughs succeeds in creating a multi-layered society rife with racial animosity and social unrest. Carter becomes the igniting spark, the focal point for societal change at all levels. This book is actually the first of a trilogy. Books two and three are ""The Gods of Mars"" and ""Warlord of Mars"" respectively. They are all excellent - so good you'll have trouble believing that they were written nearly a hundred years ago."
positive,"Messy, but works!: Be prepared for a nasty taste and slimy, slippery strips. But they really did work well. Don't believe the commercials that you can use these anytime, anywhere. Not unless you don't mind drooling on people in public. The strips slip all over when you try to talk or even swallow, and especially DON'T SNEEZE! But as for the whitening, I was pleasantly surprised. A lot better than I was expecting."
positive,"great shower filter: It was easy to install, and does a great job of removing the chlorine/chlorine smell from my water. I would definitely recommend this filter for anyone. It is very reasonable priced considering how long each filter lasts and is very effective."
positive,"High school requirement: My son needed this for school, and it was perfect. The book arrived in good shape and very quickly, so work could be done on time."
positive,"What kind of stupid person spoilers the entire horror movie?: Hey, I liked this movie a lot...in fact I saw it before it went into wide release at the Toronto Film Festival and Wes got a standing ovation. It's probably better than the original.But I can't understand why any Amazon reviewer would be dumb enough to spoiler the ENTIRE movie in their review. And they don't even warn you! Hey--It's a horror movie. If we wanted to know what happens beforehand, we'd ask ya. The point of a horror movie is to be surprised.If you're reading these reviews and haven't seen the movie yet, beware! There's a total spoiler post below, and you should skip it if you want to enjoy the film."
negative,"A Bronx Tale: This movie is great, one of my favorites, the DVD on the other hand was horrible, the quality was even worse, when I inserted the DVD it started the movie right away (no menu options).... the ad said ""NEW"" but when I received it, it was a copy, the image on the DVD wasn't even centered right, the cover was off color, I returned it for a refund.... VERY DISSAPOINTED....."
negative,This thing is GARBAGE...: I have this about 14 months...Over the last 14 months I used this about 4 times...Now it will not recharge...COMPLETE KRAP!!!Do NOT buy this brand...
negative,"What a Lemon: I ordered Flyboys because I had seen stills of the replica Neuports and they looked fantastic! As a lover of The Blue Max I hoped that Flyboys would exceed it largley because of advances in film effects. Was I wrong or what! A dismal screenplay peppered with gung ho naf lines paying scant attention to history. The best (worst) part of the film was the romance and our hero stealing a plane to rescue the heroine and her two young charges, for which the hero recieves a medal!! Yea right! But the one scene worth of ""the skunk of the year award"" was the hero landing his plane in a shell pocked no mans land to rescue his comrade traped under his aircraft, how did he do that? Will we ever find out?Well for me The Blue Max towers above this movie despite being over 40 years its senior. Flyboys is a dog worse than Pearl Harbour yes we have the technology but that cannot make up for a very poor and purile script and wooden acting."
negative,Defective: I had the Xantrex Powersource 1800 and it worked ok for 6 months then wouldn't charge so I returned it. I decided I needed a battery backup so I purchased the Xantrex Powerpack 600 and just out of the box it wouldn't charge or light up the LED light indicating it was trying to charge. I thought it might be the power cord so I got a new power cord and it still wouldn't charge. I starting to feel that Xantrex doesn't Test their products before they distribute them. I would rate it zero stars but one star is for Amazon and their return policy.
negative,"I wanted to like this but I have to be honest...: I was a bit excited to see this but I was dissapointed.I bet you know already the plot of this movie but I would like to point out the things that are ""wrong"" about this movie:1.The lovers in the movie does'nt have the chemistry2.Cheesy lines, specially the scene when theyre breaking up while having sex...EEEEWWWWW!3.Uma's character was'nt developed.4.Streep's (good performance,as usual)character does'nt really help the movie as a whole.These days,its really hard to find a good romantic movie and this one in particular is not good.Watch at your own risk."
negative,"Thought it was a must have but.....: Being quite tall and not petite, this pillow just did not fit well while breastfeeding, it put my son up to high. I had heard all the hype about this product and thought it had to be fabulous, but it just didn't fulfill my expectations. My son is now 4 months old and doesn't even like to be propped up on it for more than a few minutes!"
positive,"I was living in dustland until I got this great vaccum cleaner: I bought this hoover product from Amazon because of the other reviews, well all they were right,First It's really cheap compared with other brands and places you'd got the same for the double or even triple price. It's beautiful and easy to assembly, and the best, once you use it you'll see all hidden dust and debris under your carpet and you were living with it without knowing it was there, I was shock when I saw the filter and the compartment full of dust and particles, I can't believe I'd vaccumed the day before with my old vaccum cleaner."
positive,"Very good B horror film: The special effects are not up to par.The acting is good if a bit predictable.The direcing although a bit mechanical is better then average Hammer.The music is typical Hammer.Some corny horror exploitation scenesCris Lee looks way to young for his role.Otherwise for Hammer - one of their best looking and most expensive looking productions.Beautiful sets.Great story about Satan Worshippers.The screenplay by Richard Matheson is excelent and cannot be ruined.Great color, beautiful film stock and sound.This film should have been great with that story and screenplay and sets. - but if not a perfect film its is still great fun. In spite of the flaws it s entertaining, fun, colorful and delivers some good chills. The Anchor Bay version is beautiful and well worth owning for horror and occult fans. Even none horror fans will be entertained."
negative,overpriced/uncomfortable: These bra inserts are very stiff and tend toslip out of place on your shoulder----they arerather heavy/bulky and more uncomfortable thanhaving a bra strap dig into you! I have sincefound lightweight ones that stay in place allday and were $1.99 a pair--(commonlyfound in the lingerie sections of most dept.stores).
negative,"Pathetic: Please find something else to do for two and half hours.There is are so many things wrong with this movie to list, but I will say there was one redeeming quality of the movie and that was actor John Malkovich.As I said I am not going to go into all the things that made this movie horrible, but I will say for just about two hours I was hoping it would end and every time I had enough, John did his thing and I was back to watching the movie.I had thought number two was bad but his one was even worse and lets hope that they never make another one.Timahh"
negative,"So far no good: I have a Mach 3 and an electric. I'm not entirely happy with either of them. Electric sometimes doesn't cut sufficiently or else chafes off skin as well, leaving it flaky and the Mach 3 occasionally cuts me. Bought this Fusion a while ago and just got around to trying it. First impressions is that it's terrible. I'm glad I didn't buy any replacement cartridges. Cut my face all over the place. If manuals have a tendency to snag on your hairs at all, it's five time worse with this (since there's five blades to snag). Additionally, there's more space between the blade guards so it's easier to cut yourself - that is, I found it hard to shave along the curve of my face/neck etc.. It kept snagging and cutting me, despite the fancy vibration. I may give it another try without the battery on to see if it works any better, but so far less than impressed. The only positive feature is that the vibration makes it easier to rinse out hair than the Mach 3."
positive,"Magic world, real feelings.: ""The Princess of Dhagabad"" is a fine book not only by fantasy standards. It deals with many things beyond the seemingly straightforward plot - knowledge and power, duty and desire, destiny and will. Years of writing scientific papers affected the author's style - the language is precise and clear even when facing Unknown. The pace of the book is somewhat more relaxed than is typical for the genre but those extra words per unit of action are worth reading. The book is rather mild and kind in coping with harsh realities of life. Generally, fans of Conan the Barbarian saga will be disappointed; fans of J.R.R. Tolkien and G.G. Kay are likely to enjoy it."
positive,"Good but a few problems.: As everyone says not much about space. But I bought it because my kids love Little Einsteins, and that is good enough for me. My only real complaint is...I felt a little jipped when they had 2 episodes with the EXACT same song on it...back to back. (William Tell's Overature). Come on..there are enough great classical songs out there that we don't need any episodes to have the same song. And when there are only 3 episodes on a disc...I felt a little cheated. But it is still very cute and individually each episode is cute."
positive,"A well liked gift: I bought this for my father as a gift. He seems to really enjoy it. Being something he had in years past, the hand held infrared devices became a little hard to locate. While this one doesn't seem to have the super high build quality that ones did from years gone by, it does the job and as the gift receiver my father seems to be very satisfied with it."
positive,"not immoral: this book is surely one of the best. its meaning is crystal clear : in life better strong than weak. the fact is that the king doesn't steal food or money like those weak officers , he just buys low ans sells high. what clavell wants to say to us is that making money out of other people's stupidity is much better than being stupid."
negative,Wrong info: I thought the dvd was concert footage and it is still shots with music. I do love this album from Motorhead though.
positive,Review: I got what I expected in good quality. It is a good quality used book and there were no marks on the pages.
negative,"Too Academic: The book looks nice and reads easy.But the author obviously has little or no management experience at all. Reads like a mangement text book written by an outdated, behind-the-desk university professor.Recommended for folks who are keen on the history of strategic management!"
negative,"Nice briefcase, horrible customer service: I really liked this briefcase until one of the buckles broke. I contacted the company that shipped the bag, something like 'Sports Accessories', not Rawlings. After 3 months of poor communication (and after I sent them the broken buckle upon their request even though I had offered to just buy a new buckle) they informed me that their service department was closing. I asked them to return the broken buckle, but no response. The story is longer than this, but as a result of horrible customer service, I now have a briefcase that i cannot use."
negative,"WORST MOVIE EVER: OHHH, This is the best movie ever..< i wonder if guys who think that about ( dude where's my car ) ever seen any other movies ?? !!... i guess not..i won't tell the story of that movie like ppl here do..it's not even worthy to be told..i realy feel that that one star i'm giving this movie is too much for it, i'd give it -ve 5 stars .and guys who think dude where's my car is their best movie ever..please..try to watch some real movies"
positive,It's a Fit!: It's perfect. Purchased one that was supposed to be for a Prius but it didn't fit the way this one does. I'm so pleased I'm going to purchase the one that goes on the back now. Thanks.
positive,"Flair was at a minimum...: Wonderful movie... I LOVE this movie. However, truth must be told that the ""flair"" aspect is seriously lacking in this special edition. Which is a shame because let's face it there are a million things that would be done to ""flair"" it up from bottons, to post-its, to almost anything office related. It had special features like deleted scenes... but so many movies have that now that it really isn't all that special. I can't stress enough though that it's a great movie, I just wish the special edition was, well, more special..."

negative,"Promising premise, disappointing and remarkably dour delivery: Twain spoils a promising premise with bloated preachifying, colorless prose, and an uneven, nigh-absurdist plot arc."
positive,"''The era in which, music was ''GREAT'': I owned this film in VHS format, well some where along, I lost it. ''WELL now I have purchased it in CD format. This movie dispicts just how it was growing up for me in Spanish Harlem, where alot of the great musicians of that era where from. My old man being a musician hinself was a big influance in my love and passion for ''latin'' music, because of my father and being exposed to that great era, I too became an accomplished percusionist, I have been playing since I was 8 years old, still playing till this day, 59years of pure bliss. Okay back to the movie, in the scene in which Tito Puente is playing at the Palladium, and he calls up Armand Asante to come up and play, ''well that's Armand realy playing the timbales, he took lessons prior tp making the movie, he did a great job. Once you see this film, you would agree it's full of such wonderful music, when life was hard, but people played hard...This brings so many memories....love to all the people....."
negative,"Not even good enough to buy.: Finally I thought ""a sequel to Bad cat"" because I have dogs and cats. I always look at Amazon reviews before I buy a book but sometimes not on Amazon. Sorry Amazon!I went to Borders and looked at Bad dog. I was not happy. I do not like my daughter or me reading sex jokes about dogs and watching them pee or poopoo. Bad cat was easier on her eyes excet the word sh&t.;Perhaps teenagers wrote Bad dog in their bathroom at school. Too much toilet humor and just dogs in costumes or angry snarling at you. Misses the edge of Bad cat and not as clever. The jokes are not funny unless a dog on the beach saying ""oh I love the beach"" is funny.Other reviews here say this is great and fantastic. I wish they would share their pot with me so I could laugh at the jokes too 8(i did not buy the book and do not recommend unless you like poop or sex jokes.But 2 stars ** for taking the attempt and falling!**** Isadore *********************"
positive,"Bass - voice delight in jazz music: Miss Jordan always had a special attitude for the bass, the bass lines she uses to play with singing in a group. As much as Anita O'Day used to do whith drums, Sheila Jordan has the unique ability to express herself in a clear, witty and unique way, scatting or singin words, talking and exchanging suggestions with the acoustic bass player. This is the second, according to my knowledge, and probably one of the very best of her duo recordings. A must for jazz fans and listeners keen to jazz singers with an instrumental attitude."
positive,"Clear and to the point.: The best thing about this book is that it summarizes all the equations in boxes throughout the book. Therefore you don't have to hunt down the equations you need, unlike with many other statistics books. The book's explanations are clear and to the point, and therefore makes a great desk reference.The one sole downside to this text is its price. $90 is a bit steep for this small light weight volume."
positive,"Super Scary and Fascinating: Charles Manson is part of the American conscience, so I was of course aware of who he was when I began the story. My mom had told me that it was so scary when she tried to read it in college that she ran down the hall and threw the book in the bathroom trash! So I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.Bugliosi is a very good writer and exceptionally detail-oriented. The story begins with a bit of background on Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski and introducing the reader to the other people that were killed in the house that night. He also briefly covers the LaBiancas, the lesser known victims of that murderous spree. Once the crimes are committed, the story becomes more and more fascinating as the key players and their motives are introduced. It all seemed senseless before and it still seems senseless after reading Bugliosi's exhaustive account. Any true crime fan should definitely give this a read, the ultimate in true crime writing."
negative,"Extremely Poor Quality: I ordered this for my son's birthday, paid the 2 day delivery so it'd arrive in time. After seeing it in its package, I would never have bought this particular one at a store. I ordered it as new but it looks like someone has played with it and put it back in the package. The tip of the rocket is bent, the paint is scratched and smudged and has finger-like prints on it, it's just very poor quality. I expected a little better than what we got, realizing this was a $12 toy, but it should have been in better shape. I'm asking for a full refund, including shipping, as I think it's only fair since I still have to locate this rocket somewhere else and now only have 2 days to get it."
negative,Not a good NIGHT diaper...Son wakes up wet... ALWAYS: I use Pampers during the day and have to switch to Huggies for our night diaper...My son is 17 months and every other morning he wakes with a leaky diaper :o( Clothes soaked...bed soaked....I sent my last box back.
positive,"A Harry Richard essential cd!!!: Hi, I'm Harry Richard, and I'd like to say taht this cd is ESSENTIAL. If you are a fan of blues singer/jazz guitarist Aaron T-Bone Walker, you will love this late outing by the great legend. His guitar solos are amazing and improvised liek a true jazz player, yet with powerful from the gut blues feeling, liek a true blues rocker. This is a splendid outing by T-Bone with a fine backup group, and wonderful songs. Yes the album at times reflects teh sounds of teh period in which it was recorde, and these recordings are NOT his Imperial masterpieces, they are wonderfu land valid performances by a man who was not past his prime, but in his musical prime still . Generally exellent music, to be enjoyed by any trye T-Bone or blues or jazz guitar fan."
positive,"Pour yourself a cocktail and just relax: Filled with emotion, this tribute to the memory of Basie is the perfect way to relax after a long day. I also find the mellow ""vibe"" great background music for creative work."
negative,"DANGEROUS: This stick is extremely dangerous. I tried it to remove a small wart from the top of my foot, and it created a major chemical burn on the skin surrounding the wart. It is incredibly painful and now I'll probably need to have the wart surgically removed, which I was trying to avoid. I'd rate it NO stars if I could."
negative,"The most hopeless book I have ever read: I really don't know what kind of criteria this book met to receive as much acclamation over the years as it has, it is the absolute worst book I've ever read. Pessimistic, cynical, jaded and completely blind to the truth of the human condition, Golding uses this book as an opportunity to highlight the worst part of the human condition. Golding's message that mankind is imprisoned by civilization, and once we are freed from it we will return to ""savage"" roots is baseless and nihilistic. Save yourself the agravation and do not read this book. If you are looking for a cautionary tale of some sort, read 1984 by George Orwell or anything other than this insulting piece of overrated literature."
negative,"Not really worth your time: I'm a big fan of the car chase/road trip cult films from the 1970's, so I thought this film would be worth checking out. I wasn't expecting anything Oscar-worthy or mind-blowing from the script, the dialogue or the plotline, but I was hoping for some decent car chases and/or crashes. I got neither. 'Cannonball Run II' was more enjoyable than this, and HB Halicki's films had better acting and dialogue than this puppy did.It's only worth seeing to cross off the list. I highly doubt anybody would go back for a second viewing. I sure won't."
negative,Another computer generated teen brain flick: The computer generated flying scenes are so unreal that us real pilots can't watch this thing....You can not fly next to each other and yell back and forth between aircraft... They had hand signals for that... the story line is far from historical... I guess is Ok as a highschool date movie...
positive,"Wicked sense of humour!: Bjork's vibrant music may be a bit of a shock for first-time listeners. Hang in there. You can't help but be carried away by her raw, fresh vocals and strident rhythms! I would recommend this CD (and all her music) to anyone. Whether she's hypnotizing us with whispers or gracing us with her mighty bellow, Bjork's music is unabashedly a good time."
positive,"Is Germany the Future Sound of now?: Once again the Compost crew devestate with this collection that is sure to please those who refuse to be pigeonholed. With sounds running the spectrum from jazzual house to brokenbeat experimentation. Definately one for the repeat button. Sureshot selections include tracks by super inovator Phil Asher with his Restless Soul project, Austrian beatmeister Earthbound and footstomping mayhem from Japans U.F.O exclusive unreleased tracks! If you fancy yourself a conniseur of the outernational jazz dance scene then this is the soundtrack for you! Kinda like an audio edition of Wallpaper magazine if you can catch the vibe."
negative,"Bought Product, Not Yet In Charge of World: I am an evil scientist and as such wish very badly to rule the world. I bought this product, in fact I bought 3 of this product, in the hopes that it would help, but as you may have noticed I am not your overlord. If the half-pound of Plutonium I have recently ordered does not make the governments cower in fear then I'll probably give up and try to become a grain farmer."
negative,"2 stars for Jennifer!: Ya know, with Will Ferrell and Jennifer Love Hewitt in this movie, I thought it would be an awesome movie...Well, I can't always be right. The one part I did like in the movie was when Jennifer Love Hewitt showed one of her tattooes to a band member's wife... (requiring her to lift up her dress, catching a peak at her undies) :D Nice..."
negative,"Dull...: The story of a woman that does not know what she wants. Boring, decidedly too long and with a detestable, foolish heroine. Why did Eliot wish to torture her readers?"
positive,"Titanium is a good thing: Well, I have to say I was so excited to see my new hammer show up. I looked forward to using it the very next day. It is such a great change to go from a 22 ounce framer to one that is so much lighter and well balanced. I have used many different hammers and this one ranks right close to the top. The only downfall I noticed was that concrete cut nails take the face down quite fast, even though I did't drive many. Overall it is a great hammer to have in your hand all day."
negative,"Sucked: I am sorry, but this film was as creative as a pile of toothpaste on a sidewalk on a hot summer day in Phoenix. The active was sub par and the animation was done by interns.The highlight of the film as the bus that was heading for Sunset BLVD.Please, for the love of God, don't let your kids watch this film."
negative,"Ok for the price: This ring is ok for the price. Very light weight, band is very thin. Actually bent band by just taking off. Ok to wear to add a little bling. Wish it was better quality - I know, you get what you pay for. Looks like my 7 yr old niece is getting a new ring."
positive,"album of the year: Most people who didnt' like this album where expecting a Soundgarden album. Which this is not, this album in my opinion is a natural progression in maturity for Cornell. He proves that he is and always was much more than the sum of all the past Soundgarden albums. With emotionally powerful songs like: Follow My Way, When I'm Down, and Wave Goodbye Euphoria Morning is nothing like and much more than Cornell's past work and is in my opinon a must have. There is nothing else in popular music today at this level."
positive,"Fresh take on an old plot: I really liked this film. It combines musical film with 1950's mystery. It's a fresh take on an old plot. It was also cool to see so many great French actresses in the same movie. Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, and Fanny Ardant steal the show, but all eight actresses turned in a nearly flawless performance. There are a lot of family secrets revealed along the way and the intricacies of the characters are played well. The ending is typically European but not an unfamiliar device to American theatre patrons."
positive,One hundred years of solitude: I received confirmation that the book had been shipped and it arrived as confirmed. The book was in great shape and the price was exceptional.
negative,"Or, if you want good swing...: Then check out Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. I picked this up because of Zoot Suit Riot. The vocals are weak and somewhat whiny and the lyrics are lame. The only thing saving this disaster disc from the lowest rating is the music. This band can play! Unfortunately, I just can't get past the vocals and lyrics to listen to it and enjoy the instruments. If you want a cheap copy of this, check the shoulder off of I-405, that's where I've tossed mine. Seriously, for the complete package, do yourself a favor and check out BBVD!"
positive,"A Very Moving Story: This is the true story of one idealistic young Polish American Priest who snuck into Russia at the start of World War II and ended up spending most of his adult life in the Gulags in Siberia as a ""political prissioner"""
negative,size wrong: The size is wrong. I ordered my regular size and it's much too small. Am returning for a larger. We'll see.
positive,Happy Customer w/ Happy Hooker: This book was so informative that I gave my copy to my sister in Florida and had to purchase another one for myself (in California).
positive,"A great deal for razors.: I have been doing the subscribe and save on this item for a year. It's o good deal, and it saves me A trip to Costco or Walmart, to buy it."
negative,"Slow, Boring, and Depressing: I was depressed for a week after I finished completing this novel. The torture that the protagonist endures is just too much to digest. I can only be thankful that this terrifying vision hasn't come to fruition...yet.Oddly enough, as I was trying to finish the final 100 pages of this book, I began reading ""The Partner"", which also has the main character endure series of torture to get him to crack."
positive,"Showdown in Little Tokyo: Talk about a culture-clash. A white American male raised in the samurai ways in Japan, and an adopted Japanese-American male trained in the Californian ways are matched up in the LAPD to bring down the source of a new and deadly drug. Forced to work together,Chris Kenner teaches Johnny Murata about the heritage he scoffs at while Johnny offers quirky remarks and comic timing. Chris soon realizes that the man who killed his parents is the man spreading the killer drug, and both set out on revenge."
positive,My winter time fav!: Love this spray- it's great to use especially for the areas of your back you can't seem to reach.
positive,THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME: I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME BECAUSE IT KEPT ME WANTING TO READ IT MORE AND MORE. I HAD A HARD TIME PUTTING THE BOOK DOWN. IT SEEM TO HAVE TRUE TO FACT KNOWLEDGE OF THE OLD PIONEER DAYS. THE CHARACTERS WERE GREAT.
negative,This book was really odd..........: This book was a hard read because I didn't find it interesting. It was really strange to me. I was required to read it for my English class. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because I personally did not enjoy it. I was confused as to what went on the entire way through.
negative,Poor manufacturing makes for a lousy toy.: This building set is a poor quality knock off of the Lincoln Log brand. It is poorly machined and the pieces do not fit together. Pieces are irregular in shape and quality. I am returning the set we bought.
positive,"Satisfied: Perfect size for my morning latte or cappuccino. I fill it 2/3 full to leave room for a little foam before I transfer the liquid to my 16 oz. travel mug. It pours cleanly from the spout. Stainless steel pitcher can get quite hot to the touch from steaming, obviously, but the handle never does."
negative,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS STUPID MACHINE: I have three package of this products and I have a studio apartment.I put all three of them in my small apartment.GUESS WHAT HAPPENED?AFTER 10-14DAYS?THE MOUSE CAME and it seemed that the Machines didn't work at all.I wish I could Return this.. since I bought it from one of the local hardware store.they wouldn't let me return.anyway it sucks don't buy it.my first time comments here in my life cuz I am so mad for this machineplus, it has 'tik tik....' annoying sounds when you plug in."
positive,"jonestown: Wow. this movie is definitely one that should be watched. so sad. so many people deceived.""Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.Ye shall know them by their fruits."" Matthew 7:15-16"
positive,"Good for the price: I have had mine for a month now and have to say I have enjoyed it. The Pros:Price! Almost half what an ipod would cost you! I don't care how it looks and I always drive so the size is not important to me.Sound quality is wonderful, I really like the smart volume sound normalization. Yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway. I quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song/playlist etc fast enough. I also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!Cons. Creative software stinks. It's horrible. redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more! The front cover can pop off easily but I always have mine in the case so I didn't notice after first day."
positive,"Works Great: I installed this card in my computer running windows 7 64 bit. Had to connect to internet with wired connection to let windows search for driver. Within a minute it found the correct driver for windows 7, installed it and it immediately found my wi-fi connection. Just had to enter my passwoord and everything is working great."
positive,"Great read: I discovered this book when I lived in London about ten years ago and always end up re-reading it around Thanksgiving of every year. It's the story of 6 friends who rent a beach house as an indulgent year between college graduation and facing the ""real world."" When one of their number discovers he has terminal cancer, it forces the others to face up to their futures and their lives with each other and without one of their own. A brilliant book that I highly recommend!"
negative,"NOT so good: Not a very good book to learn Java. I found that the book doesn't organized very well, and you will still get confused if you are a beginner even after you read the book throughly."
positive,"Laugh out loud funny: I thought this movie was hilarious. The two main characters Val and Earl were the best part. Everytime they tried to leave Perfection, something would stop them. ""We just waited one day too long to leave""The 'Graboids' are voracious eaters who travel through dirt like fish through water. They sense vibrations caused by those walking on top, reminiscent of the giant worms from Dune. They then come to the surface and have a snack.Great movie. Not really scary, no sex or profanity. Good for the whole family."
negative,nothing new and not a lot of meat: There isn't anything new to be found in this text that hasn't been covered more thoroughly in other texts. The topics covered seemed glossed over without any meat or substance. Skip this one for more up to date books.
negative,"Worst Book I have ever read: This is like my first try at writing - over-used plot, short chapters, small vocabulary, typical charachters. This book shows no writing skills whatsoever. Look at its title. ""Jim the Boy"". Very original.Yet the dialogues freaked me out the most:""..."" Jim said""..."" Uncle Coran said""..."" said Jim""..."" Uncle Zeno said.The word ""said"" probably has the greatest number of synonyms, but Earley never used any other word.The plot is an ""oh so sweet"" typical plot that I have seen so many times. Nothing special. No twists to it. A plain, dull, stupid plot. Just another boy without a parent during Depression.I can't even say much about this book, because there's NOTHING in it. If I didn't have to read this book for my school, I would never have read it beyong the 20th page."
negative,"great idea..horrible story: I really like Mr. King. I have read nearly all his books, and devoured them all. But for some reason, this story just doesn't get off the ground. It has a great story idea, but no real direction and no real plot. I found myself dragging myself through the pages in hopes that it would get better. I have to say that I was extremely dissappointed in the story. Sorry horror fans, but this was a flop"
positive,Love Scarpetta: You have to love the Scarpetta series by Cornwell. This is an excellent story full of suspense and humor.
negative,"shockingly bad: i would never have imagined in a million years with all the supposed tlc focused on this flick, that it could have been this poor. it's outrageously bad. the plot...wait what plot? when you see ninjas jumping around closing ranks on bruce, and if you don't fall asleep after the first hour or so...you'll get to 'enjoy' the same disjointed plotless cra#$est that i unfortunately paid to see.AVOID"
negative,"A disappointing reunion album...: Because of the fanatical loyalty of their fans, KISS has magaged to remian popular all these years despite their devolving musicianship. I used to be one of their greatest fans, but ""Psycho Circus"" is nothing compared their earlier work. I believe this album is nothing more than a huge cash cow. KISS was an inspiration for an entire generation of great rock bands, but those days are gone, and ""Psycho Circus"" proves it. Ace and his old band is the only hope KISS fans have. I hope he gets back with them soon..."
positive,unashamed: This was the first Christian CD I ever bought that I wasn't afraid to role down the window in my car and crank up the volume.
negative,"Not worth the $2 rental: Ok, might be worth it to learn how not to make a training video. Gary spends the whole 60 minutes in front of a green screen used as a backdrop for the whole show, talking to the camera. He does spend 15 minutes or so setting up a steadicam, dropping the monitor half way through (comical value). That's about the only practical demonstration he does. The video suffers from lack of use of the very media it's trying to teach."
negative,"what a joke!: I don't know if I got a bad one, but I bought this one at best buy, and was literally a last minute thing, and was probably the worst last minute decision in my life. I am a gamer, and this thing will drop the connection and literally is useless. I've been wondering if it's my computer or the usb wireless. After reading alot of the bad reviews on here about this item, it's definitely the usb wireless's fault. because I under the frustration from this wireless adapter, I guess it's time to upgrade. BTW I did a speedtest and my 5 year old laptop gets a better connection than this lol."
negative,"Polished chrome is too yellow: This is not a review of the quality of the product. The quality is very good. It just that polished chrome rod is more like polished nickel, too yellow, even though the bollard anchors are true polished chrome. So they do not match! I would not buy this item again nor recommend it."
negative,"One of the worst movies ever?: ...I think so. Horrible acting, horrible stuntwork, bad camera work and a ripped-off script. Kurt Thomas was a fine gymnast, but he can't even fake a fight scene, and he deffinately can't act."
negative,"Old Version Still Being Shipped: I ordered Gladiator this week hoping for the new version per other discussions & reviews. Unfortunately, Amazon is still sending out the old version at least in my case. I called Paramount Home Entertainment (888-889-9456) and they verified my copy I rec'd on Aug. 10 was the old version. They also indicated the old version had been pulled & discontinued. Verification was done by asking two questions: 1) What was the color of the UPC label, yellow not white is the new version, and 2) What is the ID number on the back side of Disc 1 near the center. I had to use a magnifying glass to read it beginning with the letters ""NA"" and ending with ""R1"" for the old version or ""R2"" for the new. They instructed me to send disc 1 only to them with my name, address & phone for a replacement set."
positive,Great to read this classic: First read this book over 50 years ago. It was more interesting this time and worth the time to revisit. Just watched the movie on Netflix and couldn't help comparing the two.
negative,"a disappointment: I heard so much about this book but it has so little. Pseudo-intellectual language, undeveloped characters, a few nice parts. Not at all what I expected, and not particularly sexy."
positive,Best matinee movie of the year!: I thoroughly enjoyed this movie mainly because it pretends to be anything but serious.It has eveything from action to romance to superstitious curses and creepy crawly insects.You'll love it.If Spielberg ever needs a succcessor for Indiana Jones he should look no further than Brendan Fraser.I would hesitate however about showing the kids but the grown ups will not be bored.Looking forward to the sequel...
negative,"B Movie: It really scares me that so many people thought this movie was funny. If your IQ is over 80, don't waste your time."
negative,"A movie that tries too hard to be funny, and falls flat.: Dodgball has the formula to be a classic. What can be funnier than seeing a bunch of people get pelted with red rubber balls? But somewhere during execution, the film lost whatever magic it may have had. Ben Stiller's character is like a lame version of Zoolander, that tries to be funny, but fails horribly. Vince Vaughn is also not funny and not a likeable character along with his crew of strange outcasts of life. When they got Ben and Vince against each other, I could care less who won.Simple movie goers may like this film, but people looking for a comedy that's more than just stupid one liners (that aren't even good.) Dodgeball does not deliver. When I went to see this movie I expected nothing from it, and I got less. I'm only giving this 2 stars because of a few cheap laughs it had that actualy were successful, other than that, it was a complete failure. One of the worst movies of 2004."
negative,"A great idea!: Hey gang, let's pool our resources and get the rights so Mystery Science Theater can talk us through this one!I'm telling you it would surpass even Manos, Hands of Fate for sheer yuks. The cheese, the schmatz, the dishonesty, the cluelessness, the pretention of this flick just begs, begs to be put out of its misery."
positive,"Amazing, Fascinating: This was a stunning book. Well written, packed with fascinating detail, I wish I had ten more like it to turn to. Anyone looking for an inside view of a part of China's history would do well to pick up this book. It was a wonderful read."
negative,"lead is wrong: Solid cast, with the exception of the lead. Rooker from the first one should have been back, as well as the original director and writer: John McNaughton and Richard Fire, respectively.This director here doesn't seem to get suspense--and it hurt the film. There is just no beating the original. Too bad McNaughton and the rest from the first flick did not come back for an encore--because now, even if they did, it might be way too late.It's kind of sad, because McNaughton might have had a far bigger/impressive film career if he had.Skip this one. See the original (20 year anni issue, etc.). It will give you chills."
negative,Awful: This is the first and the last book of Harry Turtledove that I wil read....awful....stupid....not at all what I expected in the least.....not good at all....very dissapointing......:(
positive,"Evita soundtrack: I was impressed with speed of delivery, condition of product & quality of packaging for the product.The soundtrack itself is wonderful as I saw the original movie when it came out and feel Madonna & Antonio deserved a better review than they got for their performances."
negative,"Don't get your hopes up: I found this product at Target for around $50. I was so excited to buy it after seeing the commercial! I thought it was going to the answer to all my hair problems! Well, sorry.... nope. I'm not saying it was awful... but it took me a LOT longer than my usual routine which is quickly blow drying my hair and then going over it with a big-barrel curling iron. So it took longer, and my hair wasn't that smooth. Then I went outside and it immediately got wavy and frizzy. LUCKILY, I had asked the lady at Target when I bought it if I could return it if I didn't like it, and she said I could. So, back to the store it goes tomorrow!"
negative,"Just a wanna be Rambo: If you are looking for a movie with bad acting-cliche lines-and never gonna happen action sequences this is the movie for you! Otherwise, I wouldn't even waste a Netflix rental on it."
positive,"Ella Rocks!: It was the reviews on Amazon that encouraged me to buy this CD and I'm forever greatful. The more I listen to it, the more contemporary it feels. The singing is inspired and the arrangements don't just swing, they rock! Of course Ella had a habit of making everything sound easy but it really does feel as if she's having a great time. I was unfamiliar with most of the songs on this CD so half the pleasure is in getting to know them - they're simply aren't any duds. Great stuff."
negative,"Terrible Picture: As other reviewers explain technically, the picture quality on this release is horrendous for bluray. Do not buy."
negative,"Oh, puhleeeeaze!: I wouldn't have stuck with this improbably (even for fantasy) tale much beyond the parts where Ayla: 1) invents shampoo and 2)discovers fire, but I was in that proverbial ""desert island"" situation (it happens!). I guess you have to be into sci fi set in the stone age."
positive,"Fun Premise: The premise makes up for less-than-stellar performances. The plot can feel a little tedious through the second third of the film, but it pays off to keep watching."
positive,So fun: I think this game is harder and more fun than chess. Definitely great for anyone who is willing to learn how to play!
positive,"If you loved ""Les Miserables"" you'll love this too: This book was a gift to me from my sister, and I must say it was one of the best gifts I could have received. Having recently read 'Les Miserables' (the book is so much better than a movie or play) I was primed for The Count. The stories are so similar; two men who escape prison and begin a journey towards enlightenment and salvation. The only difference being that Jean Valjean was a true criminal who redeems himself through selfless philanthropy while Edmund Dante (the Count) is a wrongly convicted man who uses his wealth for revenge. Yet both of these stories ultimately have identical moral themes.Classics such as these transcend time, and for good reason. You will not be able to put it down once you start reading it; it will give you a profound sense of humanity when you put it down, and will keep you thinking well after you have finished it."
negative,"Superb book, bad edition: Godfrey Lienhardt's Divinity and Experience is a classic and sensitive ethnography of Dinka religious life. This 2003 paperbook reprint by Clarendon (Oxford University Press), however, does a great disservice to Lienhardt by eliminating the plates that were present in previous editions! Plus, the $95 list price is borderline criminal. I would give this edition zero stars for omitting the plates and the exorbitant price, but out of respect for Linhardt's magnificent work, I am giving a rating of two stars in order to spare him the indignity of a lowest possible rating. Do yourselves a favor and buy a cheap used copy of this edition or pay the few extra dollars for an earlier edition that includes the plates."
positive,"Wow! Wow! Wow!: Yessssssssss! (Stars in eyes) this movie ROCKS! ROCKS! ROCKS! Everything's complete perfection: Acting, Story, Cast, Screeplay, EVERYTHING! You name it!!! If you are looking for a movie with everything in it...""Gladiator"" is your movie! Russell Crowe is so hunky. And a great actor. When it first came out, you can guess that I didn't waste ONE SECOND to go to the store and buy it! I just had to have it! I want you guys to watch this movie, because, man, I repeat, ""Gladiator"" ROCKS!!!!"
negative,"Hyped Stock Fantasy -- BEWWARE!: Just read the whole book and wished that I had not. What a waste of my time. I kept thinking it would get better but it sadly never did. There are so much better fantasy books than this to pick up (I suggest the LOTR or Harry Potter, perhaps Narnia) that this is just the stockest fantasy story I have ever read. Every scene and dialogue is a cliche! BARF!"
positive,"Singin' with Emmylou"" CD Vol 1: She has her own career and many beautiful cds, but she has also done some wonderful background work and gorgeous duets as well! Many of those are highlighted here! work with artists like George Jones, Kathy Mattea, Trisha Yearwood, the late Dan Fogelberg, Pure Prairie League,,just to name a few! Their is already a Vol 2 out,,,how long do we have to wait for Vol 3 Emmy? Don't make us beg!! LOLAnyway, the CD was in great shape, came quickly and played beautifully! Kudos to the seller and to Emmylou! =)"
positive,Simple: This is simple to use if your cartriges fit it and very economical for ink replacement. This WILL NOT work with HP 901.
negative,"Is There A Plot Here?!: I had to read this book for my English class at school and I started out with an optimistic attitude reflecting this book. The beginning of the book was rather slow but, of course, I had to read it and was willing to give it a chance on account of it being such an essential classic. As I read further, though, I feel that the book could have develloped further than it did. What had been a trace of a plot at the beginning of the book had all but shrunken into a totally unnecessary conclusion that, I feel, had no thought or reflection on the main goal of the book."
negative,"Absolutely terrible..: Now, first I read the book, a masterpiece of Brtitsh author Anthony Burgess, who creasted the slang featured in the film -- not Stanley Kubrick...-- and, as usual, the movie disappointed me. I generally don't like Kubrick, as he seems pretentious as all heavens, so I can say that this one is probably among the least-bad out of his ""classic"" era. There are several things he completely [messed]-up, creating a film of psychedellic eye-candy that seems to ""glorify"" the violent nature of the book, and he makes the lead into an even purer [jerk] than he was in the book, where he seemed to have a bit of sympathy for his mates, amongst other things. If you're a fan of violence, psychedellic films, pseudo-surrealism, and / or Stanley Kubrick, you'll probably enjoy this little endeavor from the Bronx's best-loved hack. If you're a fan of Anthony Burgess and / or real artists, you probably won't enjoy it at all -- I know I didn't."
positive,"yessssssss: all the colours in this box worked! i've never had that happen before lol. all the colours are very pretty. I am pretty pleased with the row of greyscale too. the gold and silver markers are awesome, and i've found them useful in decorating plain bags and accenting scrapbook paper.i am 100% pleased with these markers. :>"
negative,"Awfully Bad: Transformers: The Movie was disappointing. I was in high school when they came out in the early '80s. Hey, I love cartoons. But in '86, the Transformers started to change in the series, and it continued in the movie.Unless you love everything about the Transformers don't see this movie. If you love the cartoon before Optimus Prime dies, don't see this movie.I gave it two stars, because unlike the other reviewers, I saw it in the theatre when it came out in the summer of '86. The price was worth it to see the cartoon in a wide screen and with the dolby-enhanced sound."
positive,"Chi Running book: Helps to prevent running injuries. Unfortunately, I thought it was a CD/DVD, as I don't purchase ""books"" any longer, with my Kindle I download them and would have this item or not purchased it at all..."
positive,"Wow.: She has never sounded better. I'd been awaiting this album, though I wasn't in love with either of her previous solo albums. But I caught her vh1 soul ""Listening Party"" and I have to say after hearing how Amel speaks about music, I feel her soul was captured on Morning. The arrangements are fresh, her voice doesn't get lost or overpower the music, the lyrics are thoughtful and elegant. Oh her voice is such a gift. It's all uplifting.And the album is perfectly titled - something to wake up to and carry with you throughout your day."
negative,Hope you have better luck: I am a stay at home mother and I was really excited to see this product when it came out. I thought that this would have something for both my boys. To my surprise neither one of them was to thrilled with this climber/swing set. The swings are used rarely and I've hardly seen them use the climber. The whole thing is very sun faded after only a year and the platforms for the slides are kinda flimsy. Honestly I expected more from Little Tikes. We have some great toys from that company but this one didn't work out for our family.
positive,"Just not up to snuff compared with her previous books: Just not up to snuff compared with her previous books is what I found.I imagine it was hard for her to get back into the rhythm of writing after such a hiatus. While I enjoyed this 5th novel, I much preferred the first 4 as they seemed to flow one into the other."
positive,"I loved it.: I loved this book. The picture Jean Auel paints is of an ancient world in a time of change. She makes the characters real, you can sense and identify with their emotions. Hurry with that next book"
positive,"A superb guide for any traveler seeking to visit and pay his respects to these hallowed burial grounds: Now in its third newly revised edition, Arlington National Cemetery is a thorough guide to America's shrine upholding the highest respect in memory of the astronauts, actors, writers, and Supreme Court justices among its 300,000 honored dead. Chapters discuss Arlington's history up to the present day, the American patriots and noted heroes buried there, major monuments and memorials including living memorials (a.k.a. tree dedications), and a handy visitor's guide. Appendices and an index round out this superb guide for any traveler seeking to visit and pay his respects to these hallowed burial grounds."
positive,A MAGNIFICENT CHICK FLICK.: Hugh Jackman is magnificent. Very handsome and irresistable. Someone like you is a movie about a woman named Jane (Judd) who thought she had figured out what was wrong with men until she met Mr. Right. Very predictable and cute movie. A MAGNIFICENT CHICK FLICK.
positive,"Doolittle is Doing a LOT!: First time ever reviewing for Amazon, although I've bought plenty. Why bother? Because Jerome Doolittle's Body Scissor's is worth the read and the write. If you enjoy Crais, Parker et al, you will enjoy Jerome's style as well. Tom Bethany is just the guy I'd like to be--if I were a guy. :-) Read his earlier works- grow with his characters."
positive,"Yesteryear: I have read this book several times since it was first published and find it enjoyable each time I read it. The chacarters he builds in this book are great. It's a book to read when you wish to lay back and dream about how good ""US"" humans are .......and how fanatical some of ""US"" can be. If you enjoy Mr. Hogans books you will greatly enjoy this good story. I have read all of Mr. Hogan's books and enjoy them all. I can't wait to see where his next story will take me."
negative,"Pick a writing style: I am currently reading the classics, I feel they are classics for a reason. Ulysses though was one of the most difficult books I've ever attempted. I forced myself to keep going. It didn't flow and was difficult to read because the writer kept changing styles.I just don't think it's worth reading and wish I hadn't bothered. I understood the book but just didn't enjoy it. If you get halfway through and can't decide whether to keep going, it doesn't get better. Granted, it's an intellectual book, I now know I am not to be described as an intellectual."
positive,"Monster memories: Good Copy of orginal score.The Wolfman is the stronger of the tracks here though Son of Frankenstein is not in the same class as the music from The Bride of Frankenstein is still invokes great moments from the movie.Great for collectors even if they are not horror fans.The Wolfman tracks from the film are the first to be recorded and also includes music that was wrote but never used in the finished movie.Listening to the music from the DVD realeases of the films, you would find it hard pressed to tell the difference if any."
positive,"Excellent DVD for Beginners to Advanced Kettlebell Users: Being a retired bodybuilder, I never thought that training for only 20 minutes could result in extraordinary results. I was used too spending hours lifting weights and doing cardio. I was skeptical in the beginning when starting exercising with kettlebells until I saw my body transform. I bought Kettlebell Bombshell DVD to get different kettlebell workouts. This DVD shocked me! Amazing instruction and well-paced exercises to take you to the limits of kettlebell training. I drain with sweat and still can only do one workout per day. Lisa is an amazing instructor and role model. She is always available if you have questions. How many DVD exercise instructors offer that kind of support? Lisa is definitely a ""bombshell"". I highly recommend this DVD!"
positive,"The hobbit: Good read, kind of wordy at times but that is Tolkien 's style. I would have liked it to be more well rounded at the end but still, not bad"
positive,"Just like the one that came with the camera: Just like the one that came with the camera, works perfectly and fit the battery it says it will. Awesome."
negative,"Disavowed by Cartier-Bresson: Those of you who would buy this book because you are fans of the subject should know that Mr. Cartier-Bresson has done everything he could to prevent this book from being published. It is against his wishes, and Mr. Duncan's decision to go ahead and publish it has effectively ended their (formerly friendly) relationship.It's a silly idea to begin with. Out of an entire roll of film, even of a master like Cartier-Bresson, how many images are publishable and how many are forgettable?This is a sad exercise by Mr. Duncan to cash in on the famed reclusiveness of his subject."
negative,"Last Days should be called Last Time: Because the first time you watch it will undoubtly be your last as well. Overall I believed I was going to be watching a movie loosely based on the life of Kurt Cobain leading up to his death.Instead what I was ""graced"" with is Blake (Kurt) sitting in a creek, sitting by the lake, sitting against a door and so on and so on. Half the time you're just looking at a still object with no characters on screen. There was a plot somewhere in there too but with all the MUMBLING you might miss it. Not to mention that there isn't that much dialogue to begin with.I wouldn't recommend this movie to Nirvana/Kurt Cobain fans.This movie bored me tears, I barely finished it."
positive,"Slow start, but finishes strong: I must admit that part of my interest in this book is provincial, as I spent part of my growing years in Louisiana, where the name of Huey P. Long is still familiar. Robert Penn Warren's novel starts off a little slowly, but the action picks up, and Willie Stark is a finely drawn character whose resemblance to the real life Long will not be overlooked by those familiar with Louisiana's political history in this century. Warren captures the FLAVOR of Huey Long's political milieau with his portrait of Willie Stark. This book is surely worth a look if you are interested in seeing the potential benefits and dangers of someone who demanded absolute power to operate in the political sphere."
positive,"The Mummy Returns: This movie is ""AWESOME"" Stephen Somers is a great director in this film. This movie is better than the first one,ithas more twists and turns action to this movie. You should see this movie, and it's a great one, to your DVD collection. It's a very fast paced action-adventure horror film."
negative,"Lacks style.: While I know Brokaw is a newsman and journalist, too much of his linear style effects what are otherwise compelling stories of those who lived and fought for this country."
negative,"If you liked the book, get Stuart 2 and skip this: Shyamalan rewrote the classic children's book by E.B. White, one the most respected and beloved authors in the English language. And in EBWHite's book, Stuart is NOT an orphan. He is happy and adventurous, and in his travels he charms everyone he meets with his friendly cheerful attitude and his concern for his friends. Shyamalan throws away the entire plot and recasts Stuart as a mopey little rodent looking for his real parents. Also, the book has lots of lively action for the kids while slipping in little verbal absurdities for the adult reader. Shyamalan's dark and lifeless version loses both. Get SL2, which is closer the original book."
negative,"Eh, I'm not impressed: As an atheist, I thought that maybe reading ""Mere Christianity"" would give me some insight into why intelligent Christians can believe what they do. Unfortunately, it did not. The book's logic is often (usually!) shoddy and I learned more by visiting a church one day and speaking to the pastor for 15 minutes than from reading this entire book.I don't know, I didn't care for this book. It is well written in an easy to read fashion, but don't let that fool you: behind its pretty exterior lies a whole lot of gobbledy-gook and nonsense. If you want intelligent Christian thought, go talk to an educated member of the clergy because you won't find it here."
negative,Very flimsy....: We ordered the item twice because first time it came broken. But second time also was the same result. You may like it if the set comes in one piece.
negative,"Just plain sucked: No other way to put it. Van Zandt and his crew came off like a bunch of no talent, Bohemian Pre-Madonnas. A venture into artistic self indulgence. One of the worst movies, if not the worst movie I have ever seen. I want my 90 minutes back. You can keep the money."
negative,"Save your money! You can find much better!: I was very disappointed in the quality and supposed insight in this book! All it is a collection of some poems from Mt. Berkowitz. Although the poems are good, there is no good reason to pay [amt] for them. It seems there is a definite attempt to discredit all that Mr. Berkowitz is doing now to make up for all the pain he has caused. It has been almost 25 years since this crime took place and if I am going to spend my money on a book about Mr. Berkowitz I would expect it to be more worthwhile. It seems the writer has a vendetta or something against Mr. Berkowitz. I found much better info on Mr. Berkowitz on his own personal website.... They have there his daily journal which is much more interesting to read than this book! I would give it ZERO STARS if possible!"
positive,"Burn: I recently got my braces removed and decided to whiten my teeth. During my previous experiences with the strips i experienced no burning, but after i got my braces off, i experienced an unbearable burning. Im sticking through it, but when i take them off...my gums turn white where the strips were. i don't know if this is bad or what, if anyone could tell me i'd like to know. But when i did use them before i had braces, the effects were incredible. they really work"
negative,"Do NOT buy this DVD!!: The quality of this DVD is TERRIBLE! It skips and not the disk but the actual movie skips. The color is bad, the contrast is awful and the original sound effects are missing. Now if you really don't care about that (really?) buy it, it's only 9.95, no huge loss, but good lord it's terrible quality."
positive,"Sweet and all around Good Natured Fun: I thought this movie was very sweet. It was some what predictable but I enjoyed it anyway because it was jut too sweet to pass up and sometimes you don't want a movie you have to think about or anything too heavy, this is perfect!Drew Barrymore's character, Lucy, has no short-term memory, so Adam Sandler's character, Henry, has to treat every encounter as their first. With the help of Lucy's friends, father and brother (played Sean Austin - Samwise) Henry and Lucy's relationship gets to blossom, everyday!It's just so sweet how far Henry will go to remind her that she loves him. Awwww...."
positive,"All Nicolas Cage: He is such a good actor that he can take this ""plot"" and make a good movie out of it."
negative,"*YAWN*: This book COULD have been really great...but Klare feels the need to repeat and reemphasize something you just read in the last 4 chapters AGAIN. YES, it had some good information...but the absolute monotony and repetion detracted from the book, and I actually wanted to learn more than three or four main ideas that could have been summarized in ten pages or less...one of the biggest wastes of time in my entire life."
negative,"Catastrophe Cave!: The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son's birthday. It was a complete waste of money! The toy design is terrible! The batcave falls over when played with. The elevator doesn't function properly either. Because of all the malfunctions and collapes, my son lost interest within five minutes of play. If you want your child to have a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas go with something other than this toy."
positive,"Very Readable: Livingston does a masterful job of summarizing Christian thought in the west from Kant through Nietzsche. Each theologian is well summarized and located within the various movements of Christian thought. Many of today's religious issues have their antecedents in the 19th century: individual autonomy vs group solidarity, reason vs tradition, and the objective vs subjective aspects of reality."
positive,"Insightful memoir: It was interesting to see the parallels between Duras' life and the life of the narrator. The style (nouveau roman) might be difficult for some readers to follow, but the recalling of memories comes across as bittersweet and ultimately painful...makes for an interesting study."
positive,"awesome: this product is awesome and my son loves it, he never takes it off, he has gotten headbands before but none with this durabilty and quality."
positive,"Beautifully written: Tolkien writes beautifully, we all know that. This book, of course, is no exception. A warning to those who read to their children, the sentence structures are sometimes convoluted and extensive causing a need to read them to yourself before reading them to children. The sentences sometimes ramble and lose their thread when read aloud if you are not fully aware. That being said, my kids loved this book, loved the adventure and the beauty of the imagined surroundings. Highly recommend."
negative,"Seriously Boring: Very unorganized, I couldn't even find a single myth in here by page 30. This is so not worth it."
positive,"Possibly the best Joke Book ever: Although a number of your friends may think you a bit weird if you tried to retell them. This rates as one of the few books that makes me laugh out loud (very loudly). A collection of explanations of strange & bizarre place names from around the world, Mr Adams and Mr Lloyd truly show off their incredibly imaginations and pure wit. While the reader may need a ""Monty Pythonish"" (or even a Hitch-Hikers Guide!) sense of humour, this is a genuinely very funny book"
positive,Brilliantly Dickens: To really appreciate the story that most of us know- and to enjoy a story that is truly a masterpiece The Christmas Carol is a must read.
negative,"Average Shirts: Shirts of average quality...worth about what I paid for them, $10.00.....built in collar stays..."
negative,"We're dissapointed...: My kids (age3, boy & girl) love ''KIDS FAVORITE SONGS'' video . So I purhased this video for them. We do not want to watch an interview program! I want to give my kids song video. I had been deceived by that title."
negative,"Glad it's Over: 12 years of anticipation; 3 days of disappointment. Out of 750 pages, about 300 of them may have contained new material, and as others here have noted, even that was less than compelling. However, I wasn't crazy about The Valley of the Horses, either. I skipped almost all the chapters with Jon and Thon (and was thankful that it was split up like that so that I could easily bypass those parts) and was also bored with large sections of Plains of Passage. I appreciate how much research went into Auel's descriptions of flint tool making and of the flora and fauna of the epoch, but honestly... enough already.I think at this point, I'd like to see Ayla assert her otherwordly power and really freak people out, but that's unlikely. She will likely turn out to be the benevolent queen of the Zelandoni with the handsome King Jondalar at her side, and little Princess Jonayla (puh-leez).That said, I'll hope for better things from the last book because I am an eternal optimist."
negative,"Greed One, Fans Zero: I can't add much to the other negative reviews, except to say that if Ms. Auel couldn't give her thousands of faithful fans an effort worthy of the previous books, she should have just let it (and us) go. If Jean Auel actually wrote this, then something is very, very wrong with her. Shame on her editor(s) and the publisher of this truly atrocious book, for wasting the money and, what's worse, the time of Ms. Auel's fans. I guess what with the ready made market, greed got the better of everyone involved. Well, they got my money this time. I hope they put it in the bank, because they won't get it again."
positive,"Very cool movie: This movie is one of the coolest if not the coolest, I recommend this for any transformer fan, I own the VHS version of this movie and im getting the DVD from here very soon because I want to see the changes and the cool stuff added to the DVD version of this movie.. I used to love transformers as a kid and I still do, and Megatron will always be my favorite Transformer out of them all because in my opinion I think he's the coolest, and I'll say Galvatron is cool too considering Megatron was transformed into Galvatron, but this movie is very very cool, better get a copy of this movie while its still availible!!"
positive,this is the best movie I ever watched.: The young guy who appeared in the first scene is super handsome. He has the perfect body and gorgeous face.
positive,"Fox Wedding: Well, i've had this on a videotape for almost ten years and just yesterday decided to watch it. I'm glad i did! Unfortunately it wasn't widescreen, but apparently the colors are better on video, and i'd prefer that. Mono no aware! (the sadness of things)ps. for advanced cases of nippophilia, try Lafcadio Hearn.pps. I just wanted to add that if you like this, find the story ""The Glass Coffin"" collected by Grimm. My thanks to the person who liked this review; the rest of you, however, have very bad taste."
positive,"Awesome Movie!: Dirty Dancing doesnt get any better than this! This a type a movie that will stand the test of time, never losing its appeal."
positive,"Another Eliot winner.: The truly amazing thing about George Eliot is her ability to make readers not just care, but actually ache for the characters in her novels. The tale of Maggie Tolliver has to be one of the most gut-wrenching in the whole of English literature. Unlike earlier reviewers, I found her trials totally believable, given the time in which she lived -- a time when women had absolutely no rights and were generally at the mercy of their fathers, brothers and husbands. I did not find the fact that Maggie's sense of duty, honor and decency forbade her from eloping with her cousin's fiancé the slightest bit implausible. What is sad is that modern-day readers mistake her nobility for ""wimpishness."""
positive,Great Antenna: I bought this antenna to go along with my first cb radio and I have to say that it works great. The magnet holds really well I haven't had any problems at all.Mr Electric
positive,"Intrigue, adventure, exciting- you get it all: I loved this book. I've read the entire series of the main character, Cat, but Catspaw I believe is best in the series. What's more, the book can stand alone. The unique writing kept me interested the entire journey, with the 1st person view of the main character, but his abilities to read minds lets you have the perspective of other characters in the book as well. I liked Cat's personality. He's real, with flaws, and fears, and yet does the right thing without being a do-gooder. Even the villians in the book seem real, and you can almost- but not quite- understand why they are the way they are.This story encompasses Cat being pressed into service to be a body guard for a political member of the very government he hates. You get political intrigue, a hint of romance, and a splendid view of a futuristic world with a well thought out plot. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
positive,"A thinking man's documentary on a band of hellions: Julian Temple directed this tour-de-force documentary on seminal punks The Sex Pistols. Loaded with interviews and behind the scenes footage (some never seen before), you can see why a band that only released one album in their short career has become such an icon of modern music. Whether you care for the band or not, do not miss this one!"
positive,"Amazing Artist: I love Clay Aiken, and I am a die-hard fan...I guess you could call me a ""Claymate."" The CD is really good, but I really would have liked to see some better-known writers (such as Neil Sedaka, who has said he would like to write for Clay) write some songs for the album and help to show off Clay's power and range. He does well on the songs here, but I know he's capable of better.A note to the negative reviewers: Most of you, I think, are either jealous of Clay of have nothing better to do. If you're going to write such horrible things about Clay, you should be doing something else with your time. You don't need to just blatantly come out and say ""Clay sucks."" It insults your own intelligence."
negative,"This is the most terrible movie ever!: How else can I put this? This is one of the worst horror movies ever made. I love the Halloween series and I have every Halloween movie on DVD including this one only because I didn't want a blank spot in my collection (was a gift). It took me about 4 months of it sitting on my DVD rack before I finally watched it one night. Big mistake! I can't believe that some people rated this with 5 stars. Oh my! If they rated part 3 that high, any of the other parts should be rated off the scale.."
positive,"a valuable resource: if you need to have clarity regarding the usage of the written word, this book will be a valuable, easy to use reference."
positive,"Excellent - Very Useful: I find this book highly useful as a desktop reference for just about anything HTML/DHTML related. In addition, Powell does a great job of introducing topics that may be new to some people, like XML."
positive,Classic SF: The middle of a trilogy that should be read in sequence. Lots of great characters and ideas. Asimov is the best
negative,"Not their best outting: I am going to have to disagree with most of the other reviews posted here. This is not the best that Stereolab has to offer. The first Stereolab records I heard were Dots & Loops and Cobra and Phase... I was absolutely blown away by those albums. I just couldn't get that excited about this one though. The songs are just kind of lifeless; they have some interested ideas, but never really get anywhere with them. It has the same Stereolab sound without any bounce or interplay between the instruments. I would recommend Dots & Loops over this one 7 days a week and twice on Sunday"
positive,"Not A Great Book By Any Means, But Well Written: Political space tales aren't really my thing, but I must say that, politics aside, I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like, but what it does do, it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though, and like most atheist writers, it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him, but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area. The mystical hints that run through nearly all of Arthur C Clarke's stories are the most intriguing thing about them. Asimov would have done well to have studied them."
positive,"unbelievable: One Thursday night my friend dragged me to see what I thought would be a really stupid film. Ok,Ok, it was...dump but in the same time different. I can only say I laughed like I have never laughed in a theatre before. Especially the kissing scene, that was so surprising. I really do think that the two main characters were great. It is not easy to play in a movie like this one. As you probably have noticed I have ""only"" given this movie 4 stars. My reason for this is, that though the film is UNBELIAVEBLE FUNNY, it is, and I think we all can agree on that, superficiel. If a film shall be given 5 stars, it has to be a film that can make you think and wonder. That is my opinion, but 4 stars for giving me a great experience. And then....!!!"
positive,"Hobbit: I read this book to get ready for the movie (which I still have not seen--given the poor reviews not sure I will). I read the book many years ago when I was just getting into Tolkien and then the Lord of the Rings. This is an entertaining read and really a quick read that introduces you to the fantasy world of middle-earth, with hobbits, elves, dwarves, etc. Anyone who enjoyed the triology will likely enjoy this as well."
negative,"No no no no no: I was in high school when this flick came out. My girlfriend wanted to see it, so I took her. I'm sure I almost died sometime during it. It was that bad.Full disclosure: I prefer movies with submarines and a lot of things blowing up, so take that into account."
negative,"Run for your life: I am currently in the 6th week of my Java class, and I still don't know the difference between a class and an object. This book is a waste of space. Nothing seems to be in the right place nothing is explained well at all. Its so bad that even with some other in my class to explain the concept of Java to me I still am not anywhere near where I should be. AVOID THIS BOOK WITH ALL POSSIBLE MEANS."
positive,"Mere Christianity Review: I have just received this book in the mail today. I am glad to say it's not beaten up like any other packages I received through amazon so that was a plus. Also The book was in great condition, I bought it used and it looks brand new. being a student in college I will have to say this is one book that if required, this is the best way to get it. if you have a problem with getting it then I guess it's bad luck so I would highly recommend ordering this book."
positive,Must see: I really liked this movie. I can't say I loved it because it was so depressing but it's one you want to see more than once. Unfortunately in today's world I found the movie very believable and very realistic. Will definitely add it to my movie collection.
positive,"Amazing!!!!: These puzzles are absolutely hilarious! Yet again, I'm blown away by the exquisite surprises, twists and turns. I've been stumped on a few of them for a few days now, but I'm not giving up! Shortz is, hands down, a genius. Try your hand at the masterful art within these pages, and enjoy the furrowed brow and laughs!"
negative,"Don't read this book first!: I found this book in the airport news stand and bought it without having read any others of the series. While reading, I thought often about just putting the book down and going on to something else - I wasn't carrying anything else.Having read the other reveiwers, I will accept that possibly I would have been better able to understand the story's origins had I read the other 9 books first. Also, I accept that the vast amount of detail missing at the end of the book may be found in the next of the series. I thought - and still wonder - that maybe there are omission of paragraphs, pages, and possibly chapters from the printing I have.I was looking for a stand alone story, not a book I would need to read nine before-hand and one or more afterwards to ""finish"".If you want to read one book to decide if you like the series, this is not the one."
positive,"Best Sleuth Spoof I've seen: Hysterical Movie. It is funniest if you are familiar with the old decective stories, but still very much enjoyable even if you are unfamiliar with all of the caricatures. All-star casting and excellent writing make this film a classic"
negative,Not as nice as the picture looked: The quality was less than I expected. The pillow on the back does not keep the lap desk secure and the pen/pencil holder set into the top right side gets in the way when writing. I saw a better one at Linens n' Things for $9.99. I did receive it right away and was happy with the delivery time.
negative,this was horrible: This book is one of the worst I have read!! Classic or not it still was bad!!! I had to read this for school and I hated it! It was soo simple. Only one thing happens in the entire book and that one thing isn't even exciting!
negative,doubleplusungood crimethinkers untruthful reviews: this morning at 235am dudes in ninja suits came into my house and stole my copy of this book. I was excited to read it before amazon.com stole it.
negative,"Mediocre plot, mediocre characters: A young, innocent girl is viciously murdered on a small island in Puget Sound. This homicide, the island's first, rocks the community, shaking loose endemic anti-Semitism and racism. The trouble is, the author practically gives away the identity of the murderer early on and then has to throw in many red herrings as a distraction. Finally, the conclusion is frustrating and sloppy, leaving this ready mighty disastisfied."
positive,"Author Shows Vision: Jeff's book ""Our Brown-Eyed Boy"" will stand the test of time. Although it has some minor editing problems, the content has character and vision. This parent's insights will be respected for the honesty and love that underlies the effort. I liked Jeff's poetry and pictures of his son at the end of the book. This added a very nice personal touch. I recommend the book to parents of autistic children and to all parents. I was inspired by his honesty."
negative,"Great Story-Bad Reproduction: Good sequal to ""Patton"". Worthy addition to the original. The quality of the dvd however leaves alot to be desired. My copy looks like a copy made from a VHS tape. But, for 1 cent & shipping I guess I can't complain."
positive,"Good quality, fast shipping: This thing arrived five days before the original estimated delivery date and even one day before the Fed-Ex date. Rolled nicely in the box without folds or crunching that would cause roll marks in the nap. Fits great on the dash in my 96 Camaro. The only thing to mention would be that where the dash drops to the right of the instrument panel the binding sticks out slightly further than anywhere else. Could only be on my particular piece, as I do not know if they are bound individually or machine run. Overall a great buy and worth every penny. I purchased this because my main dash plastic has several cracks and the dash mat was less than half the price of a new main dash panel and of course, less work. Best improvement to the car to date!"
positive,"Entertaining and enjoyable: This game was fun when I got it I was looking forward to getting home and getting started and straight away you will notice that the graphics for this game are great I mean I thought that (and sorry if I spoil it for anyone)and the voices are really hard to tell the difference from the real cast ( but I do think the voice of barbossa was here not sure)I also thought that the battle seens where there are those real fast sword clashes were great.Faults:well trying to use your gun and throwing knives is impossible to aim even with a area filled with enemys.also flashing from character to character was a little annoying but at times it was fun.Overall:well a good thing about this game is that it isn,t a simple button masher it actually has a lot of combos such as being able to punch and throw them around I esplcially like the ability to knee people in the nuts so it was really fun. but with very minor faults no game is perfect"
positive,"Well Done . . . Captures Joe's Live Show Personna!: Being a fan of Joe Jackson from his early ""Look Sharp!"" efforts to the present day ""Englishman trapped in New York"" stylings, I was very impressed with his recent concert this spring here in Milwaukee. This CD, although directed at a New York audience, really does renew his concert experience and exhibits Joe's versatility in a live format.He truly is unique and covers material by the Beatles, Yardbirds, Ramsey Lewis, and my favorite - Steely Dan - in a very novel manner. It would be great to hear more colaborations with another transplanted New Yorker - Donald Fagan - to see what other jazz, pop, swing, or other sounds might ensue.I would give this a 5-star rating, but for the weak finish of the CD - a less than inspiring JJ piece.Definitely a MUST for any JJ fan collection . . . and a great introduction to any new fans looking for a truly original musician with a love for entertaining and the craft of music."
positive,"Lot's Of Laughs - Chaotic Comedy: Using that most serious of events, a funeral, as a setting for a comedy that has everything from bathroom humor to clever bits about misuse of hallucinogens and sexual blackmail was brilliant. The movie is very tightly written and directed with some very good British actors providing good all around performances. Death At A Funeral is definitely worth checking out for some laughs."
negative,"2nd Worst Old School MK Gameboy Game: I purchased this awful gameboy game 15 years hoping it would be as good as it's predecessor-but no such luck!MK3 does'nt have a link cable option(like it's 2 predecessors before)nor does it have any SGB enhancements(border,color,sound).Though it incorporates the same digitize graphics and sound as Gameboy's THQ's Super Return Of The Jedi-which 2 sucked.Nevertheless,pick up MK2 instead."
negative,"Misleading: If you are interested in learning about Saudi Arabia, this is not the book for you. It is a collection of the writer's true or imagined sexual experiences. Having lived in many countries I believe there is so much to see, learn, teach, get involved in, etc.,that focusing on sex is a waste of the experience. Writing style and vocabulary is also very simple, almost childlike. I'm almost finished with the book, and so far there is only one chapter that I found interesting."
negative,Guess I screwed up....: I bought this book thinking this would be about horse sense for people about horses....but its not about horses. Which had me confused....its about 'horse' sense for people? Whatever. I didn't end up finishing this book.
positive,"The Third Secret: I loved this book!!!!! I was sorry when it was finished. I love all of Steve Berry's books, except his newest one The Paris Vendetta. I felt he tried too hard and the story was not as interesting."
positive,"Like the first, but withoutt he dark edge.: This album still has the great vocals, and the rock and techno combination. So whats the big difference between this and their self- titled album? The songs on this one don't have the same dark edge and I don't think that Shirley's vocals work as well. That being said its still a good album and worth a buy (after you've purchased their first). Best songs:Temptation Waits- Seductive.I think I'm Paranoid- Has a pretty dark vibe to it.When I grow up- Being a teenager I really relate to the lyrics.Medication- It does for this album what ""Queer"" did for their first.Special- Catchy.Push it- Interesting lyrics."
negative,"Simply awful: I know its very hard to bring a book like Moby-Dick to the screen, but at least John Houston tried in the 1950's. This made-for-TV adaptation makes me wonder if the screenwriters and director even read the original book. Not only is the character of Queegueg depicted incorrectly as a Mauri of New Zealand (in reality Melville based the character on the Nuku-Hivans), but he is treated as a buffoonish and stereotypical ""savage"" which is completely at odds with the dignified character that Melville created. Additionally, the filmmakers dreamt up a bizarre scene where the Pequod is stranded in the ice of the Antarctic! They must have been reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstien at the time. Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab however, is wonderful, but that's the only redeeming feature of this overblown mess."
positive,"Good - but not her best: I have purchased three of other Bjorks releases (Vespertine, Greatest Hits, Medulla) and this is sadly the worst (not to say It's bad, I did give it 4 stars) but this just seems too simplistic for Bjork, although I do like her dance/club songs from her debut.The standouts are Army of Me (4/5), It's Oh So Quiet (4.5/5 - my favourite), Enjoy (4/5), I Miss You (4/5), and Headphones (4/5) and I don't really like tracks 8 and 10.Some sales information for you:: Sold 3 million copies w/w, and peaked at #2 in Australia, #32 in USA and also went platinum there. It's Oh So Quiet was Bjork's greatest hit in Sales and it won numerous awards.79%"
negative,"Bad Quality: It was ok for the first month but after, the clips that attach the two pieces together start to break. It is really annoying as you need to take it off to clean the phone and it seems every time I do a piece comes off. You get what you pay for. If you are looking for something that will last for longer than a month I would suggest looking elsewhere."
positive,"Works great with a boring machine.: I use these selfeed bits in a B.M. Root Boring Machine and they work fantastic. I have bored through about 1500 2x6's and the bit has not showed any signs of dulling. The only thing you have to be careful about are the 1"" bits clog pretty easily. The 1 1/2"" bits are pretty much self cleaning."
negative,"DOA: This item arrived as advertised. We plugged the charger into our car and it did not work; no light, no charging. We thought it might be the port in the car. Tried others in the same car; it still did not work. We tried the charger in another car with the same results. We did not send the unit back due to the price we paid plus the shipping. I guess you do get what you pay for."
positive,Appropriately named diapers: Pampers Baby Dry are the only brand that *almost* without fail keeps my baby dry. My toddler still wears this brand and they usually last even throughout the night.
positive,"THE sub for the under $300 category: I have owned this sub for 7 years now, matched with my Paradigm 7.1 setup. I love it. You cant find a sub to outperfom it without getting above $400, in my opinion. Great value."
positive,Great book: I owned a 1938 Cadillac when I graduated from High School. It was in it. Great photos of this classic era of General Motors best.
negative,"Font is way too small - returned product!: I was eager to purchase this bible because of other reviews...The ESV's language and apparent accuracy was a draw for me. However, when I received this product, I was very dissapointed. The font was TINY and after attempting to read this bible, I felt frustrated and put it down. Not a feeling you want to have during bible study."
negative,"Too Many Omissions to Count...: The name of the film is American Hardcore, but never once mentioned are seminal Hardcore legends Reagan Youth, Warzone and the Angry Samoans. The Dead Kennedys, Misfits, Husker Du, 7 Seconds and Suicidal Tendencies are briefly mentioned and in no way given their due. Much of the running time of the documentary focuses on the California, Boston and DC scenes. But how can you cover Cali in depth without delving deep into the Dead Kennedys? The film is completely disjointed and has no rhyme or reason as they move from California to Boston back to California to DC and then briefly to New York. I know the intention was good but the product is subpar and heinously omits bands that should have gotten their 15 minutes for their contributions to this important underground scene. Not recommended."
positive,"Combat really combats German roaches: From holidays in a Near East country I brought back spices which were contaminated by coakroaches. For over half a year I tried everything to get the roaches out of my house. No remedy helped really and I got desperated in the end. Then I came across ""COMBAT"" and since 2 weeks of using the product the number of insects is going rapidly down. There is hope that COMBAT will destroy the roaches completely."
positive,"Round Perditions Flames: I though this was a great film mainly because of the acting, Patrick Stewart, best known as Captain Picard from Star Trek the Next Generation, fits the Character of Ahab perfectly. Though the film looses a star for the quite dodgy special effects, Herman Mellville's story and A cast of great actors lift it up into a classic."
negative,"Vivendi Screws Up Another Franchise: The only thing that worked properly in this game was the installation. There was obviously no QA or beta testing for this version. The mouse controls are so out of whack I couldn't even get past the tutorial let alone the first level. Call me cynical, but I think this was done on purpose to get people the buy the console versions. It's really sad because I really wanted to play this game due to the ""what if"" storyline. First Leisure Suit Larry now this. Burn in hell VUG!!"
negative,not for children: My eight year old son came home with this and after reading a little I took it away from him. This is the kind of stuff that warps minds and is only appropriate for those already warped. There are plenty of those.Make sure your kids don't read this untill they are older. Its all about killing and screaming in a tour of hell.
negative,"User Beware!: My wife purchased this product for her use. This product worked well and she was happy with it until...she rec'd a shock to her little finger while drying damp hair to discover 4 months later, she has permanent nerve damage to this finger. ouch!! She has not used it since being shocked."
positive,"Must have!: This DVD is a must have for anyone who is going through childbirth...your birthing class may not explain things with this much clarity and detail (I know my didn't). I learned a lot about breathing, and controlling your breath, and although I am not planning on using drugs through labor, I thought her section on medical interventions very useful."
negative,Pampers Baby Wet: These diapers absorb MUCH less than Swaddlers. They don't have a prayer of lasting through the night despite the claim they last twelve hours. Really disappointing product.
positive,"These are great!: These swaddleme covers are a great help with newborns and infants. They feel secure and sleep better, longer. Try it, I think you will love it! They make great gifts."
positive,"Best price for this poster/quick shipping: I ordered this for my husbands weight room, and it is exactlly what I wanted, it is the best price on the internet, but if i were to order again, I would get the cover and stuff to hang it since I got it almost a month ago, and haven't put it up because it comes in a tube so I will need to get something to put it up. (but that was my choice to leave that off the order)It also takes awhile to ship, maybe because I am a prime member, I'm used to prompt shipping, but even still, it seemed to take a bit long to get.Overall great poster, and anyone who snowboards will love it!"
negative,"Yes it sucked!: I too took the class with John Mitchell in Stanford a few years back. The manuscript, which now is this book, was very poorly written, erroneous, inconsitent and not even complete! It's one of the worst classes I've taken at Stanford. I believe I could've benefited more from the class had he put students' interest first by choosing a better textbook.I don't know why he put so much empathsis on ML. Had he put some decent effort in helping people actually understand ML, maybe it won't have been so frustrating (back then it was pre-2000, so there weren't many ML material available online - and you haven't heard of Google yet:-). For functional language, wouldn't Lisp be a better example for instructive purposes?Someone in the class at that time suggested him talk about scripting languages such as Perl (Python is now getting interesting). That would be useful comparison. But that was brushed aside.I would not buy this book unless you have no choice."
negative,Stinks: This movie was terrible. If there was an option for - stars I would go there.Read the book it's much more entertaining!
positive,"It is decent. It was a little overpriced for the quality though.: I bought the book for college and it has served it's purpose. It is a good book. There is quite a bit of writing in it and some of the pages are bent and wrinkly, but it was a good buy."
positive,"A Mixed Bag: I thoroughly appreciate the illustrations of how the Hobbit has been illustrated in other countries that are included in this edition. The introduction is first rate, though mysteriously it uses end notes while the rest of the book uses annotation in the margin. The notes that delve into the possible sources and influences on Tolkien's thought and work are mostly interesting and informative. The main negative I find is how many marginal notes are devoted to textual variants between the various editions. For example, in the section where the company meets the trolls, a note explains one version has ""they dropped him"" while another version has ""he dropped him."" Although the textual variant notes are usually more extensive than this, they are an uninteresting disappointment to me. The level of detail is high, but at times, almost to the point of being pedantic. Still, if you love the work of Tolkien, you will find this version enjoyable as well."
negative,"Boring: I bought this movie for my wife, she really likes Jane Austin stories, and she really didn't like this movie. The acting wasn't good, and the story was worse."
positive,Ken Davis-Is it just me: We ran across this entertainer on TV one night and bedame very interested in his work. My wife and I both enjoyed his show and wanted others to see it so we ordered the same show on DVD thru Amazon. This man is very sincere with his message along with the humor he uses in his act. It's very refreshing to watch a comic that doesn't have to use foul language to make his point. I have watched several other of his performances and plan on purchasing more to show to others.
negative,I worry about those who take this book seriously: This book is fiction. Sad fiction at that. Ridiculous fiction actually. Note the dearth of footnotes or authoritative quotes. This book was written by a man who was clearly an anti-Catholic bigot -- often times for people who are on the same ungodly road as the author was on until he passed away and came face to face with his judge -- Jesus Christ.This book is such a horrible fabrication of hatred and lies that I truly wonder about the spiritual and intellectual health of those who actually recommend this fetid work.Don't waste your time. This is sewage. You can read these sorts of lies on the web for free...
positive,My wife loves it: I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. She used to wear it but no stores around us carry it anymore. Thank-you Amazon for having it for us.
negative,"The 'Best' more like the worst compilation!: Yes, an overview of latin rhythms but that is my only favorable comment. This is truly a hodge-podge of recorded material and no musical credits are given, as to 'who is playing' or 'when any particular track was recorded'. This disc's 1st track is a piano solo but don't be fooled into thinking that would occur again - oh no - that would be too logical - and logic plays no role here!"
positive,Christmas present: I ordered this DVD & several others as presents. They all arrived in good shape & on time for Christmas morning.
positive,"About ""Convection Heat Transfer"" by A. Bejan: A.Bejan gave to the field of thermal sciences a new breath. His particular touch and way of thinking leads to unexplored scientific and technical territories. Due to its original spirit for thermal sciences and, more generally, for physics, the book, Convection Heat Transfer , presents the essential keys of the field for the engineering students but also for researchers. I usually recommend this elegant book to my students."
positive,"Mr. Trower's bestest original album!: I was never a Trower (""Bridge of Sighs"") fan, but you don't have to be to get excited about an album so fine! What really stands out is just how great his guitar sounds, it's the best in the business. And the timber of his vocals really match it like a hand in glove. 5 or 6 gotta-have-it greats; the rest of the album is interesting. Bluesy, jazzy, and kind of psychedelic."
negative,"you can find better copies of these movies: you can find these four movies in many other collections and more besides. the qualty of this disc is just not that good. for a few dollars more you can get a set that has many of his early movies in them,so stick to those."
positive,"Great Classic Everyone Should Read: Orwell's classic about Big Brother that will really keep you thinking. I read in High School and then again recently. Although 1984 is long past, the ideas put forth in this book shadow a darker image of what America could become that will make you think.Great classic! Go read it."
positive,Heavy duty rack: This is a nice solid heavy duty rack. I like the fact that bikes can be loaded easily. It would be nice if the specs were a little larger to make a snugger fit in a class III hitch.
negative,"This: Very sticky. Don't buy. I'm picky so this might work for others, but trust me there are better lubricants available."
positive,"CLAY AIKEN IS AWESOME AND SO IS THIS CD!!!: This is a GREAT CD for Clay Aiken, the best tracks on this CD are Track 1 Invisible and Track 6 Run to me. I think he will have number one hits with both. The whole CD is great and it shows Clays talent and his versatility as an artist, they really did a good job with this one, Clay I Love Ya!!!!"
negative,Not my cup of tea: For some reason this CD just sounded really corney to me. I was really dissapointed. Your opinion may differ but I would recommend that if you are looking for a classical Zeppelin CD you get Kashmir instead. It is cheaper and shines a new light on some awsome songs rather than butchering them.
negative,"Shallow, implausible read: Okay...you have Tony- a twenty-something dude w/ dead end job, loser roommate, and no girlfriend. We never learn exactly WHY he decides to do community service work, but...he is on a Hotline team. The hotline is peopled by hot teen age girls in skimpy attire and a couple of oddball older guys like Tony.None of the characters or the plot twists are believable at all and of course it ends with Tony still lusting after the seventeen year old and waiting for her to ""be of age"". Hopefully she too will get murdered before she has to sleep with this loser in a sequel."
positive,"A must read: I first picked up 'The Satanic Mill' when I was in Primary School. Now, seven years later, the book popped back into my head and I remembered how much I had loved it when I first read it all those years ago. So I bought a copy, and read it - and despite an ice-age of seven years, I still loved it."
negative,"Yuppie View of WWII Americans: Unfortunately, this book is just a series of repetitive ""snippets"" that really does little to tell the story of this generation. I am about Brokaw's age and my parents and their brothers and sisters numbered 17 in total. I have heard all the stories, and have three uncles buried in Europe. I found Brocaw with little talent (this book could have been done by a mediocre college sophomore) and a love for ""Brocaw"". Never have I seen a ""talking head"" lever his TV exposure to the extent this guy has. He, like a lot of his generation gave little, reaped plenty and are looking for legitimacy via the accomplishments of their parents.Also, please note he put his name on every other page. Really a tacky work. The ""ME"" generation is true to form !!!!"
positive,"Amazing!: Maybe the first book about which I can honestly say , I couldn't put it down! The way the story unfolds and resonates with the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ is remarkable!"
negative,"Believe the negative reviews: As a realtor, I was very excited about this camera for wide angle interior shots at a low price in a very compact package. Unfortunately, the picture quality is very dissapointing. The images are barely adequate for web posting and brochure printing. Pictures are very soft and seem out of focus. I'll keep using it until I can find a better alternative without dropping over a grand on a digital SLR with a wide angle lense. If anyone know of a better quality, compact wide angle - please let me know!"
negative,"Detour ...: I am a great admirer of ""Detour"" which is probably the best low-budget film noir ever made. But this DVD is a piece of junk. It is transferred from a lousy, battered 35mm print that has badly spliced gaps and screwed-up film footage in crucial scenes, obliterating some of the best dialogue. The company that put this out should be ashamed of itself, especially considering this film is now considered a low-budget masterpiece. If you have no copy of this, get the Sinister Cinema VHS. It is a much higher quality print."
negative,"after a rear of once a day use it failed: The B70 worked fine for about a year or so, then failed. It started giving small amounts of water, then stopped giving water entirely. I read articles on the internet and it appeared that the air pump that pushes the hot water out of the heating tub was what failed. I dismantled the machine enough to get the air pump out. It was totally seized due to rust. I did not take the Keurig apart enough to find out what was leaking onto the motor. I think it was the solenoid. POOR POOR design. Nearly impossible to service. Parts not available if you did want to service it. I don't know what brand is better, but this one should be avoided."
negative,"This album straight sucks: I want my money back. After Elva and Music in High Places, I expected more, not just some really intelligent band trying to be hard... badly."
negative,"Disappointing: One truly great song (the first on the disc) followed by 11 weird takes on Mexican folk music and depressing moans. The brilliant arrangement and accompaniment of the first song ""Mi Cara de Pared,"" a sexy, mournfully loping tango, led me to expect greatness within, but alas, Lhasa is a one-trick pony, one with a potentially great voice, which is reduced to strained yodelling on the subsequent uninteresting numbers. It's almost as if she were undecided what category she wanted to present herself in - is it world music? Latin? Pop? Rock? Unfortunately it seems to be none of the above. If I want Mexican folk songs, I'll call Linda Ronstadt. The arranger and producer (name forgotten) should have waited to present the CD when he had more tricks up his sleeve and the singer had better songs. A great disappointment - but that first number is a killer."
positive,"One of my favorite movies of all time!: I adore this movie! The actors are phenominal the story is incredible, I don't have a bad thing to say about it. Simply the best telling of this story ever!"
positive,"Fairly good story line: This is a fairly good story about an English Duke and his 6 year old daughter who comes to the U.S. to visit his brother. (Sequal to ""A Cowboy at Heart"") His mother tells everyone that he is searching for a wife. This causes a lot of problems. He hooks up with Sydney, a young woman trucker. Because of his unhappy first marriage, he refuses to accept that he loves Sydney, but with the help of his daughter, mother and brother, everything turns out well. There is one part of the story where Sydney is being hasseled by another driver on the C.B. I was dissatisfied with the way this was handled, but all in all it is a cute story and a quick read."
negative,"What?: There should be laws against this kind of thing. The only connection between this film and the books OR the previous two films with the same cast (which were very good), is the names. I couldn't find one single thing that happened in any of the books in this film. It's not even a good film by itself - the plotline is really silly and none of the characters or their actions are at all appealing - as another reviewer has said, the part where she gives away Green Gables is just WRONG. The whole film is completely depressing. L M Montgomery would have a fit."
negative,"Reviewing Twayne's Study, not the novel.: This was very disappointing -- the ""analysis"" of Middlemarch. The author simply took all his lectures to college students over the years about his interpretation of Middlemarch.There are many, many better reviews of Middlemarch. Pass on this one.Again, I'm not sure if folks realize they are reviewing Middlemarch or the Twayne Study, or if Amazon.com is putting the reviews in the wrong place.As for the novel Middlemarch itself, yes, it's obviously a book that must be read by anyone serious about literature.Father of the novel: Cervantes, Don QuixoteFather of the English novel: Defoe""Father"" of the first great modern novel: George Eliot"
positive,"The Dead Zone is one frighteing & unforgettable jouney: A unforgettable film next to CARRIE & SALEM`S LOT this is another of Stephen King`s mesmerizing novels adapted to the screen thanks mostley to the landmark performance of Christopher Walken. His chracter Johnny Smith,a school teacher who after survivng a fatal car crash inherits the ability to foresee the future. Outstanding performence from Walken Along with THE DEER HUNTER & THE DOGS OF WAR this is another classic from Christopher Walken. A horror film with this magnitude and the abillty to place a chill in your soul is something of a lost art nowadays with today`s unappealing and unoriginal Horror films."
negative,"Oh no,: It is in movies like these that I really miss poltergeist, the fog, and the good old scarefests that really knew how to scare.This movie is good, in the beginning, when it all isn't so complex.But then, after that, the story really gets really complex, and instead, about evil being just evil, it is really about some old fartknocker who is some marble short. In the end of the movie, it is just a concept that has swallowed a little bit of its own lunch, and some bad acting as well.No. The effects are so so. But it doesn't matter much if you don't believe in the movie. Trust me, don't watch this one, its an experience which won't be the worst film you'll ever see. But hardly the best either."
positive,"wtg henry james!!!: i recommend to everyone to start with the american if they have an interest in henry james, but haven't yet read anything by him. the american isn't so much of the l'art pour l'art movement as his later works, as he was pretty young when he wrote this. nonetheless, this is still a classic. christopher newman can come off as arrogant but throughout the book one enjoys him more and more. the ending is great, with christopher finally being vindicated. for whatever it's worth, i read james' the princess casamassima after this. it's a good follow-up for one who has just been introduced to h. james, although it isn't so much concerned with the old world vs new world theme as is the american."
positive,"Good ones but No indicator: Only minus point is this product has no indicator.Product is good better than other ones in market, initially i was worried whether this would leak as i read some reviews, i had never faced leakage till now,there is no leakage in this Baby DRY Pammer product, may be i havent tried for more than 12 hours, absoultely good for a 3-4 month old baby."
negative,"Worked fine - for 6 months.: I bought this unit last spring and used it for trimming grass in areas where I didn't want to use the standard cord-trimmer. Had reasonable power and was nice to use, until the NiCd battery died in the fall (after using it once a week). Bought a new manufacturer's battery for it, and that worked once in the fall. Battery is dead again this spring.If you buy it, get an extended warranty that covers the battery. I will try a Worx this time, and see if its Lion battery lasts longer."
negative,"What's the fuss all about?: I was cajoled into reading this ""required reading for all of humanity"" masterpiece. I had to fight to finish this novel - I thought that at the very least, it would be as magical as Allende's House of Spirits, but I was severely disappointed. Unlike everyone else (or so it seems everyone else), this book did not change my sensibilities. The best part of the book was the last 40 or so pages, which ALMOST, almost, made the other 400 pages worthwhile. I do not doubt Garcia Marquez' talent -- what I do believe is a lot was lost in the translation!"
negative,"pound the booty for 20 min.....: it was a predator remake... a terrible one! the movie sucked. pay close attention to what they say, and there weapons (which change constintantly in there hands).. just bad, when one male soldier asks another male soldier if they have postpartum depression (depression that can happen to women after they have a baby) you start to question things. at one point, a soldier with a complete serious face, trying to act cool. said this ""I really need to stop smoking these things, i used to punish the booty for 2 hrs. now i can only last 20 min"". he was completely serious! just terrible... the blood was so bad that when someone got shot in the head, it looked like a spray can of red paint was shot from the back of his head.I tried to rate this as 0 stars, but this site did not allow me."
negative,"Too many bugs!: Although I was able to play the first two games in the series without problems, and although I have updated drivers, and my computer meets all of the necessary requirements, I couldn't get past one minute of game play without the game freezing or shutting down. Way too many bugs and no support online. I would avoid this one."
positive,"An American Classic: From The Scarlet Letter to Wise Blood, American literature is known for its short novels, and this is a great one. Schaefer took the simple, direct prose style of Twain and Hemingway and used it perfectly, carefully weighing every word for emotional effect.The book is usually kept in the children's section of bookstores, because the vocabulary is basic. It was the first I ever read, when I was seven or eight. But it is a great book for anyone, crackling with tension. The first page alone is worth the price."
positive,"GReat new cd from Rainer Maria: If you are already a fan, you will love this new album. Less heavy guitar and more vocals, it is an easy and pleasant listen.One of thier best!"
negative,"Puritanism at its best.: This is SELF-righteous, SELF-centered Historical Puritanism at its best. This is the foundation of the ""I'm right and everyone else is wrong,"" Puritanical UN-Christianity. Always remember there is a big difference between a Puritan and a Christian (Look those two words up for yourself!)."
negative,"Thoroughly Debunked: This book is typical Keel--chock-full of anecdotes, skewed information, speculation, hoaxes (many of Keel's ""weird"" experiences in the case were jokes perpetrated by Gray Barker)--all presented as factual reporting.""Mothman"" does not exist. Several writers--most notably Joe Nickell--have thoroughly debunked the incident. But true facts have never stopped Keel.I'm a fan of Keel's writings, but you have to take them with a grain of salt. This is not one of his best efforts, and it rankles me that he positions himself as a serious journalist."
positive,"Not So bad: If you want a little more paine than what is written in common sense, this is definately worth your while!"
negative,"A total dud: Opened the box, unrolled the mattress, plugged in the motor and then... the motor made a few feeble noises and shut off in less than three seconds. Plugged it into several different outlets with the same results.Intex customer service told me that there are NO WARRANTIES on their air mattresses and the only option was to return it to Amazon for a refund. I will not be ordering any products from Intex in the future."
negative,junk: This contraption does not mix the miracle gro evenly. Why they put their name on something like this is beyond me
negative,"tosses out morality and rationality.......: The Stranger is an existential story of a man living his life as a self-determing individual. He feels that nothing is truly wrong or right and therefore nothing that he does makes any difference or has any real impact except to himself. It is almost as if he is on a stage writing his life as he goes, acting it out and the rest of the universe is merely a backdrop for whatever he chooses to pursue. It is a timeless novel that tosses out morality and rationality as a means to make choices. It shows a vast emptiness, a soulessness that is overpowering in its totality. This is an amazing, insightful look at life where no matter what one does, the end will always be the same. It is interesting to note that Camus while having the belief that the universe was a cold and indifferent place, still believed in the dignity of each individual being and had a concern for their welfare. It is one of the most widely read books, but it is bleak in an eye-opening manner."
positive,"One of his best: It only took a couple listens before I began wishing I could ""delete"" the monologues on this record. The songs are all quite strong, however. While they are superficially unusual in form, their topicality is straight down the middle Iggy. By which I mean that for what this stuff is, it's as good as it gets."
positive,"I can't help it; I liked this CD.: First of all, I would not have bought this CD if it were recorded by any one other than Clay Aiken.I like the guy; I think he's the ""real deal"".I actually like the song Invisible more than I thought I would.It is very catchy and I find myself singing it long after I've turned it off.I don't find most of the other songs to be outstanding or even greatly original. I do however enjoy Perfect Day and No More Sad Songs. Clearly Clay had a hand in choosing some of these tunes as the lyrics reflect on Clay's own professed religious and spiritual beliefs. Most of the songs allow Clay to showcase his beautiful vocals.BR>I would love to hear him do Solitaire and to hear Bridge over Troubled Water again. I wish that those two cuts were on this CD.I am looking forward to hearing more from Clay; original music and covers that really show what he's got.I wish Clay all the success in the world and am happy to do my part to support his future in music."
positive,"Garden's Corner is a tale of awakening and perseverence.: Garden's Corner is a book that everyone should read. The book allows the reader to see him/herself in the characters. It teaches you many of lifes great lessons in terms of family and friendship. Little Speedy Copeland and his grandmother, Miss Pearl, are characters whom you can relate to. Through Little Speedy's encounters you learn that no matter what trials and tribulations you have gone through you should never give up. You should look forward instead of dwelling in the past."
positive,"Wonderfully Simple Book!: As a professional organizer, I love to learn simple and helpful tricks to teach my clients. This book touches on all areas of your life and you can't be cluttered in one area of life without it spilling over to others. This book is a positive and very useful resource for ""cleaning up"" your life and being more peaceful when you use the suggestions. Do yourself a favor and get this one!Jennifer Baron, Professional Organizerwww.ButterflyJourneyOrganizing.com"
positive,"At LEAST 15 minutes of listening pleasure!: This is what I listen to when I'm in my Adult Contemporary mood. (Well it's Kershaw more often than it is Springsteen) I've heard of all Nik's old 80's albums, and this really makes them sound bad. I mean, of course, songs such as ""The Riddle"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Good"" are better than anything on earth, but this new material is consistently impressive.""Billy"" is instantly likeable, while songs like ""Shine On"" and ""Made in Heaven"" are the slower favourites. ""God Bless"" is the only stinker, while every other song entertains us with cool guitars and songs that really grow on you over time.I guess all I'm trying, to say, it's worth the wait when an artist perfects their art instead of churning out rubbish twice a year."
positive,"This is a good film.: I think it was a very instereting story.Though,there was not any inspirity deeplyin the film.But,surely.Encouraging the young people how to face the problem,when they were un the critical situation.On the other hand,parents could learned something from it.That was:Working was not everything.To share the feeling with childrenwere more important.Anyway,it was a great film.I sugest,if you falied to get alone with your kids.May be it's a good choice to see this movie."
positive,movie: Just what I needed for a gift. It was just what my nephew wanted at a reasonable price. Thanks for being competitive and having what I needed.
negative,Don't buy this: Krishnamurti himself asked people not to pay attention to his immature teachings (prior to about 1933). For a scholar this book gives a look into K's mind as a youngster but it doesn't portray the important elements of his teachings which flourished after around 1933.
negative,"Signet Shakespeare Kindle verions: To be completely honest, I have only examined the sample for this e-text of Romeo and Juliet. It was a very unhelpful sample, giving a selection of the introductory essay about Shakespeare's life and times.So I scoured the review page. None of the reviews I looked at are actually for the e-version of this book. They were written for a variety of paper versions of the book, good, bad, and ugly. Some are about a specific used book purchased, others are about the play itself (love it/hate it). None of them help determine the value of this specific e-version of the play.Bottom line, I refuse to pay $4.99 for a version that I can't get any information about. How does it look on the page? Are there additional annotations beyond the essay about Shakespeare's life and times? Are there links to acts or scenes? Are there line numbers?"
negative,The conclusion should have been happy instead of terrible.: John Steinbeck uses too many cuss words in this book. I think George should have watched Lennie more so he wouldn't get into so much trouble all of the time. This book isn't really worth reading if you have a choice. It's too short and the conclusion doesn't make much sense.
negative,"Eugene Levy would put out a better album: Listening to this album made me question my own life. It is simply unoriginal, boring and really bad. Save your money."
positive,"It is a very BRIEF! but very lucid and fun to read!: You defintely can judge the book by its cover on this book. I really liked it a lot. I used this book as a reference tool to teach my philosophy/ethics class in college. This is defintely not for the serious philosophy student, but a very nice introduction to the ideas that dominated western thought throughout the Greek/Roman world that has come to us today. It also treats postmodernism, and the ideas that dominates today as well. This book presents a very lucid history of ideas that is very enjoyable and fun to read!Because I had to interloan the book from another library and I am unable to renew it, I will buy it after I place this review. ..."
negative,"A CD with only two good songs: The CPD is one of the bands trying to bring back the swing craze. They have two good songs on their CD (the rest are not all that great) and two songs can't make one whole CD great. If you are desperate for only two songs, I suggest that you buy the singles or listen to a friend's CD. This is not an all around great CD. You want some good swing, go buy the Big Bad Vodoo Dady's CD. They can play better, and all of their songs are good. Beat that Cherry Poppin' Daddies. Do NOT buy this CD!!!!!"
positive,"Perfect for docking: This expanding boat hook is the perfect choice for docking, it expands easily and has a good size hook for grabbing the dock or a line or for pushing off. I highly recommend this product and would buy it again-"
negative,"Don't buy NuVision Edition: I just got my 2007 edition copy of ""Interpretation of Dreams"" in the mail so I haven't had a chance to read it. So this rating is only on the particular edition that is published by NuVision. They did not include an index or any information about who translated this version. Also, the table of contents is nearly worthless; no detail what-so-ever about the chapters, not even titles of the chapters, just Chapter 1 etc. and a page number. Even though you may think a newer publication is better, this one is much much worse and more expensive. Go with the 1980 publication. I'm returning the book to Amazon (who gets 5 stars for customer service!)"
positive,"A Beautiful Book: I bought a similar Inga Moore version of this book for my son and we love it. The text has been ""sensitively abridged"" to make it appropriate for young children and the result is a delightful story that brings small animals to vivid life. Inga Moore's illustrations are what drew me to this book. They are wonderfully detailed and evocative of the beauty of the Thames Valley."
positive,"Egermeier's Bible Story Book: This is a book that I have read and had read to me many times. It is the Bible Story Book that my parents read to me before I was old enough to read, and I continued to read the wonderful Bible stories on my own for many years. I purchased a copy for my child and each of my grand children as well as the children of many of my relatives. The stories are presented in language that is easy for children to understand, and is exciting for them to hear and read. The only way to really appreciate this book is to read it aloud with children, listen to their questions and comments, and share with them the great stories of the Bible. To say the least, I highly reccommend this wonderful book."
positive,"Can't say the least: This is far by my most favorite CD. It fits into all my favorite kinds of techno. I loved Xpander but this just tops it. It seems more complex and it just sounds cooler than any of the other techno CD's I own. So if I could I'd give this a 10.The CD starts out with a interesting yet peaceful start with Dremples.Then goes into Mr. Tiddles and has kinda a sneaky game type music. The it folds into a spacey kinda song, Magnetic North.Then the pace sorta picks up in Cloud Cuckcoo. Things just get faster and more ravish like from there, but never hits the point where you could really dance to it. Immortal-Bloodlock are like that, then it takes a sudden twist into a soft almost romantic type song, one of my favorites. Then speeds things up to end the CD, by going into Golden Arm and finishes perfectly with Wavy Gravy, my favorite song."
negative,"This is the worst book ever!: Excuse me, reader from St. Louis, but i find it very rude of you to adress my best friend, tina, as being stupid. WOW so she hates the book! SO WHAT! she is only trying to save humanity. I hate this book also, so go ahead and write about how I'm stupid. I dont care! Anyway, this book is aweful and it made me want to through myself into a brick wall.. I had to read it for school, and obviously the teachers want us to be stressed out since they force us to read this book. It is so choppy and stupid.. who cares about the GREAT SLEEP and THE WEB OF LIFE or the GREAT TWITCH??? I CERTAINLY DON'T! THOSE THINGS ARE NEVER GOING TO HELP ME GET THROUGH LIFE, AND HAVING THE ""SECRET KNOWLEDGE"" WILL ABSOLUTELY HELP IN NO WAY WHAT-SO-EVER ALSO! SO IF YOU DONT TAKE MY ADVICE AND STAY CLEARR FROM THIS BOOK, DONT SAY I DIDNT WARN YOU!"
negative,"Didn't like...: I didn't like this version of the song, ""when you believe,"" even though it was the original. I favored the orchestral rendition of this song which was beautifully arranged by Hans Zimmer."
positive,"Chuck Taylor's: What can be said about a pair of canvas tennis shoes ?They fit, the laces tie, I wear them."
negative,"Don't waste your money: I purchased this in hopes of (like everyone else) having something that would warm a cold bottle in the car fairly quickly. This is NOT the product for the job! It takes forever, and actually makes the bottle too hot to handle without warming the milk much at all. The outside of the warmer gets way hot, too. Definitely a danger to you and children to touch. Luckily I have not had the problem some others have had with it melting my bottle, but I am not going to use it again to risk that!! In fact, I think the company needs to be notified so they will recall this product before someone gets hurt!!"
positive,best home speakers ive ever heard: I have been a big fan of JBL speakers for years. I needed to upgrade to handle the power of the stereo system I bought.The speakers are outstanding in quality and sound reproduction.
negative,"Legs fall off all the time: This ballhopper is almost unusable. The legs fall off when moved from the handle position to the leg position. They also fall of when used as handles to pick up the balls. I suppose there is a solution to secure the handles with rubber bands, but I haven't tried it yet. As it is sold, it is a piece of junk."
positive,"Good choice: A classic is a classic, but additional features in this edition make it a great choice. Nice illustrations, too!"
positive,"Love the cover....tres chic!: This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too! I have only read one of the books (Wuthering Heights) and I liked it. I was planning on giving these as gifts, but now I am going to keep them! My only qualm...the pages are bright white, and I wish they had gone with a more ""vintage-y"" look on the inside to match the outside. But I guess they will get that with age ;)"
negative,"Not specific enough: I was intrigued by the title, so I purchased the book ""Study is Hard Work."" Unfortunately, the book did not live up to my expectations. There were not enough methods on HOW to accomplish what you need to succeed. There were certainly parts of it that were useful, but the majority contained no ""Aha"" moments or insightful clues as to how to get the most out of a subject. If it were reorganized or contained more diagrams or descriptions of how to study for each particular subject, it would be better. -LP"
positive,"Brief, entertaining intro to psychodrama: Highly readable, this little book explains the basic psychodrama concepts in an entertaining way. It's not a textbook for professionals, but provides a good overview of the technique."
negative,damaged disk-multiple: I have received THREE copies of Weeds Season Four and they were all damaged (particularly disk 2). Trying a different computer or DVD player provided no improvement. At this point I have given up trying to get a decent replacement.
positive,"This book is hilarious!: This book is a fine addition to the Dragonlance collection accomodating the humorous side of the series. Kenders and Gull Dwarves, Magic Users of good and evil alignment, and all in a very well written language and a wonderful tale.I think many people would enjoy this book as I did, I just couldnt stop laughing :)And if you do read the book, remember the following line: ""Him dead. Make good tale that."" Thats the base sentence of the book :P Hope you'll all enjoy this book, and laugh as much as I did,R.G.L.D."
positive,"Great Electric Sharpener for the Price: Sharpens pencils very well. May not be the fanciest or most durable on the market, but for regular wood pencils is excellent. Holds up well to use by my 7th graders."
positive,"Stephen King is back: It's nice to see Mr. King return to his roots. This novel was every bit as good as his earlier books. I found his charactes plausible, his storyline riveting and the conclusion weird but fasinating. Would highly recommend the book to anyone who like me who liked the earlier King novels."
negative,Stupid....: Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!
positive,I Loved the Movie: I absolutely enjoyed this movie considering I have seen it in it's different versions. The music and the story are put together beautifully that it makes the original Cinderella story look like a fantasy. This movie is the best version that I have viewed of the Cinderella saga.
negative,"Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story: I was so dissapointed with this i gave it away unlike the first two i wouldnt watch again, it had not one ounce of the magic the first two had! it was a total waste of time making it!"
negative,"Our hero, Ebenezer Scrooge: I agree with what Micheal Levin writes at a website called The Daily Objectivist, Scrooge was better at the beginning! He says: ""You know the ritual: boo the curmudgeon initially encountered in Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, then cheer the sweetie pie he becomes in the end. It's too bad no one notices that the curmudgeon had a point-quite a few points, in fact. There can be no arguing with Dickens's wish to show the spiritual advantages of love. But there was no need to make the object of his lesson an entrepreneur whose ideas and practices benefit his employees, society at large, and himself. Must such a man expect no fairer a fate than to die scorned and alone? Bah, I say. Humbug."" How could it be that an obscure website like The Daily Objectivist would have the most intelligent review of this book that I've ever seen?"
positive,"Great movie!: I thought this movie was great! Jennifer Love Hewitt is a very talented young actress, and this movie shows. All a movie could offer is offered here: a love tale, romance, humor, and great actors! GET THIS MOVIE!"
positive,"Great case, has slots for media cards but...: I've had this case for close to a year now and had no problems with it up until 2 months ago when I noticed one of the plastic hinges that attaches the Palm to the case snapped off, the remaining intact hinge has held up for about 2 months so far. The clasp has been fine and holds the case firmly shut, great access to all buttons and slots. I would have given it 5 stars but the hinge broke."
positive,"Action movie stays true to its Sci-Fi roots!: I, Robot, starring Will Smith, should be the shining example upon which Hollywood basis all of its Science Fiction films ripped from the pages of great authors.Although quite obviously given a generous helping of special effects, the producers managed to stay true to the overall tone and theme behind Asimov's stories.James Cromwell in particular is wonderful with his portrayal of the enigmatic scientist/hologram Dr. Alfred Lanning, adding the necessary elements of wonder and mystery to the concept of the spontaneous development of Artificial Intelligence."
negative,"Great for a SHORT TERM replacement...: I bought this to replace my 'falling apart' original charger. Worked like a charm for 3 months, then I found my computer dying on me. The charging signal would change frequently from charging to not etc.. I ordered a new battery, as i thought it was on its way out. I downloaded coconutbattery, and that explained all i needed it to. It showed the charger as connected, BUT not charging. I scrounged up my old charger, hooked it up, and sure enough, connected AND charging. It is without a doubt the macally charger. So i recommend it if you only plan on using it for 3 months or less. So not only am I out a charger, i ordered a battery for no reason."
negative,"Counterfit item - but works OK: According to the Motorola guide, the charger I received is a counterfit: It has a illuminated blue dot rather than a fully illuminated ""M"". It works OK, but should not be represented as made by Motorola."
positive,Underrated: This movie was actually pretty good. The brother of the psychotic Santa suit wearing killer goes loco and goes to a mental institution and escapes and kills people. The flashbacks were also very good and I especially enjoyed where he stuck the umbrella through the guy and then opened it.
negative,"NO EXTENDED CUT? NO SALE !: Total bummer. As a lot of people have said they won't be buying this and any future Ultimate Editions unless the Extended versions of each film are included and I agree with them. The first two HP films I purchased the Ultimate Editions mainly because the Extended Cuts were included along with the theatrical versions. Adding only a documentary is not reason enough to shell out 40 bucks or more for the same movie I already have on blu-ray.The first two Ultimate Editions are truly beautiful sets. The artwork and all the extras really make these collector's items for any fan of this series and I was looking forward to purchasing all the films (again) on blu-ray. However, as much as I'd love to have these now, without the Extended Cuts, makes all the difference.I hope someone at WB with enough clout sees this thread and hopefully some day soon we will be able to purchase THE truly ULTIMATE EDITIONS of ALL of the Harry Potter films."
positive,"Beautiful movie with a beautiful song: I heard Kenny Loggins version of ""The Last Unicorn"" a few years ago and couldn't figure out why it sounded so familiar. THen I remembered the movie I loved when I was younger. I saw it on the Disney channel last year. I love this movie and recommend it to anyone. Great story, great emotional content and...well...it's just great all around."
negative,"This Cadillac Records ain't the Chess Truth: As a piece of entertainment this movie may be OK. But why take REAL names of REAL people (some of them fortunately are still living) to tell a story which, for the most part, is completely inaccurate. Other reviewers have rightly pointed out the most blatant inaccuracies that this film carries. But as I have seen and met most of the artists involved in the plot (and for some of them - like Muddy who went dining at my home in Lyon (France) - I've had the fortune to know them personally) what worries me the most is that their personnality are also very inaccurate. For instance, Muddy who had an incredible charisma is portrayed here essentially as a very tepid character who thinks mostly to chase women. And Howlin' Wolf - a tough man certainly but a very bright and articulate one - is here portrayed as the terrorizing Wolf he PLAYED on stage and never out stage. The true story of the Chess saga (and the Chicago blues) is yet to be told properly"
negative,"Their worst effort, albeit with some interesting highlights: The only thing that saves this release is the collection of singles tacked onto the British release: ""I am the Walrus,"" ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""Penny Lane"" are great, but the actual soundtrack songs are weak as a whole. ""Blue Jay Way"" and ""Your Mother Should Know"" could come up missing from the Beatles' catalog and never be missed. ""Flying"" is a trippy instrumental that fits the feel of the LP, but is otherwise forgettable. Another of the singles included, ""Hello Goodbye,"" is one of the worst Beatles songs ever. Sure it's catchy, but it was a foreshadowing of the throwaways McCartney would come up with en masse during his solo years. Bad sign. The album is exactly like the movie - worth experiencing for a snapshot in the always interesting Beatles chronology, but their least-lasting work. Oh yeah - the title track is neato, if nothing else."
negative,"*yawn*: It seems that Auel was being paid by the word in this 5th book in her series. There is so much repetition and review that a fan of her previous books could skip pages at a time and not miss a single thing. Shallow characters, NO engrossing story lines or characture clashes, and not more than a glimpse of Ayla and Jondalar's new life together. Boring. Take out all the mindless erotica (that I skip anyway and always have), and about half of the flora and fauna descriptions, and every single recitation of the poem, and you will have a 100 page book to segway on to book number 6. I rushed to get one of the first hardback copies of this book. It was a waste of money and reading time. For the next addition to the series, I'll put my name on the waiting list at the library....if there even is one."
negative,"this series is really getting stale now: I absolutely adored book one, loved book three and quite liked two and four but I'm getting really bored now. The endless, endless repetitions of the stories of their journey, the constant reactions to the animals, the characters agonising over the same things again and again...... If you cut out about half of it, then it might be a good book, as it is.....don't waste your money"
negative,"How does stuff like this get published?: As with the Meade books, someone has to be kidding someone and doing something to someone for something to get this stuff into print. Really, why BS people about stuff that is boring and tiresome. Will St Martin Press give refunds while Mr Meade's connections get him another deal? I am sick of being suckered by your phony reviews."
negative,"Great while it lasted.: The Keurig was great while it lasted, but after about a year, my unit started to present all of the symptoms expressed in previous reviews. Troubleshooting alleviated most of the problems for a while, but then they progresively got worse until two weeks ago, when the unit totally failed. The unit will not power on at all.I researched the K-cup units for the past two weeks and they all get terrible reviews (Keurig, Cuisinart, Hamilton Beach, and Mr Coffee). The units all have various problems, including but not limited to failures, weak coffee, and temperature issues.I debated for some time about purchasing another K-cup unit and decided that they are not worth it (too much maintenance and expense (cost of unit, k-cups, and impact to the enviroment), so I purchased a drip coffee maker instead (Zojirushi Fresh Brew 10-Cup Thermal Coffee Maker), which got rave reviews.Now, what to do with my current K-cup inventory ..........."
negative,"Fisher-Price: My First Techno Album: What is the point of ever making this CD? I've had most of these songs for at least a year. Columbia, what are you thinking?"
negative,Please don't waste your money!!!!: I wish I had taken heed to the warnings before I purchased this phone in Feb. 2003... The battery life is the worst I've EVER seen! You probably get a good 10 mins. of talk time per charge...PLEASE DON'T BUY IT!!!!
positive,A Christmas Carol: I liked this book because the writer made a heart-warming story. Ebenezer Scrooge sure learned an important lesson. Alex Bailey
negative,"A waste of time and money: Good cast, high budget movie. The movie was supposed to concentrate on a group of 4 people (all insomniacs) who were going to stay in an isolated house, to test their reactions to pressure situations.Was it the lack of direction, the lack of story line, or the lack of interest from the actors that led this movie to become a flop ?Watching this movie was a chore. It was about as exciting as ""The Avengers"".There's not a lot that can be said, apart from save your money and get a better movie (The Sixth Sense was made on a cheaper budget & was far more exciting)."
positive,"This is Old Classic amd Great Sims: On Windows 98 this game was a dream to play. I had to use a joystick/game pad to get the tanks to move around better. It takes some doing and not getting yourself blow up all the time. This is multi tasking driving and you have to stop and shot and not do both like in modern tanks sims. Graphic is Ok and plain, you need a good eyes to spot the AT guns ready to pin you. Too bad they never updated it. I believe it runs on Win XP, but not sure about Windows Vista and Win7. I think you need a speical program to allow you play on those OS. Their are some around I use them. Too bad I love the old DOS and Win95/98 games. Which I could play all my old favorites. Thye were simple and easy to play like this one. Never get tired playing it."
positive,Can I Give This 10 Stars?: I will not go into great detail as many reviews already have it down pat!TiVo is AWESOME!You can setup recording to catch any episode or only set it to record the new episodes that are airing for the first time...You can even hook it up to the internet and put your shows on your laptop / ipod and watch them on the go.I give TiVo 10 out of 5 stars!You will not be disappointed!
positive,A Classic: Must Read! One of my favorite books. All of my sisters really loved it too! Very enjoyable for all ages.
negative,Not Working As Advertised: We purchased the so called Professional Stability Ball and it has leaked since we received it. The air inlet leaks and make the ball not functional.
positive,"great remake.: excellent remake better than the original in my opinion. All the same characters, Tony Todd was a perfect choice for Ben and the Cooper character is a bigger prick on this one than the original. Good story, very well done. I recommend this to zombie movie fans."
positive,"Great Price/Good Quality: I, too, purchased this CD player for my 8 year old daughter. I am really impressed with the sound quality for the price. If you plan to leave this player stationary (on a desk, etc.), I think you will be more then pleased. Also, it's an excellent gift for a young child, who doesn't need a top-of-the-line player. The price is VERY reasonable, and the unit is straightforward and easy to use."
negative,"Mr. Fix It is at it again: Just wonderful, Edgar. Yet another aesthetic cosmetology job on an early analog classic. Ignore these fix-up fiascos from Edgar W. Froese and stick with the original releases. While you're at it Edgar, why not do a touch up job on all the Tangerine Dream albums from the 70's?"
negative,"Great Story, Awful Video Quality: Loved this as a cartoon as a kid.Its still the same great story.But something was lost in the video quality when getting it on DVD. Its far too dark. Any scenes where its not bright sunshiny, are in effect black such that you can only see shadows on the screen (Riddles with Gollum, Giant Spiders, meeting Smaug in the Lower Hall). Its really unfortunate.Would not recommend."
positive,"A sucker for badness: Apparently I make up for the lesser group that likes this sort of shlocky action films that tie the occult to noir. I am not saying it's the greatest film ever made, but it seems to vibe with all of my likes. There are terrible moments to be sure mostly because Keanu can only project a sort of dazed reaction to everything. But who doesn't like a wise-cracking, gun toting, snarky jackass saving the world from Satan's reign once in a while ?"
positive,Great mount for my 40 inch LCD TV: We love this corner mount. It is plenty big enough and stong enough for our 40 inch Sony LCD TV. It's just what we needed!
positive,"One of the Best: This is definitely one of the best war movies ever made. I watch it every now and then when I think about the good old days when I used to play with my little Army men. Any war movie collection, or any collection, would not be complete without this wonderful movie. The book is also a great read and I have them both. I highly recommend it."
negative,"Do not spend your money on this vacuum: This is the first time i've had a Hoover that did not last more than 10 years at least. I use the vacuum twice a month on two area rugs, and that has been probable why they always lasted so long. When i received this vacuum the first time around had to return it because it did not work. This should've been enough warning not to get the same item again, but i was sold on the vacuum being bagless, the power, the retractable cord etc.,etc,etc.Well, one year and two days after the warranty expired it died, so it figures i used it about 24 times. I went online and followed all cleaning instructions, checking for any obstructions and still will not work. Tried to contact a Hoover service center, and was told that i had to bring the unit to their place and pay for any repairs (something between $25-$100)!!!!Bottom line, i threw it in the garbage and went back to the bagged machines again."
negative,"Never could get the bells to work right: I have some Woodstock bells for the patio, so I thought this would be great. It wasn't. No matter what I tried, I never could get the bells to go around and strike one another properly. I feel like this product was definitely not worth its price."
negative,van damn this was terible: This would be the worst van dam movie I ever seen not a good plot. I am used to so much more from van dam that this movie was disappointing
positive,"Welcome, Spike!: Why did Robert Parker give Sunny Randall (a daintier version of Spenser) her own book, other than to give Helen Hunt a job? The best character in this book by far is Spike, the gay restaurateur/tough guy. You have to love a man so comfortable with himself that when he's asked how he can bench-press 225 pounds, he nonchalantly replies, ""Fag power."" Parker could do amazing things with this character, but instead he relegates Spike to Hawk status. Don't get me wrong--Sunny's okay, but Spike's the reason I'll continue reading this series."
positive,"EPIC: This movie is great. Better than that, watching it on Amazon saved us from having to find copy somewhere. We watched Begins and Dark Knight the night and morning before we saw Dark Knight Rises. Awesome series!"
positive,"The best album I've ever heard: I can't understand why people like (WTS)MG? better. DM's got everything. It's simply amazing.The best songs, IMO, are Rock 'n' Roll Star, Live Forever, Supersonic, Cigarettes & Alcohol (so f***ing good) and Slide Away. They get 11 out of 10. The others 10 out of 10.If you're new to Oasis. Buy this album first. I promise that you won't be disappointed. Not if you appreciate good music."
negative,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The Which of Blackbird Pond was a very boring book. I almost fell asleep reading it! The plot was stupid. The charters were lame. This book was all around terribley written.
negative,"Stick to cooking, not politics: I wanted to like the book, I liked the movie and now I'm sorry I contributed so much as a penny to Ms. Powell. Like so many people, she seems to think that political comment is appropriate in any venue. Furthermore, she thinks that politically-based insults are appropriate in a book about cooking. Not. At least the movie people were bright enough not to insult a chunk of their audience.Take all of Ms. Powell's insulting generalizations about Republicans and change the word Republicans to Democrats or Jews or Catholics or African-Americans or Chinese and see how insulting they sound. Funny how changing the target of an insult seems to make it matter more, huh?At about the 12th gratuitous Republican insult, I tossed the book back into the box to return to the library and put Ms. Powell on my personal Do Not Read list."
positive,"Never more needed than today: Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and ""higher education"" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here's a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute."
positive,Dental Picks: These picks are wonderful. My 6 month dental checkups are great and I have very little plaque from using these several times a day.
negative,no good: I thought pampers were the best until I bought these. They are definitely economy. My son wet through them every time he slept. Size 2 should work fine for a 3 month old but these did not. I am back with huggies!
positive,"Brady Fan? Don't miss this!,: September 21, 2000""Brady Bunch home movies"" is an amazing look behind-the-scenes at one of the worlds best known, and loved TV shows. Robert Reed (Mike Brady) gave each of the ""Brady Kids"" a super 8mm video camera their first Christmas together. The kids spent the next 5 years (during breaks from filming The Brady Bunch) making their own home movies. This rare look at the entire cast and crew, along with early auditions, commercials and a ""where are they now"" segment, make ""Brady Bunch Home Movies"" a must in ANY Brady collection!"
negative,"like the doll, but that's it: Although the doll is great (like all Barbie - Kellie dolls) the jumpin castle was pretty much a waste of money. We really didn't get it to work right and, in the long run, my daughter just played with the doll. Unless you are buying it for the doll, I wouldn't recommend this one, just a waste of plastic here."
negative,Not Pleased: This dryer is not meant for ethnic hair. My hair doesn't get any straighter than it did using a regular blow dryer and brush. I wouldn't recommend it for women of color.
positive,"Kirov Sleeping Beauty (1964): Sizova and Soloviev, as well as Valery Panov as the Bluebird are wonderful. It's definitely worth buying, but many of the most famous dances have been shortened considerably in this video."
negative,"It doesnt work with Vista: The price was excellent but the standard shipping was very slow. It doesn't work with Vista, no drivers, so is useless to me. I gave it to my son and it works fine with Windows XP. My son has used it to scan pictures for me and it is of good quality."
positive,"Lady Gaga, eat your heart out: Based upon Depression-era original play, this incredible vehicle for the Legendary Mae West, is firmly planted in the disco seventies: even Rockmen Ringo Starr and Keith Moon seem at ease with the proceedings.A huge cast of past and present greats (with a terrific cameo by a lean and mean George Raft!) is featured in this wild story of the ultimate diva in a British Hotel, never quite finding time to consummate her marriage: the place is crawling with Diplomats (and ex-husbands). Will a cassette tape of her ""memoirs"" shake up the world?Along for the ride is the actor who played ""Mr. Pitt"" on Seinfeld.Fun soundtrack with mostly reworked conetmporary hits. Mae sings well, especially on ""After You've Gone"".By the way, Mae, at 85, is superb. If her illness at the time was an issue, it's not apparent in her many scenes; in fact, she dominates the film, delivering classic lines, throughout."
positive,"I Love this game: I don't have this game, but my bff has it and she let me play it, it was SOOO fun... She had to practicly take it away from me! I am getting one for my birthday and the nintendogs are on the top of my list (right under the nintendo ds) lol..."
negative,"Won't fit blues: I don't know what they used for a test truck, but it would not fit on mine. I followed the installation instructions and it just wasn't working out. I am a heavy DIY'er and have replaced many exhaust systems in my time. Dynomax needs to retest this system on my truck. The left tailpipe that crosses over from the muffler kept hitting the OEM muffler heat shield. The right side wasn't much better.Also I could not locate the tailpipe hanger holes in the frame as Dynomax install instructions said they supposed to be. After fighting with it for a while trying to make it work one way or another. I removed it and put it back into the box and sent it back.I have installed a few Dynomax systems on various vehicles with no problems at all. This one just didn't cut it.I purchased a Flowmaster single exhaust pipe system and installation was a piece of cake.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DYNOMAX #17313 FOR YOUR TRUCK.AMAZON'S return policy on this item is excellent."
negative,"This made me question my own faith in Christianity: I ""read"" this with my Sunday School Class (all over 30) to gain insight into our beliefs and found that I strongly disliked it. The man talks in circles, argues his case for atheism, attempts to sell Christianty but fails misberably. I would never recommend this book to a believer or non-believer. It is nothing short of jibberish."
positive,Good read: I really enjoyed this book. I'm always interested in learning about the Holy Spirit and this book was somewhat of an eye opener. I would definitely recommend it.
positive,"A Perfect 10: Completely captivating, WITHOUT A TRACE is one of the best books I have read this year. Jane's insecurity in her ability to help the victims of these horrific crimes is heart wrenching, as she struggles with her inner demons to help each witness/victim remember the minutest detail of a memory they just want to erase. Ray, tortured by his own nightmares, is a true doubting Thomas, but is perfectly portrayed as the dark, brooding hero needed for a romantic suspense.Secondary characters round out the story nicely, and Ms. Erickson's creativity allows evil to exude when the murdering rapist plays center stage. Once I picked up WITHOUT A TRACE, I never put it down until the last word was read. Strong, earthy characters, vivid imagery, and a suspense-filled plot, weld together to make WITHOUT A TRACE a top contender for best book of the year, and I am pleased to award it Romance Review Today's Perfect 10.Catherine McHenry"
negative,Nice but could have been better: Princeton Review's latest book on how to crack the SAT is quite good by giving us an accurate discription on how the problems are formatted and on what system they are laid out but in this process it fails to give many furthur execsice to practise. Hence we are short of practise but on the other hand Barrons book is one of the best I have ever come across. It is nicely and coherently laid out and quite systematically and enough practise skills.
positive,"Meticulous attention to historic detail and background: Seaman: The Dog Who Explored The West With Lewis & Clark is a wonderfully written, very highly recommended historical novel. Young readers will thrill to the story of an epic American saga showcased through Lewis' brave and loyal dog Seaman, the first dog to cross the continent and open up the west for the fledgling country of America. Author Gail Karwoski has given meticulous attention to historic detail and background, always the hallmark of a superior historical novel. She combines this with an impressive gift for storytelling that will engage young readers from first page to last. One special and unique feature is the Q & A format for the ""Author Notes"" at the end of this remarkable work."
negative,A pile of gravel: I hardly used them and they come apart at the seams and the gravel comes out. A waste of money. After using them maybe ten times I have to throw them away.I wish I had read all the reviews here of people that had exactly the same experience as I did! Hardly used and they already fall apart! Sometimes they already leak sand when they arrive!
positive,"The World`s Biggest, Greatest Classic R&B Album Ever...!!!: Simply a Masterpiece album, THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE, MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME. R.KELLY IS A MUSICAL GENIUS. HE PUTS ALL HIS HEART AND SOUL ON THIS CLASSIC. All the 19 songs are perfect blazing hot. But, my most heard are: Strip for You, Greatest Sex, I Don`t Mean It, Just Like That, Like a Real Freak, Don`t You Say No, ONE ME, I WISH & HIS REMIX, A WOMAN`S THREAT, I DECIDED, All I Really Want, FEELIN ON YO BOOTY AND THE STORM IS OVER NOW. As I said ALL ARE GEMS,ALMOST EVERY SONG COULD EASYLY BE A HIT SINGLE FO` SURE.BUY IT NOW. GET 3,4,5...COPIES IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY THAT COST. REMEMBER ALSO TO GET ""THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY"" ALBUM, I HEARD THAT IT WILL BE MAYBE THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR."
positive,"Happy Escapist: Call me an escapist, but I love this book. To accompany Mr. Pidgeon as he builds the Islander and sails her around the world, from one adventure to another, is a wonderful way to spend a snowy evening by the fire. He gives us a great glimpse into the flavors of the various south sea island groups in the early 20th century, where most cultures were dilluted already, but a few were intact. This book lets us see the world with wide eyed wonder through the eyes of a man with a thirst for knowledge and experience, and from the deck of a small boat."
positive,"Great Tool!: This is another great product put out by BOSTITCH! This gun has fired consistantly for me with no problems at all. I find that the features make this tool easy to work with and make on the job adjustments easy. The depth adjustment takes the frustration out of playing with your air pressure to get the correct depth as done with older tools. GREAT Product! Buy it, you will not be disappointed!"
negative,"Bellydance Magical Motion: I am a first-timer and it can be rather intimidating to admit for an older woman in her mid-forties! I wanted a video that was decent, and this one surely is. Atea's moves were clear and it helped me to get a good start, but I quickly became bored with it because it lacked FLOW, and I was disappointed that the moves that she so clearly shows do not connect together to form a dance routine. This is what I am looking for. For a beginner to be expected to make a dance out of a bunch of new moves is unrealistic, and I will continue to look for a video that will offer this. If I am to dance like this in front of my husband, (which is mainly why I am learning) I would not be able to show him a routine by learning this video because I am a beginner and don't know how to put the moves together yet. The whole idea is BellyDANCE, and not just Belly EXERCISE, and with the CONFIDENCE I need to dance this way!"
positive,IQ - Great live album: Not many reviews for this one so I thought I would talk it up. It is a great 2cd set with good sound that gives you a good mix of material. 4 songs from each album with Peter Nichols and a few from the Paul Menel years. Peter sings the Menel songs very good IMHO. This is a great prog rock album and if you haven't heard IQ before it is a good place to start.
positive,"Utterly captivating: This is the story of how Bilbo Baggins obtained the powerful ring and found sources of bravery and courage within himself through his adventures with the dwarves and Gandalf the wizard. I was spellbound within a few pages and was astounded at how energetic and compelling the story is. And this was published in 1937! I believe the reason for the book's longevity is that ""The Hobbit"" is about a character challenging himself and proving himself (to himself and to others), which is something to which everyone can relate. This is certainly a masterpiece of storytelling."
positive,Franklin-Green Knight: This is just another wonderful story in Franklin's life. Our two boys just love watching this DVD. It's complete and interesting to watch!! I would definitely recommend this if your child likes Franklin.
negative,Poor Quality: I got this fan February 11. It's April 29th and it's already squealing. I wouldn't mind so much except I spent more money in hopes that it would last longer. The fan is cheaply made...you just need to feel it to see that.
positive,"Great Movie: This is a great show, and I was happy to find it on Amazon to give as a gift to someone who also loves this classic Disney Cartoon. One of the best!"
negative,Discs are defective! Do not buy.: Warning! Do not buy this product. The discs are DEFECTIVE. Towards the end of the first movie - Conan the Destroyer - there is serious digital artifacting that ruins both the video and the sound and sometimes even stops the disc entirely. This has been the case with all three copies that I have purchased.
negative,"Film is fine, tape SUCKS: As other reviews have indicated, the film works just fine, stretches nice and clear, etc. but the tape is garbage. Do yourself a favor and just buy a roll of 3M double-sided tape if you're going to buy this kit."
positive,Great Price: Great movie to begin with and great price for the blu ray. Plays great and have had no problems with the case or disc.
negative,"Product is great, wrong amazon description.: This case was titled as a compact bow case for bow's 43"" long however at the time of purchase the description stated it would fit a 49"" bow. Fast shipping and technically sent the right case per title but was described incorrectly so I had to send it back and I bought it from Cabella's trusting their description."
negative,"Juvenille writing style.: After reading Jon Krakauer's book, I had to have more! Unfortunately, I choose Ruth Ann Kocour's book, which reads like an account of a life-threatening adventure as told by an adolescent. Although she is not a journalist, her recounting of conversations do not ring true and all the ""voices"" sound alike. And while I appreciated some insight into how bodily functions are handled on the mountain, a more mature attitude would have gone a long way."
negative,"Never Recieved: Ordered this charger and was told it was 1 month on backorder. Then, I never received it."
negative,"Extremely Disappointed: Was supposed to be a mid-weight thermal. It is a very thin, light weight material with no thermal/insulation capability that I could detect. Also, I'm 6'0"" with average arm length, ordered a Large, but the sleeves are at least 2"" too short. This product, as advertised, is garbage. Not like my old Thermastat Duofolds that I love, and hoped would be similar to this product."
negative,"3 years later, it is dead now.: On the back of this record player, it was manufactured in January of 2008 and now in October of 2011 it is dead. Pretty sure the belt just died on it.I had it set up to play through my computer speakers and as long as you have a decent system it should sound good. I played records on it quite often, but I still think it should've lasted more than 3 years. I also had the same issue other reviews stated about the bottom plate sticking up, but I just taped it down and that worked fine.Probably should just pay a little more for something a little better than this one."
negative,"Good Story - Bad Editing: I've really enjoyed reading the book, but the frequent spelling/word errors are starting to distract from my experience. At one point, Hawkfrost says he's Thunderclan instead of Riverclan... ugh... and various other grammar mistakes. Plus, the characterizations are beginning to run together. Oh.. and don't even get me started on things being mentioned that are completely ignored as though they are never said for books and books. At first, I put it off as: It's a book for kids... but good grief, dragging them out as far as they have and having characters acting inappropriate from what they've been told as though it never happened,... characters who have in the past been known to pay attention and dwell on such things...ugh. I'm going to finish this set of books, then that's it."
negative,Bad: It wasn't a good movie. It isn't for kids. The movie had a lot of things that didn't need to be show and played.
positive,"YSL Radiant Touch: I have been using this product for years, and it is far and away the best product I have ever found for under-eye brightening. I love it!"
positive,"Thank You!: I am sooooooooooo happy that this show is making its way to DVD. With so many other shows getting to DVD, its nice to see a true classic in stock. Plus, with season one being on DVD, I won't have to try to record the episodes on Nick at Nite every night (although I just might)."
negative,very disappointing!: As an avid reader of the horror genre and scary books I was disturbed that this was neither. One could not even classify this as a mystery or suspense. It is really utter nonsense. It is insulting for the author to claim that he is a trained investigator in any sense. Yet he willingly without any investigation gets involved in blood rituals and seances. Any expert in the occult has a healthy respect for the preternatural. Nany Drew would have done a better job on any one of the highly suspicious and improbable cases. This book should be geared for the 6 to 9 year old age group and unless they are camping alone in a cemetary at midnight on a full moon they would not belive or be scard. This book was a waste of money.
negative,"What's Up?: I'm mad as HELL. I waited for this Master Piece to happen and Evil is on back to back! That Sucks! I love the song but not twice in one sitting. Come On. NOT THE BANDS FAULT. Learn how to remaster music. If you can't do the job right GET OUT! YOU SHOULD BE FIRED, NO EXCUSE This is Unacceptable. Things like this really bug me."
negative,"MODDERS RUIN THE GAME!: You may think you are cool because you took the case off of your X-Box and (wow) followed a 6 step process to install your loser chip.But really you're just a cheater.Why are you playing?If you want to win games consider practice.It is a game.Once you start cheating now it's just a joke.Modding for the purpose of unlocking the xbox's media center functionality is one thing - that's fair use in my opinion, but modding to boost your rank is immature and ascinine.Why do you care what your rank is if you have such low regard for the game itself????"
positive,"wonderful car care kit: the wax smells good. The quick detail fluid does great job. If the price goes back to ~19, I'd like to buy another set."
negative,"laurin hill takes a second seat to Celine Dion: Celine Dion has put out the most memorable and sold CD of the 90's, states Billboard magazine but laurin hill should try to learn from superiors like Celine when it comes to making a Cd. i don't like hip hop and this didn't do any better. i recommend to buy Celine cd instead."
positive,"great price on a 18* hybrid: quality is high on this club as it looks really good and performs well also. the interchangeable weights and extra weights/ torx screw driver, pouch and headcover makes this package great.though a better shaft could have made this club a lot better."
positive,"Luther, VHS Version: I do not know the literal, detailed history of the life of Martin Luther, so cannot comment on the film's historical accuracy, one way or the other.Nevertheless, few films can offer historical justice to any person's life, and for history, I think, one should turn to literature, not film. The most I expect is relative historical accuracy, while capturing the significant character, objective character, of an individual's life.This was a lovely film presentation of good acting, music, photography, drama, heroic characters from history, at various points in the life of an important historical figure, during a dramatic, important time in history. Can't ask forLuther (2003)much more."
negative,"A disappointment: Maeve's forte is character development, dialogue, and interaction, and Silver Wedding was far below her usual standard."
positive,"Good choice for getting a vintage look: I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try."
positive,"Asimov demonstrates again that he has no peer in the area of explaining science: No one explains science better than Isaac Asimov, to most he was a science fiction writer, but his greatest contribution to the world was in explaining science to others. In this book, he fields a series of 100 science questions and gives detailed answers, even though each is only two pages in length. Some of the questions are:*) What are imaginary numbers?*) How many particles are there in the universe?*) Why do comets have tails?*) How will the Earth end?*) What is meant by curved space?*) What is the unified field theory?*) What's a breeder reactor?*) What is entropy?As a source for quick and complete answers to many of the common questions about science, this book is unequaled."
negative,"BUTCHERED CLASSIC: It's amazing how one cut can ruin a film. Well, here's the proof! I can understand why Barbra demanded her topless scene destroyed, but editing the 'F' word in a major key scene is unforgivable. This is a true classic comedy and a beautifully transferred DVD with its heart cut out! There oughta' be laws against this kind of hollywood butchery!"
negative,"A big let down: I bought this book for my research on my college thesis, which is about how the Faith-Based Initiative and Charitable Choice reflect a growing trend in government to privatize welfare services. I want my research to be fully informed by all the various differing voices in the debate over Charitable Choice, and thought that this book would yield thoughtful, intelligent analysis and discussion. I was sadly disappointed. This book is not meant to be a resource for any serious scholarly discussion, as I found it greatly oversimplified many of the topics it approached, and is written very much in a consumer-friendly fashion. If you are looking for a book that will lay out the basic positions of supporters of Charitable Choice and the Faith-Based Initiative, and a simple explanation of what Charitable Choice is, then this is the book for you. However, if you are looking for serious scholarly discussion, don't waste your money."
negative,Dumb movie: This was the biggest waste of time I have ever seen. The only person that would be interested in this movie is a thirteen-year old boy. Tyra Banks should stick to her day job. She is much better as a model for Victoria's Secret because she never has to open her mouth & speak. I want the wasted hour & a half of my life back. This movie was very predictable & lame. Don't waste your time.
positive,"One of Martin's best: An excellent acting job by Steve Martin, among his best. A funny movie that carries a needed message about judging one only on their physical attributes. Fun to watch with a pleasing yet surprising ending."
positive,"Classic book: This book is a classic. Interesting read and has so much more information that the movies. Great book for teenage girls who are interested how things ""used to be""."
positive,amazing deal: Three days after i clicked buy i had it in the mail. Package seemed like i got it from bestbuy! If you want this video in store bought conditions. He's your guy. Thanks for this. If i order anymore videos ill be sure to check here first
negative,"Looks more a less like an addvertisement for toys: This one looks like a childrens super hero atmosphere, because the writter of this one thought that kids would want to see it instead of grownups. Unfortunately this one was a box office flop."
negative,Praying for an Update: This program would not work with my high-speed computer. It needs a serious updating. I am disappointed.
positive,"Don't go into labour without watching this class!: The moment we watched this class, we knew, we didn't have to worry about childbirth anymore. 5 1/2 hours of essential information - and all the things we didn't know we didn't know! We became childbirth experts. Sheri, thank you for sharing this information in such an easy to understand and humorous way.."
negative,"Kubrick's Worst: ""A Clockwork Orange"" has some very interesting messages about criminal punishment, like who's really the victim when the victim wants revenge on the criminal who harmed him(when Mr. Alexander tortures Alex with Beethoven music in the locked house near the end) and what kind of control the government really has over the indiviudal (occuring when the doctors ""brainwash"" Alex). But, I can't believe this film is considered a masterpiece. Filled with scene after scene of rape and assault, and later, endless scenes of the criminal, Alex, wanting to be reformed and getting it at a high price. I think people only celebrate this movie because Stanley Kubrick directed it. I'm a fan of Kubrick, but I really think he wasted his time on this gloomy, moody piece of nonsense."
positive,"Metaphor Pedagogy Book: This book was awesome! It was a required read for my masters program, so I thought it would be boring like all of the other books that were required. It turned out to be a giant metaphor story with underlying relevant facts about teaching methods. I would read this book even if it was not required. The chapters were short, entertaining, and funny. A very easy read. If you are an educator or in the business of education you need to read this book. This was the only book that I did not sell back."
negative,"it insults your intellegence: A friend lent me this book while I was reading Bible for my class at UC Berkeley. I told him that I did not understand Christianity so he thought this book may help me. However, this book really makes me feel that Christianity is not an intellegent religion. It insults my intellegence by presenting arguments as a matter of fact. Although the book itself is not philisophical, it tries to convince readers that conservative Christian belief is the only possible explanation of the world. To achieve this goal, it showcases other philosophies and beliefs in a simplified and biased way and mocks them as nonsense while his whole viewpoint just sound stupid. The only value I see from this book is that it shows you what conservative Christians are thinking. You can get a sense of where they are coming from. However, if you are interested in Christianity with some depth, you should check out books like St Augustine's Confessions."
negative,Spend more money: The jacket is pretty small and was too tight around my neck. It totally bugged me just trying it on. There is no way I could have worn this all day kayaking. Returned it. Poorly made and really stiff and uncomfortable and way too small. Spent more money and got a Stohlquist instead.
positive,"A very informative and helpful read: I got this book, because I wanted to gain a greater understanding of Process Theism. I was familiar with free will theism, but certain aspects of it were troubling to me. While I find myself disagreeing with some of what process theologians have to say, it has been extremely helpful for me in clarifying my own viewpoint. I enjoyed the debate format that gave others a chance to respond and point out weak points and strong points in each of the articles."
negative,Nutri cal: Don 't buy if your pet likes vet nutri cal my puppy loves the vet one but hates this.Waste of money.
positive,"Only disposable that's ever worked for us!: I mostly use cloth diapers during the day, but for overnight and going out, I go with disposables. We're on our 3rd baby now, and over the years Pampers has been the ONLY disposable diaper that we can rely on! Have tried cheaper brands sometimes - they're cheaper for a reason! Pampers has consistently given us a diaper that we can count on not leaking. Store brands, Luvs, Huggies have all failed us multiple times, just leak really bad or tear easily. I am rarely brand-loyal, but Pampers is now the only brand of disposable I'll buy. Pampers is a good quality disposable for the times that you need it (I still recommend using mostly cloth and more natural products though!)"
negative,"Ok ore. I only got a pebl. Thi s ore is barley radioactive and ""cold"" at best: This ore isn't too active. It only has 433 counts a minuate. This a ripoff, double the price you can buy high grade uranium ore off of ebay that emits 130,000 counts This ore is barley radioactive. You can find watch hands more radioactive watch hands insted. [...]/ the ore here is a joke."
negative,"Disappointed...: I was disappointed in this movie. From the description, I thought it would be more comprehensive regarding Beau Brummell's rise to popularity in Regency England. It was more 'artistic'. I would not recommend."
positive,"I'm a believer!!!: I have been following the sculpting program for about six months and it has totally changed the way I look and feel about myself. I've lost a total of twenty three pounds, gone from a size 12 to a size 4, and for the first time in my life look toned and fit. It is an easy read and makes sense out of the topic without getting overly technical. If you want results, this is the one to buy."
positive,"Great Cable, Dirt Cheap: It's like getting the monster cables for two dollars. Who wouldn't buy it? I only gave it 4 stars because my gold tip on the cable was slightly bent and it caused it to crackle a bit when I first plugged it in. No problem, I then ordered another one just in case it broke, and the second one I ordered was perfect."
negative,Worst Quality: I wore this shirt just once. It's almost transparent. Not worth it even if you get it for free.
negative,"Worst diapers EVER!!!!!!!!: These diapers literally FALL APART at night. Even with my son who has a pretty servere case of urine reflux (not all his urine fliters out) and these diapers decingrate(sp) This morning I spend almost 30 minutes trying to clean off the little gel balls of the diaper material off my son and changing table!! So if you have a baby that can sleep through the night and you don't want to spend 30 minutes at the changing station, spend a couple extra dollars and buy the pampers extra protection, or HUGGIES!!!"
negative,"tea drinker: I had been having problems sleeping, and i saw this particular tea advertised in a magazine, ordered it right away online from the supplier, good price and fast shipping. No problem with the supplier at all. The tea does make one sleepy, but the overwhelming taste of licorice makes it hard to drink, and in reading the ingredients i see that licorice root is the first ingredient."
negative,can not hear a thing: this phone has great features only if you are not interested in hearing who you are talking to and don't want them to hear you clearly. the volume goes up to a level 5 and i need at least 2 more volume levels to hear most people. i'm 25 and not hard of hearing so you can see how this would be a problem. when i'm on the phone i have this weird look on my face b/c i'm trying to decipher what people are saying to me. do not get this phone unless you also want to purchase a whisper 2000 to go along with it.
negative,"What happened to Pitchshifter?: The Pitchshifter sound that has been forged over their last 5 or so releases, culminating wonderfully with ""www.pitchshifter.com"" has here been stripped to a watered-down sound that could have come from any of 1,000 other bands who are wasting our time (and money) these days. The Pitchshifter formula of brutal guitars mixed with programed drums and other industrial and electronic affects was unlike anything else on the musical scene. That sound is completely gone on this CD--reducing their punishing onslaught to something that MTV would have little problem broadcasting. A very disappointing CD."
negative,"Too much hype, not enough meat...: I was challenged to read this by a friend and thought it would bring up some intersting questions to debate. I was hugely disappointed with the quality of Paine's arguments. It was written before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and without the benefit of modern scholarship, so the arguments are antiquated. It is more of a rant than a scholarly essay on reason. It's probably something people should read simply because Paine is so well-respected, but I recommend something by William Lane Craig instead."
negative,"Raggae Mixed With Some Weird Techno: but man yeah yeah yeah its good and all that, but man, 9 dollars for three songs?! isn't that like an oxymoron?"
negative,"Paolini the copycat: Paolini obviously had no idea what he was doing when he wrote this book. All of his characters were simply copied from real masterpieces. Like The Lord of the Rings. I know not everyone can be as great as Tolkein, but if you're going to duplicate his work please try to at least put some of your own passion into the story. Real artists have their own way of thinking. Rowling,lewis,and Tolkein were the first authors of their kind and we should praise them not amatuers like Paolini. Thank You MaryAnn from Texas."
positive,"A ""Classic"".: Despite the ravages of time, Jules Verne's oddysey sails proudly onwards. The storyline is, for virtually the entire book, gripping and (with certain allowances, even now) almost believable. Characters are presented nicely, with a good amount of intrigue to boot. If aren't planning on reading this book, you deserve to go straight to Davy Jones' locker!!"
negative,"too much for me: I am an avid reader of many different types of literature, and am used alot of different styles of prose. Despite my past readings however I simply could not enjoy this book. It has a style all of itself. Perhaps other readers enjoyed this highly rated novel, but I did not care for the overall style and the excessive wordiness."
negative,"A Disappointment!: I had thought this would be full of dried fruits and nuts ( in other words, healthful) but it's really just sugar laddened bits of hard fruits and only flavorless peanut pieces. I have given the local food bank all but the one package I opened which made me feel so unwell that it's now in the rubbish. I am truly very disappointed in this product. It's description belies it's reality. If sugar is contraindicated in your diet....steer clear of this product!! It's low in salt and low in fat but so over sugared as to be actually nauseating. It's too bad because it sounded delicious and so nutritious. All I can say is YUK!!! I suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar is good for you."
negative,"Bleh!: Honestly, I'm shocked that this production has received such high praise. I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed. She just creeped me out.Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it."
negative,"Deceptive Pictures: The picture on the Amazon.com page is actually of two (2) of the products together. I was extremely dissapointed when I found out it was actually half of what I was expecting to receive, and for what I paid a high price. The toy may be durable, but it is DECEIVING to have a picture of 2 tunnels attached and sell only one...it's not fair!"
positive,"Lots of FUN!: I bought this ofr my neice, but all of the kids had a great time with this from 6 to 16 years old. I knew the product and was delighted I didn't have to wait in line to purchase it, I just pushed one button, no waiting!!! Yeah!! Nothing like buying known name brands and finding them AVAILABLE and AFFORDABLE!! Thank Amazon!!!"
negative,"So much potential, but one overwhelming problem: On paper, this recorder seemed to be perfect for my needs - primarily scheduled recordings of TV programs. In addition to the normal specs for these devices, I particularly liked the commercial skip, its low standby power level, and its 5-year battery backup.But the TV Guide is truly a deal-breaker. In the week I had my unit, it literally chattered continuously as it tried (with only partial success) to download the guide. It was very irritating in an otherwise quiet room, and quiet passages in music or TV programs are a thing of the past with this in the same room.I emailed Pioneer; they said it is normal for the unit ""to make some sound"" when it is on, and the TV Guide cannot be disabled.If it worked well, the TV guide would be nice, but it isn't worth the racket. If I could have disabled the TV Guide, I would have kept the unit and programmed it manually.I reluctantly returned the recorder."
positive,"Connie Francis Sings Spanish: I really enjoyed Connie's versions of Latin hits! There are only two singers/entertainers who really sing with their heart and mean it, and that it Connie Francis and Vikki Carr. Let's see a compilation album by the two artists together. Both of these superstars are still touring and have the fan base. I also hear that Vikki Carr is still winning Grammys even in the mid 90's! Let's get them together on CD!!! We still love you Connie!"
positive,"Guardian Heroes 2 vs. Sega Saturn guardian Heroes: All in all this game is amazing!!!I'm sure all yuo old school sega fans out there know what I'm talking about. The ground breaking genre defining Guardian Heroes!orgionally, the first Guardian Hero game came out on the legendary sega saturn and there was and still is nothing like it. If you haven't played the first one then your out of luck because it's sold out(lucky me, I have a copy ^_^)The story may be confusing if you missed out on the first GH because the people who are being assimilated into the main character are actually from the first game! It was a bit sad to know that they've all died, but it was absolutely a must for the developing storyline.If you've played the first one I'm sure you'll agree the way the story goes is PERFECT! I wish I could give this game 10 stars...Long Live Prince Valgar!!!"
negative,"Not great, not horrible: Let's face it: this is a children's novel. It's designed for children to read and think they're reading an adult novel without realizing that that's what they're supposed to think.The problem is, the language and the way they talk may make it hard for children to get through. Basically, Treasure Island has lost its target audience.However, it is still a cute adventure romp that has inspired many of its kind (with or without Johnny Depp). Read it as a classic, not anything else."
negative,"Don't waste your money: The ""training guide"" covers the high points on the exams. If you already know everything the exams cover then this book would help pull it all together for you. But by no means does it ""offer(s) complete preparation for taking and passing the Microsoft Certified Professional Exams 70-160 and 70-161,"" as it claims on the back cover. That is pretty much a bunch of BS. I passed 160 today and am taking 161 tomorrow. I would say this about where my knowledge came from:40% Experience programming in VB and Access35% MSDN readings (mostly on stuff I had heard of but not used)20% Transcender tests (make me aware of stuff I haven't heard of)5% MS Press Training Guide. (I needed the numbers to add up to a hundred<G>)Just my two cents, but I think your money is best spent on MSDN and Transcender."
negative,"Fair: If you already have a book on volume, you can skip this one.I bought this because I saw the good reviews on it.Maybe because the book was written in 1931. A lot of information in this book is already available on the internet or other books on volume.Basic stuff."
negative,"Vanessa is...: One of the WORST vocalists out there today. I can't think of a more irritating ""singer"" than Ms. Carlton. Thankfully her latest CD bombed so hopefully I won't have to be subjected to her pre-school-like vocals."
negative,"Fragile: This is a cute little gadget, but it got broken after only three months of carrying it in my pocket. Seems to be too fragile for being a mobile player."
positive,"Good but long: Our 2-year-old loves Franklin, but got a little bored with this because of the length (75 minutes.) When you're used to those bite-size 15-minute Franklin stories, this was a LONG one -- we has to stop it and continue later. However, it's a cute story, and especially useful since we are expecting another child just like Franklin's family, so we will use this tape as one way of preparing our son. It's a little strange to see Franklin and gang doing song-and-dance, I have to admit. And I missed the toe-tapping ""Hey, it's Franklin"" at the beginning!"
positive,"MOTHER NIGHT, the ultimate in life's paradox set in WWII: ""Mother Night"" is one of those books that is hard to put down. The main character and his life as a playwrite is excellently done by Vonnegut, with his usual twists, turns, and sudden revelations. This book is a must to read!"
negative,"the paper is of very low quality: My daughter is very disappointed with this coloring book.The paper is very dark, ruff and thin. It absorbs the ink so fast, that it is almost impossible to color using markers, you can only use crayons.The price is high and the quality is low - not a good product.The Pictures are nice, though."
negative,"Not for walking on rocks!: These shoes seem to be constructed well and I like how they look, but there just is not enough cushion on the sole. Walking on rocks under the water (or on the way to the water) hurts almost as much as going barefoot. They're fine for walking on sand, but that's it!"
negative,The precision system of contract bridge bidding: I have been using this system of bidding for ten years. I have played with a foursome using this system for these ten years. We have entered some local duplicate tournements and have never finished worse than second. The local directors do not like us to use Precision bidding and have tried to outlaw it or prevent us from playing.
positive,Story of The YARDBIRDS: Excellant DVD. Had a lot of info I didn't know about the band. Highly recommended.
negative,"Couldn't put the other 4 down...can't pick this one up...: Talk about mind-numbing drivel, I could have waited another 10 years for this one. Does little to further the story and is mostly a cliff notes summary of the last 4 books. But for your hard earned cash you'll at least get to read over 100 pages describing the appearance of cave/rock formations...I've read college textbooks that were more entertaining...It's taken me several months but out of respect for Auel's earlier books I've almost managed to finish this one...It does make a great paperweight though..."
positive,"Perfect: This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt! Their first game is tomorrow, can't wait to see him play in it. Fits a perfectly. We bought a large."
positive,"Heavy Duty Mobile Power: I use this not only as an emergency back up, but also for powering small tools when doing yard work. It saves me from having to figure out how to run an extension cord around the house when I want to do some pruning with my reciprocating saw."
negative,"unvoluntarily ridiculous: Keep your hands of this movie, it definitley aint worth watching.The story is thinner than a crack ho on her last day on earth, unvoluntarily ridiculous and so placatively wanna-be-patriotic that homeland security shines outta your butt when ya bother watching this crappy movie.One of the worst movies i ve seen in years."
positive,One of the nicest products out there!!!: I just purchased a new digital camera and was looking for a CF reader when I stumped on Dazzle DM-8400 6 in 1 reader. I have a laptop with Win XP Pro and a desktop with Win 2000 Pro. This reader works like a charm on both platforms. Additionaly it uses the USB port and does not require an extra power source and is easy to carry as well.I also used the provided software to burn a CD that I can play on my DVD player. Now I can share my pictures with my friends on a big screen with good quality pictures. All in all this is the only product I have seen out there that supports so many multimedia formats under one hood.I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good product with a reasonable price and so many features.
negative,"Way Too Small!: Do not ignore the previous posters complaints about the size of these weights. I did! I'm a woman with a wrist 6.75 inches in diameter and I wear a size 7 or medium glove. These weights are extremely hard to get on and very uncomfortable to wear. I really think they are only suitable for a child or a very, very small woman.Also the weights I received do not look like the pictured item. Valeo seems to have changed the entire design of these. Maybe they were better before? The pictured item seems to have a larger diameter in the opening. The ones I got desperately need some elastic or something."
negative,"Buddy: I hate to say it,but for the 1st time ever I am severely disappointed in something connected with Ry Cooder.Musically,it sounds like so much hillbilly and not at all what I have come to expect from an artist whom I have admired for decades.I bought the album unheard,purely on past experiences,but sadly did not enjoy it at all."
positive,"Off to sea with Jack Aubrey: Such a trip - When you want to get away from the darn dailys and live a little in your imagination, this is a book to pick up. Besides, the language is charming, as are the characters, and a bit of a challenge. All the words are compatible with nineteenth century English; sailors' language is a new area for expertise; and all the words are precise and in the right places."
negative,"There is no insight to be gained after finishing this book.: It is absolutely unbelievable this woman IS a therapist, by reading her book, she NEEDS one. She relates to clay more than to children or people. Whatever she was looking for in an Amish community, she never found it and translates that to the reader. Don't waste your time with this very poor read."
negative,"Sheer Stupidity in putting this package together.: Was someone asleep when they put this set together? Not only does the promo at the beginning of Disc 1 list ""Little Drummer Boy-book II"" as being part of the set, it's nowhere to be found on the package. Second, Disc 2 is a write off-having a completely different film by the same name as ""The Year Without A Santa Claus"" in place of the Rankin/Bass classic. With it's absence, you also lose the other features on that disc - namely ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" and ""Nestor, the Long Eared Christmas Donkey"". Thankfully, I do have those elsewhere, but I did buy this with the understanding that it would have ""Little Drummer Boy-Book II, and it's not there. Never in my life have I seen such a sloppy Video or audio package. This could have been a 5 star set if everything had been as advertised."
negative,"ABRIDGED!!: Nowhere in the description of this item or in the book itself does it mention that this is an abridged book with a number of plot resolving sections omitted. Amazon - you must state in the listing for these ""Enriched Classics"" books that they are abridged and therefore are useless as school books, etc. Very misleading by the publisher!"
positive,Ingrid Berman is a joy to watch....: Charles Boyer is the handsome rogue and Ingrid is just so beautiful that you will want to see her in every second of this wonderful classic.
positive,"Shakespearean: A very raw movie on the powerful role in people's lives of emotional dependencies on others, on how those dependencies develop and on how these higher in a relationship hierarchy exploit the dependencies for manipulation. The drama of the dependencies is underscored with sex and murder. The movie brings to mind Shakespearean plays such as Hamlet or better Titus Andronicus (no, not in the Julie Taymor edition). I actually ran across this movie in France."
negative,MArtini Glasses: was very disappointed when the glasses came broken did not even get to enjoy the use of the for the party that they were originally purchased for
positive,"A second purchase for me: I never knew there was any flavoring like this until I saw it listed here at Amazon. I love these tablets and carry a tin with me in my purse (no larger than a tin of mints) so that I can have Hazelnut coffee when I am out. I also use these when I only want one cup of decaf coffee and make instant coffee. I like the flavor tablets because it doesn't diminish the coffee taste, dissolves easily and has very little sweetness to them. I can add Splenda easily. It is getting harder and harder to find Hazelnut coffee for a regular coffee pot or in instant form. The recommendations are for using one tablet but I always use two. If I am going to make iced coffee I have an extra large mug that I use and use three tablets instead.I was so pleased to find these on Amazon."
positive,"Good protection from sticky fingers: Overall, I like the protector. Other people have said it protects the keyboard from spills. While I can't vouch for that particular capability, I do think it protects the keys from sticky fingers. I like how it feels over the keys, too. I definitely would recommend this product."
negative,Violent and Exploitive.: Extremely violent horror/thriller about pretty young woman travelling to an island only to be beaten and raped by a gang of young holigans. Terrible film is banned in most countries and is an absolute abomination. Don't waste your time or money.
negative,Talk about an inaccurate picture!: The stone was far larger and the band far thinner than depicted. I opened the box and was very disappointed with what I found.
negative,"Charges on the cheap, or not: It's a little bigger and bulkier than an SNES game cartridge. It's about the weight of a shoe. I tested it on my Zune 30 and my friend's iTouch 8gb. It didn't charge the iTouch at all, so don't count on that. It charged my Zune, but took pretty much two of these using the USB charging outlet to charge it from completely empty (non-functioning) to completely full (green battery icon). I plugged in my Zune AC wall charger into the pocket power AC outlet and had a little more success. It didn't quite take two. It didn't charge my laptop.I gave it two stars based on the Amazon price. I got two for $15, and would give it three based on that. I guess I can only recommend this if you find two really cheap and you have a Zune."
positive,"Pure Neil: This is a light, dark, introspective tour through the mind of Neil contemplating his mortality. It's an image-filled attic that takes you for a great ride. Lots of good cuts, some pure inspiration, and minimal filler material. If you love the way Neil's mind works, Prairie Wind provides more of the picture. Some great sounds, too!"
positive,"Customers Service!!!: I have spent thousands of dollar's, On Meyers cookware everthing from KitchenAid, Anolon, Prestige, Faberware, & Circulan, just to name a few. Though Meyers does manufacture very high quality pots & pans and I would recommend them to anyone it's just sad that if you have any problem with them, under warranty, you have to go throught the chain of command, that never gets you anywhere, even if you want to speak with upper management about the rudeness of the customer service department. Their customer service department employees are always very rude and snotty and they act like they are doing you a favor to even talk to you about their products. Don't get me wrong they do make good cookware, probably the best, but you as the consumer are at the mercy of their customer service and their descision or your fait on wheather your life time warranty is honored or not."
positive,Good book: This book is a very good sequel to the other warriors books. People of any age should buy and read all the warrior cats books.
positive,"A Good Fun Guide to Swedish: I actually purchased this book a few years ago. As a high school student into Swedish culture, I bought this book because it looked fun and easy to read. I was very impressed with this pocket sized text.I felt as though I started learning Swedish right away. I learned my phone number, days of the week and greetings. I taught my friends. They all borrowed the book.I went to Sweden and Finland about a year later. I found it useful. It is not the be all and end all of the Swedish language by any means, but I loved it. I do wish it had an audio tape.I lost the book recently and I have decided to repurchase the same book because I have found none better for the price and quick information it provided."
negative,"big name - low rating: I purchased the 350 wireless adapter as a second adaptor for a second laptop on my wireless LAN. My first laptop has a Compaq WL110 PCMCIA adaptor which out performs the Cisco hands down on range and connectivity. The Cisco comes with some fancy disgnostic tools which states signal to noise ratios with no loss whereas a simple ping test clearly displays packet loss. I am disappointed as a IT proffessional and someone who thought that a cisco card would be the best. Not the case, buy Compaq or 3com."
positive,"There's a little witch in everyone: Being the odd one out in a community is not a new problem but when you've got a family history like the Owens' it's the most likely outcome. For Sally and Gillian the family secret- the power of the super-natural/ witchcraft has lead to a lonely life, but they overcome all problems. The story of Practical Magic follows the lives of two sisters on their paths of life but always in the background their aunts keep a watchful eye. The story follows their love for eachother and for the men in their lives but in the back of the story is the idea of a family cursed throughout the generations. I would give this book top marks; it is the type of book that you could read over and over again and never tire of it. ""Keep rosemary by your garden gate; Plant lavender for luck; And fall in love whenever you can."""
negative,"The book is wonderful, but the Kindle version full of errors: I love this book (I have read it before) and thought I would get it on Kindle since it is one of my favorites. Unfortunately the Kindle version must have been slapped quickly into digital format via optical character reader or something similar, with no quality check done on it. It is full of typos that would have been easily caught with a simple spellcheck, for example instead of the word ""call"" it said ""cal:"" There are numerous examples of this and it is very distracting."
negative,"Piece of junk: I have four of the outdoor units that are as good as a paperweight. At over $200 a piece, I've wasted over $800 on these. Don't waste your money. I've never wrote a review on any product before, and I've bought a lot of things off of Amazon, but these are the worse items that I've ever bought. Avoid at all cost."
positive,Very pretty and good quality: My two year absolutely loves puzzles and this has been a great addition to our collection.. It's sturdy and I don't think she'll be able to wear it out or break it.
positive,"One of my top 10 movies of all time: I just loved this movie - I have seen this so many times and still find myself completely in love with Nicholas Cage and his tormented, passionate demeanor in this flick. He and Cher light up the screen and you find yourself wanting more at the end. Another hopeless romantic film that you just can't get enough of."
positive,"Great Video: This is the best video he has done since ""Here's your sign."" I would recommend this video to everyone I know."
positive,"Mother Vonnegut: An interesting--almost crazy--ride through the later years of Howard Campbell, American-born, German playwright-turned-Nazi-broadcast propogandist, then-re-turned-American-spy.Vonnegut once said, humbly, his writing was just 8 to 10-line jokes strung together. There is slapstick and farce here; great fun and entertainiment. What saves this from craziness is Vonnegut's ability to write so well about noble things such as love and kindness, friendship and decency. So one laughs and one thinks and one feels as he reads here. . .and in almost everything else Kurt Vonnegut wrote."
negative,"truly truly awful....: if pre-fab singers like britney spears, mariah carey and the backstreet boys were thrown in a studio and given a bunch of instruments and told to record, the end result would sound something like this."
negative,"Sometimes the classics can be boring: Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep."
positive,"Well Written!!: I found the book impressive even before I knew the age of the author!From the onset I found myself embedded in a rich and sense-stimulating world...I could ""see"" the movie already. ;)The was a little borrowing of what you could call our ""common knowledge"" (courtesy of Tolkien) of the ways of elves, dwarves, and evil creatures but the writing is descriptive and expressive and the story quite exciting!My sons and I are getting ready to read the next installment and want to thank Master Paolini for giving us good fantasy fare!"
positive,I would read this book: This can make you feel how like you are growing up and you got to do what you got to do.
positive,Gives me chills: I don't think this story really needs my review. So many people have already said everything that needs to be said. All I can say is when I was done with reading this story I felt a trembling deep inside of myself that never fully went away. There is a terrible truth here that needs to be seen.
positive,"110% Fun: Folks, if you say bad things about a movie like this, you need to get a life. This is what we call a ""popcorn movie"". It's in theaters in the summer, when most people are off from school and are on vacation. That means they want to have FUN.F.....U.....NAnd that's EXACTLY what this movie does. It's thrilling, it's exciting, funny, scary, and fun. It's bigger, better, and louder.And the best part: the kid is NOT annoying!! Like anyone, I hate when a movie is ruined by a kid actor (SW: Phantom Menace), but this kid is an exception. HE should've been in the last SW.If you like The Mummy, you'll LOVE The Mummy Returns. If not, get a life and stop being so critical. It's a MOVIE, not a political statement."
positive,"Books-Tapes2: I chose this author Joe Gores, because his books are interesting and do not have lude remarks or many ugly words."
positive,"kids need to read: Anything to make children read is a good for the mind, heart and and soul. Reading will help with other things in life."
positive,"good, not great: I ordered this after my milk supply had dropped. My daughter was 7 months old at the time. It tastes terrible, but I did see an increase in my pumping sessions by at least 2oz each time. I am currently not using it, but will take it again if I need to."
negative,"boring and dragged out: I usually read a historical romance novel in 2 days. Long, boring and drawn out!!!!! This is the first of Medeiros books for me and the last!!!!"
negative,"boring: This is a boring polemic that provides absolutely no insight into actually existing models of state repression. In any case, everybody's moved over to the American model, so Orwell's scrawlings would do well to stick around on their crusty little island."
negative,"For those who like to appear well read: In the grand list of books that you will have enjoyed having read, this one ranks slightly above ""Tom and Jane Go to Camp"".Now, I'm not going to say that this book was trite, boring, lacking in substance or otherwise devoid of anything resembling redeeming merit, because it does have its purpose. That purpose being to sit on your shelf and make it appear as though you are some kind of eruditic masochist.If, like me, you were forced to read this book as some sophomore hazing ritual, you will no doubt remember that this book contains very little in the way of plot and character development. The characters don't so much grow as fester.I would not recommend this book to anybody, even those that I hate. People who have suicidal tendencies are warned to stay away as the most cheery portion of this book is slightly happier than a crushed puppy.In closing, let me just summarize: this book is bad."
negative,"The Castle in the Attic: i read the castle in the attic and i thoght it wasn't very entrtaning. but that's just my opinion. i thought on some of the chapters it dragged on and lost me alot. like it would talk about one thing and then another without alot of detail. for my opinion, it was an ok book. it had it's moments like whats going to happen next then it was really boring."
positive,"Uncovering the rage about Bettie Page: After years of seclusion, most of the secrets of, by and about Bettie Page are revealed in this well-composed and long overdue profile of the most photographed model in history.Ms. Page may still wonder at the inspiration and sensation (and consternation from members of Congress) she caused in the mid-1950's...what this book clearly does, is testify as to why her image is still sought after by fans and collectors.Easy, lively reading and plenty of pictures rates this as the best book available on the Page rage."
positive,"Gorgeous and reliable: I've owned this ball about 6 weeks now and I use it as my desk ""chair"". The wonderful dark purple color looks great in my office and it was very easy to blow up with the included pump. Durable so far--I've taken it to a weekend training and back with no problems and after the initial ""breaking in"" period, I've only had to add air once--as I expected. I am very sensitive, but detected little or no odor when I opened the package. My only suggestion to the manufacturer is that they include a plastic tool to ease out the stopper. I had one from a previous ball and it works more easily than a coin."
positive,A great investment!!!!: I love this show! The soundtrack really brings the best music in the show. It is also very comforting to listen to! This is a must buy! Don't miss this great opportunity to add it to your music collection!!!!!
positive,"Good for experienced c/s developer who wants to switch to VB: This is an excellent book for experienced client/server developer. Author identified new concepts of database connectivity in VB6 and future trend. Reader who uses other database tools such as ""PowerBuilder"" will find this book useful if he or she wants to switch to VB6. It would be better if author gives more ""step by step"" instructions. This book is not recommended for new c/s developer."
negative,"Flatout is flat: This game has some good qualities, but the pure racing person will have issues, as you gain $ for running into objects and cars, which blows. You are in a race and losing, so blast your car and everyone around you to get $$ for the next race. Realistic? Not. They don't even have a view from inside the car, it is a bumper view with no part of the car visible. The interface with arrow buttons is bad, and you can't even race online, just by LAN. In short, stick with Leadfoot or DTRSC and you will be at least $40 better off.jc"
negative,"I hate the iluv: . Having read other reviews of the iluv, I figured, under $40, it's worth a try. It does work but the sound quality is terrible. My advice is, buy a hardwired adapter kit or wait until you have a car with the capability to directly plug in an ipod or other mp3 player."
positive,"Almost as good as live: Having seen this production a dozen times or more live, I can say nothing beats a live performance, but this tries to come close. A nice take on the stage version and you can't beat the unforgettable tunes and sassy, creative lyrics. Joseph is an underrated ALW peice. Donny Osmond still makes it as Joseph in this production, tho he's teetering on the edge of age here. WHO cast Dynasty Diva as Potiphar's wife?!?!?! WRONG."
positive,"Worst music ever....but I love it.: I don't know if you can actually call this music. It is truly terrible. However, I love listening to it for some strange music. ... I am not normally a fan of rap music, but I laugh out loud every time I hear some of these songs. These Cash Money guys should be comedians. Except for Juvenile, since I can't understand anything he says, which is also rather funny. Don't buy it for the music, but it for the comedy."
negative,"Plzz don't buy it: Review: I have had the sansa view 8gb for a year before the navightional wheel didnt work any more.(Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining) I dont think so! im a person left musicless.( aawwww )Pros: the wheel lights up.Cons: the wheelConcluction: dont buy it!, dont !, wait one more time, DONT BUY IT !Recommendations: I personaly recommend buying an archos product, nuff said. :["
positive,Truly a classic: Great read. Good book to be read by young and old. Be prepared for a hard read in the beginning due to the old style wording but Tolkien is a master at detail makes you feel as if you are there
negative,"Spiderman 2: Not a very good movie. The story is slow choppy, and hard to follow. It is no way as good as the first one.My lady movie critic and I give i two thumbs down."
negative,"John's Story: Was the author trying to emitate The Left Behine Seris? It sure did miss a lot of detail. I can forgive some typos, but this e-book just had way to many."
positive,"Was a gift: The book arrived in great shape and on time. It was a gift, so I'm not sure of anything else related to the contents of the book, or if it was helpful to the person who received it as a gift."
positive,"So interesting it's worth a novel.: When I saw the book Clipperton in the display window of a New York book store I had already been planning to write a novel about this strange island. With the additional information the book provided my plans became more concrete then. After a decade and many many rejection letters I finally found a publisher in Harbor House, Augusta, Georgia. The novel will be published in the fall of 2006. Thanks to Jimmy Skaggs; his book is interesting and well documented. A find for island lovers.Karl Berger M. D."
positive,"Seiltanzertraum: If you have lived in Germany, you would have heard about PUR. Their music is catchy with great lyrics and very easy to listen to - even my children (young and do not speak German) love the music. You do not have to understand a word of German to enjoy this CD and any one of their CD's. Best track in my opinion on this CD has got to be "" Hor Gut Zu"""
positive,"Dune (40th anniversary edition): I found to be excelent. I remember reading this years ago and the story is still facinating. Reading on the Kindle FIre was very nice and portable, and you do not lose your place."
negative,"go somewhere else: You can buy these cheaper at the babiesareus store (with mail/email coupons) Product itself is good, I am a pampers brand mom."
positive,"A good, quick and basic intro to management: This is a good book for first-time managers. It's short, quick and to the point. The biggest benefit is showing that reprimands and praise deserve equal time. Employees don't grow if they don't make mistakes, and some of the greatest learning opportunities come from reprimands followed by encouragement.Since the whole books takes about an hour to read, it's well worth your time."
positive,Great Book!: Great Book! Great Series! The action and story telling make it a real page turner! May your swords stay sharp!
negative,"Disappointing!: I slogged through this book, waiting, hoping for it to get good...there are brief flashes of wit, but I can't get around the author's vulgar language and hateful outlook on life. What a bummer!Thankful I picked this one up at the library instead of wasting money on it. If you must read it, I suggest you do the same."
positive,"A wide collection that consistently remains true to the heart.: It can be difficult to find a fairy tale collection that manages to hit on a wider spectrum of stories, rather than the hish-hash collections of everything that everyone has memorized or the collections that go out of the way to find the most unknown and unusual. This has both, from the familiar to the distinctly different, and told in a classic Victorian voice. There is a story for everyone here, romantic, macabre, and even funny, and from a variety of countries and cultures. It's a good, basic show of different types of stories, and each one is memorable! Defintely a must-have for the fairy tale collector!"
positive,"Very Funny: Movie was great, arrived on time and in excellent condition. I will do business with this seller again."
positive,"Great Quality at a Great Price: We recently moved and I found myself needing a couple of end tables but unwilling to pay a big price. I ordered two of these, not really expecting much other than to serve the intended purpose. Imagine my surprise when they turned out to be exception quality, substantial wood tables and not the pressed board stuff. Amazing value. I would buy any product this company offers."
negative,"Did not hold air. I have to return it!: This looked like a good produce and inflated easily, but would not hold the air. I am very upset that in returning, I will not get full refund for this defective product! There will be a restocking charge, which is rediculous because they can't sell a defective product!"
positive,What Every Woman Should Know About Divorce and Custody:: This book was a god send. It helped me with so many issues. I found it to be a true survival guide with advice that works. I purchased the book months ago when I was first separated. Now my ordeal is almost over but I still keep the book by my nightstand and refer to it constantly.
positive,"great 4 hiking: The ""Fours"" recently purchased are just as comfortable and supportive,right of the box-as were my two previous ""Fours"". My first pair just wore out after four years of constant hiking. Unfortunately, the second pair, after two years of Catskill hiking lost its waterproofing ability but I believe that was so because of a seam opening between the uppers and sole; it has however remained my fair-weather hiking boot. My newest""Fours"" are terrific. I had to get them in second choice,black. I'll get used to them."
negative,"MIght order................: .......... if you posted the dimensions, if you posted the dimensions, if you posted the dimensions, if you posted the dimensions, if you posted the dimensions, if you posted the dimensions"
positive,"Perfect: Not at all heavy - but not flimsy either - so they're really comfortable to wear. Well made, very shiny. The moldavite could be taken for peridot, it's paler than the photo. Really cute earrings and fantastic value for money."
negative,Limited help.: The book covers J2EE 1.3 security with hello-world level security examples beyond I find nothing but an introductory Java Security API guide. The chapters also lack details on when and where you should use these APIs. I bought this book before 'Core Security Patterns' by Christopher Steel that is much more helpful and example driven than this book.
positive,Excellent book for exam as well as reference: This book is explains web application development and configuration using Servlet and JSP technologies of Java. I found custom Tag development a kind of difficult before I read both the chapters on custom Tags in this book. Really helps to clear the fundamentals of web development using java technologies. Comes with excellent test simulator CD.
positive,fort apache: John Wayne movies are the best.And with John Ford directing it's even more of a blockbuster.And Henry Fonda and Shirley Temple are great too.
negative,"Did Faulkner care?: I had to read and re-read numerous sections of this book hoping to understand what Faulkner was getting at with this story and sadly, I never did get it. I knew that this was going to be a difficult book but not to the point that it discourages a person to never want to pick up another book. Faulkner's language and structure was not beautiful but forced and didn't seem to come natural like it had for me in his other works. There were times when I was reading when I thought that Faulkner was enjoying himself ramble aboout a non-sensical detail that left me frustrated and wanting to put the book down for good, but I carried on and finished the book.The book had its moments but not enough of them to make a clear and understandable story for me. Read at your own risk of being completely disappointed with Faulkner's A Fable."
negative,"UNSAFE: My daughter got this toy for Christmas. She ejoyed it at first, but we soon discovered it is very front heavy. She kept tipping FOrward and hurting herself. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!"
negative,"An Excellent Player: This player is the Best! I wasn't sure how well it would work for the price, since others I have looked at were ""considerably more"". My son was thrilled with it. The quality of the picture is excellent, the sound is perfect, and it doesnt get hot. We have gotten over 3 hours on the battery, and the unit has not froze once. I would highly recommend it. Definitely got my money's worth! And Thank you Amazon.Com, as, you promised and delivered exactly like you said. Just in time for Christmas!"
negative,Straw man theology at it's best: Boettner raises a giant straw man of his own construction then demolishes it as evil before the eyes of the reader. Had he actually presented Catholic doctrine for discussion he could have made the claim to be intelectually honest. As it stands Boettner's book is for people who want to reinforce their own misconceptions of the Church to make themselves feel better.
negative,"Not up to par: I agree with the reviewer who said the A&E 2001 version of this story is much better. While the actors in this version are better known, there was no chemistry at all between Clive Owen and the female lead. Also, the way the ""romance"" was handled created no dramatic tension. In fact, the pacing seemed off for the entire movie. What should have been adventurous and daring ended up flat, boring, and slightly confusing. I don't think it was the brevity of the film itself--I found myself waiting for it to end--but rather that the elements that make up good story telling were markedly absent. I was glad I had gotten this out of the library and neither rented nor bought it."
negative,"works when ur Powerbook G4 is turned off: this charger does not have enough power to charge my Powerbook G4 while it is running. it will show the charger indicator back and forth from battery power to charging.But when I charge while it is off, it works perfect.I had requested a replacement once and the result was still the same."
negative,This Movie Is Bad!: When I saw this movie i thought that it will be good but its bad.I do get the plot of this film but the sound and picture is no good.
negative,"Collapsing stars: Wow, this one just hurts.Amazing band, simply stunning in concert, and now this.I hope they'll rebound. Stranger things have happened. For the moment, though, this stands among the most disappointing releases ever by a band that has had so much to offer in the past.""Sparks are Gonna Fly"" and ""What We Want to Believe In"" are the only songs which led me to give this album even two stars, and even those decent tracks are but an echo of their predecessors.When your B-side compilation is more inspiring than your new release, you know you're in trouble. So it is with Catherine Wheel."
positive,A great story with a moral for today's selfish.: This classic should be read by all. So many of us are like Scrooge wanting everything and not willing to share.
negative,"Should not be called Spaghetti ""Western"" - Misleading: I grew up watching the various Trinity movies and was so excited when I saw This DVD set for sale. Turns out that there are only 2 westerns out of the 10 movies on the DVD. It may not be a big deal if you are a huge Bud Spencer and Terence Hill fan but to market this as a ""Spaghetti Western Bible"" and having the guys in their traditional western garb on the cover, gives you the idea that this is a DVD set of westerns when it's not. I was very disappointed to only see two obscure westerns versus getting a nice collection of Trinity movies."
negative,David Bowie is still hot but this effort is definitely cool!: Still love Bowie but with this CD he seems stuck in the '80s without the flash. Too moody.
negative,"not bad for a cheap knife!: cheap, light weight, quite flexible, doesn't hold a sharp edge very well- but what do you expect from a cheap knife? I bought it because I liked the shape!Use it, abuse it then throw it away or sell at your next ""I'll never do it again"" garage sale."
positive,Christmas Carol: This book was awesome and I highly recommend you to buy itAwesome Book and I think u should buy it
negative,"Basically Boring.: While the information in this book might be a good starting point for someone totally new to thyroid disorders, I found it too basic, and too entrenched in mainstream theory and treatments to be helpful. Too much repeating of information easily found on just about any thyroid drug manufacturer's website, or just from surfing around the web. It is not a book I kept for my personal library --which for me (books are life!) is unusual."
negative,"Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size.: Watch out, Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size. We ended up giving them away, my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly."
negative,":0( BOOO!: first the acting was so so so bad the movie, this is what i have to say ?but they get E for effort."
positive,"Hilarious!: This was totally funny, and it was typical Sedaris. ""Dress Your Family..."" was all about his family, including entire chapters devoted to each of his siblings and his parents. On one hand, he points out all of his family's quirks with humor, but on the other hand, he sweetly sums it up by saying that is why he loves them. If I were his sister, I don't know how I would react to his totally honest observations. However, I am just a grateful reader that loves his humor. This is definately worth the money!"
negative,"JUNK Nelson Turbo-Heart JUNK: I have purchased two of these in the past three years, from two different vendors, They both fell apart in the gear box area, literally fell apart while running. I used them average. Absolute junk and I am ticked off. They aren't cheap priced. They are cheaply assembled.I have never written a bad review for something like this in my life, but now is the time.BTW, Amazon would not allow me to rate it zero stars, so it gets a one star."
positive,"Changes to the story of HOUND but cinematically they are all very good: I think of all the HOUNDS I own, this one is cinematically the best. Of course it is not really fair to compare a film made in 1939 (Rathbone) with one made 40+ years later. So this film must be evaluated on its own merits.Richardson is a terrific Holmes and it is disappointing that he only made one other film from Doyle's ""canon"".To purists of Doyle, be warned that the script introduces a few character not found in the original but they only add to the story-line.And yes, Dr Watson is not played as sharp as say, Hardwicke's characterization (in the Granada series) but overall he is entertaining.The highest marks for this film go for production values, direction, and cinematography. All are superb.Recommended for collectors of Holmes films"
positive,"My favorite game of all time!: I played this game for the first time 8 or 9 years ago and was blown away. This is the ultimate adventure game, in my opinion. The plot is so intricate and the world is so fully realized. I have replayed this game so many times, I've lost count. I'm amazed that this is still available. If you enjoy interactive plots with amazing characters, this is your game."
positive,"Beauty of briefness.: This is one of the better works of existentialist fictions, as Camus illustrates the absurdity and senselessness that we meet in life without shoving overblown philosophical tenets in the reader's face. With deft subtlety and conciseness, Camus manages to say so much in 100 pages, and from a literary standpoint, is much more enjoyable than Sartre's ""Nausea."" I highly recommend this book."
positive,Good Product: This copper bar will be just what I need to fabricate a custom battery disconnect terminal to hide under the rear panel of my 928.
negative,"Right-libertarian views presented as fact: The problem I have with Hazlitt's economics primer is that much of the information he presents as fact is nothing but right-libertarian ideology.Hazlitt attempts to ""explode liberal myths"" by taking out of context the social advances America has made in the last 70 years. The author believes that unchecked corporate power will liberate the economy and, therefore, humanity.Hazlitt is obviously a corporate apologists who refuses to scrutinize the ""successes"" of liberalized trade policies throughout the world. A look at any number of third world countries will reveal the true outcome of relinquishing government and social controls of the economy."
negative,You suck!: Some of these song were good before ET put their no-talent hands all over them. Anyone who is pretending to like this should come to terms with how unbelievabley terrible it is. This band should stick to ruining their own songs.The one star is for actually making the offspring sound better by comparison. Way to go.
positive,Very Good printer: I had a very hard time trying to find a printer that I could afford that printed good quality images. I had an Epson 440 printer that wasn't very good with printing photos and it always put streaks of black ink on everything. I went to Staples to buy a new printer after my Epson died on me and was planning on buying the Canon S600 but they were out of stock so I picked up the HP deskjet 940c and was a bit worried after reading the reviews here that I might not have a good printer but so far this printer is great! The first thing I printed on it was an old photo of my grandfather that came out better than the original. I then printed some wallet size pictures of my son from his school picture they also came out wonderful. I am very pleased with this printer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seems to be a bit slow in printing but as long as the printing comes out well that doesn't bother me too much. I would definitely recommend this printer.
positive,"good vietnam flick: casualties of war showed us the meaning of the title! m.fox did a great job in this one!if you like war storys,this one should be in the top ten list!"
positive,"Dreamcatcher review: I like this novel,the way Stephen King decries the setting and the character. Everything about this novel is good but the alien was joke. Only the alien that all that why i give 4 star out of five."
negative,"third rate at best: i bought this cd because i heard they had some ties to thursday, who are the best band ever. some of the music is good, but the vocals sound forced. it's pretty boring. i'd rather listen to thursday."
negative,"Save Your Money!: After reading what this headphones could do, I was excited and couldn't wait to get one for myself. It turns out to be just another cheezy headphones. The quality is horrible, and it's not comfortable as it claims to be. Bottom line, ""Save your money!"""
negative,"Horrible!: I read this book for my Honors English class and it was terrible! There were so many irrelevant things that were going on that I had to force myself to read 2 chapters a day. The test for Great Expectations was hard because no one could understand the plot. Just imagine a bunch of straight A students getting an average of 75% on the test. This book is outdated, and old English seems as if it is an entire different language. I would give this a negative rating if I could."
negative,"""Digital Copy"" not compatible with iPod or Macs (""Windows Media only""): Classic TV special, but the promise of a ""digital copy"" is misleading. On the back of the cardboard slipcover, in tiny print, is listed this limitation: ""Windows Media-compatible only."" It is implausible that a consumer would come across this disclaimer when making a purchase decision based in part on the overtly advertised inclusion of a ""digital copy,"" a term most consumers associate with the ability to view media on an iPod."
negative,"Brilliant book, enjoyable.: Brilliant , very enjoyable. Man's curiosity and subsequent development... all the family loved this, not only entertaining but educational too."
negative,"Latest stupid kitchen idea: Stains by looking at it. Seriously, as granite is porous, it absorbs stains and they seem to have made this white granite especially susceptible to acquiring stains. Pour out a cup of old coffee into the sink even with the water running and it stains. There is no way to avoid staining it. Its a constant pain, chore and regret."
negative,"Direct fit my a$$: After consulting the Walker website I purchased this direct fit product for my 03 Impala.This muffler is only 15"" long and does not compensate in any way for the factory 16"" muffler.I ended up with a total redneck rig installation. WTFFollow up: I talked to Walker customer service, who were very nice, and was able to get a proper installation. Apparently the product is only ""direct fit"" if it bolts onto another aftermarket Walker product (Requiring me to buy more parts than I anticipated). To me ""direct fit"" means that it should attach to the OEM parts. Other than that the quality was fine."
positive,"creative, original, wonderful: I was in love with this book when I was a young teenager, and it was one of the things that directly inspired me to become an artist. Kudos to Jim Davis for such open minded creativity. I still admire and enjoy every one of these stories and the many flavors of art that go along with them. It has a permanent home on my bookshelf."
negative,"As the kids in school say today ""Boring."": The beginning and ending narrative touched my heart being from the great state of South Dakota and having walked many small cemeteries where veterans flags and tombstones mark the sites of our fallen. Other than that the stories were shallow and uninteresting, lacking depth and insight of the effect of the war on these individuals. Let's face it, post war prosperity brought these veterans the success they enjoy today. I don't think it had much to do with their military experiences. Joe Foss was not revered by South Dakotans to any extent and throwing Al Neuharth in was really clutching at straws.Really it was the parents of these WWII veterans that were the sacrificers, the moralists, the conservers, the workers, the survivors that should get the credit."
negative,"garbage: I got 2 of these at a dollar store, different color, same light. The light is dim when new, uses to tiny cells that you can't replace. When the batteries die, that's it. First the batteries aren't the recharable type. Shaking the light makes it work only when it's on. However, for the price I got 2 fantastically strong magnets, so it was good for something. in the end."
negative,"Disappointing: The first Spiderman was entertaining. It did what it was supposed to do, which was give every comic book loving man and woman a decent action flick. The new Spiderman however has lost something. The directing is shoddy at best. The script is awful. There are just too many awful lines. ""... you're just an empty seat..."" ""I've always been standing in your doorway."" Spiderman is supposed to have a serious side, but the script was total garbage. The actors did a good job with what was given to them, but the story just could not hold up the foundations. Overall a disappointing movie."
negative,"A Horrid book: This book started off slow and never picked up. There is nothing interesting or different about Uncle Trapspringer, it is a complete waste of time and money. I found the Kender to be so completely depressing. It is the ownly Dragonlance book so far that I have completely dispised."
negative,"Waste of money: I agree with the others who have said this does little or nothing to keep a drink warm. Lukewarm is at best, and you still have to continue to reheat a beverage if you want it to be anything close to warm or hot."
negative,"poor show: This dvd was worse than the ancient Channel 5 (Metromedia) broadcasts of movies on tv in the 1950s and 1960s in New York City.Vertical lines proliferate in the copy, portions of scenes are faded or too dark, etc.I made a mistake in buying this.This was bought at amazon.com"
negative,"failed after minimum use: Item failed after about 3 months. contacted mfr, who said would repair or replace if i sent to them and paid for repairs. so much for warranty!bought a similar item retail (for less than paid for Timex) and now happy but smarter about buying online."
negative,cd up for trash: tried to listen to it again to give it a chance. still it sounded as disgusting as the first try.my only advice to Clay now is to make sure he completes his college degree soonest cos he may be back sooner teaching than he expects.i also wish him all the luck in his future endeavors.i know he has already lost several fans who can tell good music from bad.
negative,"Poor support from Plasplugs: About four weeks ago, I purchased at a Home Depot in Florida the Plasplugs ""Master Tiler"", model number: DWW180US-BX.I am using it for a porcelain tile installation. The original blade worked ok for the initial cuts, but I need to replace it for the proper blade type for the tile. I had bought a porcelain tile replacement blade from a blade mfr when I bought the saw. When I got around to replacing the blade, I found out that the Plasplugs machine uses a different ""arbor"" than everybody else. The replacement blade was worthless to me.I then called the Plasplugs US office to order the ""high glaze"" blade. Much to my chagrin, I was told the ""all blades except the standard have been discontinued"".I just bought this saw four weeks ago! I think it is very irresponsible for a manufacturer to behave in this matter.You can be assured that I will avoid any Plasplug product in the future."
positive,The Thunder Rolls: This book allows us to see God's word applied to situations we have been in and can relate to. Further proving the awesome power He has!
negative,They lost me at Bollywood: I was enjoying this series until the HORRIBLE Bollywood episode when the solution to the issue of a huge Abnormal who could move sections of the earth was a Bollywood-style dance. That ended it for me.
positive,"Different and Good!: For quite a while now I've been using two products called ""Green Vibrance"" and another called "" Miracle Reds"", both of which are superb products. I decided to give this a try. Its very good and if you look at the product information, what it really is, is a combination of the other two I mentioned. Both greens and reds. So if you are running late, this one product will do it all. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
positive,"Cheap, fun toy: This is a fun toy and better than I expected. It is not very durable and sometimes the teeth stick down, but overall it is enjoyable. My older daughter loves to play with me, but it is even easy enough for my 1yr old to play too. It's also small enough for the younger one to hold. Their surprise when the mouth snaps shut is adorable."
negative,"suckfest: if you gave this movie more than 1 star you are high. no plot , bad acting, and too gruesome for theaters...NOT!!.the movie goes on for an hour before anything happens and then its' just downhill from there.not gorry just boring..."
positive,those in our world with special needs: this is a extraordinary book for young children. it will teach them to understand and respect others (humans as well as animals) who have special needs. i highly recommend it!
positive,You've seen the movie: You've already seen the movie and know it's a classic. My kids enjoyed it just as much as I did. A great movie to have in your collection.
positive,"perfect campground tent: You certainly wouldn't want to take this backpacking, but for use at a campground, this tent would be hard to beat. I purchased it from a gold box offer shortly before Memorial Day, and just got back from a camping trip. Everyone was jealous of this HUGE tent. I am 6'5'' and could stand up comfortably in the center of this tent.It rained 2 of the 3 nights we were out there, and one night it POURED. Despite the usual loudness of the rain on the fly, this was a pleasant experience. No rain got into the tent, and thanks to the ceiling vents and well designed fly, we stayed cool and happy the entire night.Easy to set up, easy to take down. Easy to shake off after a rainfall to pack up immediately.1 adult and 4 kids was no problem, everyone had PLENTY of personal space. I imagine 4 adults fit in quite comfortably.Eureka hasn't let me down, and if you are in the market for a HUGE tent, this is the one to get."
positive,"Straight-on Acoustic Blues: A friend recommended this lady to me, ""you might like this"". You bet! She hooked me on the opening few bars of the first cut, and really didn't let up. This is traditional acoustic blues, with a very intense vocal effort, a soprano with a very good range. Blues soprano? White girl sings the delta? You bet! She captures traditional blues perfectly, hits it right on."
negative,"Already forgotten: This book was selected by NY Times as a notable book of the year. The NY Times, indeed, knew what's up. More than any other, Born to Rebel belonged to the year in which it was published; it didn't take long at all for it to be forgotten--as soon as the next year arrived it became a historical document. A classic? Stunning? Masterful? Why is its reputation in rapid decline? Sulloway writes books which don't even pass the 2-year test. Surely this is a perfect example of how vulnerable ""contemporary"" reputation is."
positive,"A Powerful Message: The Hagakure is a mixed bag for the average reader- some of the contents are life changing and pensive, while others seem very out of place. Overall, it provides an excellent view into the way of life that was the Samurai. It had a profound impact in my daily life, and I would like to absorb more after another time through it."
positive,"A Must Read for Everyone!: This is my fourth time reading this little book. It is from a radio broadcast in London durring the blitz of WW2. I would have called it ""Humanity: 101"""
negative,How is this supposed to work?: I got these for my jawbone headset. Many had said they work great. but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone.
negative,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD: This DVD is terrible quality. DO NOT BUY IT. The volume on the tracks are very low and it occasionally skips as though this was copied from a poor quality VHS. Buy the re-released Warner Brothers edition from itunes its only 10 bucks.
positive,"Lots of form, and lots of fun....: Not quite sure what was going on here....kinda reminded me of a cross between Groundhog Day and the multiple-endings in ""Clue"", but fun nonetheless. Very energetic film that FLIES by!This DVD edition features and English soundtrack, as well as the German soundtrack, and the english subtitles can be turned on if you are a purist watching the German-language version. Also, the disc is two-sided, one side being full-screen, the other being letterbox."
positive,"Relevant Today: This is a fast, easy read. Leftest view, nevertheless, a very well researched and coherently presented overview on the forces acting on the availability, supply and ultimately the price of oil (and petroleum products). It certainly helped me understand the persistent spikes in gasoline prices we seem to be experiencing with greater frequency. It presents a convincing argument that dwindling supplies of oil in the face of insatiable US demand augmented by increased usage from China and India are likely to pressure supply sources for the forseeable future."
negative,"Tour of Duty, offensive and Insensitive: As a Viet Nam war veteran, I am completely offended by Tour of Duty, which is nothing more than an attempt to exploit a bloody conflict (in which over 35,000 Americans died) to promote the Kerry candidacy for the presidency. This is not only inappropriate but is egregiously insensitve to both the survivors of that war and the families of its victims! It is exactly the kind of opportunism one has come to associate with that portion of the political spectrum. John Kerry should apologize and immediately arrange for the removal of Tour of Duty from the shelves!!!"
positive,"Accomplished poet: Ms. Park's poems and stories reveal her penetrating insight into the Asian-American experience, and into New York City's ever-changing melting pot. Her work is alive with empathy and honesty. In ""Anatomy of a Fish Store"" she shows a multi-dimensional understanding of the spectrum from her own background to her surroundings, and the interplay of many different ethnicities.As a teacher, I find her work very promising for use with high school or college-level students. Her authenticity, hipness and street-smarts are a natural for hard-to-reach teens to connect with. Her humanity and intelligence should make her work appealing to readers of all backgrounds."
positive,"Agreeing with RB: I agree with RB from Delaware. Most of the songs are pretty good on this album, although Clay's voice is not the same as it was on television. I sure hope they aren't trying to change his style of singing. I'd recommend it to anyone who's ready for a change and a great singer - simply because Clay is the best."
negative,"NOT a Tango movie to buy!: As far as tango is concerned, this is NOT a movie to buy based on the word Tango in the title. As for the movie itself, we'll let's just say that it is not worth purchasing let alone the time wasted by watching this film. I am a fan of Argentine Tango, and this movie does not have any worthy tango scenes."
negative,"Didn't warm at all!!: It seems like all of the reviews on here had problems with this warmer from one extreme to the other! My problem was that the warmer didn't warm the bottles at all. At one point, I left it plugged in for more than 30 minutes and it did almost nothing, which of course is unacceptable when you've got a hungry infant! Wouldn't bother with this one again and I recommend that anyone thinking of buying it doesn't waste their money!"
negative,"A short story told in 400 pages.: This book could have made a wonderful short story, but as a full length novel it lacks both and entertaining plot and characters that one can truly empathize with."
negative,slimcook: This had no impact whatsoever on my warts. I was concerned that one of my children would think it was lip balm and accidentally use it on their lips...this didn't happen but I even if it had it certainly wouldn't have hurt as it seemed like wax.
negative,"BUYER BEWARE!!!: Please heed my warning. This movie sucks! I just want to be honest. My girlfriend and I just wasted 20 minutes of our lives and $15 fastforwarding through the most grossly mismarketed movie ever. With due respect or whatever, no one buying a movie to get more Dylan cares about Mickey Jones namedropping about people who no one cares about. This is NOT a Dylan movie. This is shameless marketing b.s. Lame."
positive,great quality: For the money this is the best quality sound and options. You can have 5-10 people all in the same office using at the same time with no feedback or echoing.
positive,"Extraordinary Popular delusions and the Madness of Crowds: This book discusses a number of bubbles. Mostly in the 17th and 18th centuries. it is applicable to more current bubbles such as the Clinton DOT COM . The Housing bubble created by Messrs Franks and dodd.Other financial messes such as the power crisis caused by the state of California stepping in and forcing rules on the power pricing/Enron failure.More importantly, it is applicable to today and the printing presses running wild at the behest of our government in Washington. pushing for more and more social programs which won't be financially sustainable.All good ideas have within them tragic flaws. If it sounds too good to be true - it is.A great read and it's available in hard and soft backed editions.thanks,"

positive,"Great flick, slow DVD start: The BD version takes the SD version to a whole new level! The colors are brighter, the clarity even better and the audio is fantastic - just as you would expect with a great movie in a full HD format. The only flaw is that this disk starts up rrrreeeeaaallllyyyy slow - so slow that I was all ready to send it back to Amazon for a replacement when I tossed it into our player (Samsung BD-P1400, firmware dated 09/08) one last time and then got distracted by a phone call; when I returned, the movie was up and running like normal. Our family estimates that it takes about 3 minutes to bring up the main menu... Outside of this flaw, everything else is great."
positive,"TRUE WORSHIP: Nomatter what I am going through, Darien and LW's music is always able to bring my back into focus. If you are looking for a true worship album, this is the ONE!! There are lots of ""worshippers"" and commercialized gospel singers out there doing the best they can, but you can tell when the focus goes away from the Lord. Darien's writing stays true to the reason we sing, and that is the Almighty King. You will fall down on your knees. You will dance and shout in praise! BUY THIS ALBUM - IT WILL BE THE BEST SPIRITUAL INVESTMENT YOU EVER MAKE (AFTER ACCEPTING CHRIST)!"
positive,Good: This product arrived on time and in excellent condition. These boots have a good arch and seem sturdy. They do look a little cheaper than I anticipated. The tread is great. Size runs true.
positive,Great series!: I love the Smallville series and getting it on DVD is the best. Tom Welling is great as Superman and I really like how this series gives a back story to Superman for those of us who didn't read the comic books.
negative,"Nothing stands out...: Rolling Stones by the numbers. It's ok and it does rock for a bunch of guys now in their 60's. However, nothing stands out. Where is the ""Start Me Up"", ""Brown Sugar""?I listened to it over and over and it sounds as if they decided it's time to tour, we had better put out a CD. That said, why bother? We will all show up at the concert anyway. I just hope they don't play too many songs from this CD.They can and have done much better in the past. Go to the concerts and avoid this CD."
positive,An amazing voice...: I knew we had a winner the first time I heard his voice in the auditions. This CD is amazing and I listen to it constantly. I just hope he has another listen to all year CD coming out soon.
positive,"It's a Guy Thing: Face it - Guys like tooth picks better than floss - if we will use floss at all. If you are not into flossing try these picks. They work very well at getting between teeth and removing food that floss will miss. The tooth pick tip is tapered and ridged to get between teeth and clean out the tartar as well as food particles. The 'feathered' end is great at removing the smaller particles (similar to floss). These will improve your dental health when used regularly, and they are way easier to use than floss."
negative,JUNK JUNK JUNK: This charger is horrible. Worked for long enough for me not to be able to get my money back from Amazon. Makes the screen blink while charging and flashes back and forth from charging to not charging. Customer service at this company is horrible. After waiting two weeks for a response they wanted me to send it back before I get a new one. Who knows how long that will take. I am probably going to have to trash this waste of money for the more expensive Apple one. I guess you get what you pay for.
negative,"It's sad when ""Invisible"" is the best song...: Wow, this is one of the worst CDs I've listened to all year long. Clay has talent, but I don't understand how someone could care so little about the music they're putting out. Cliched, soulless, derivative schlock. Doesn't he have even a little artistic integrity? Everyone involved with this album should be embarrassed.Oh well, I'm sure his fans will eat up anything he produces."

negative,Worst quality coffee maker ever!: Clock started losing time the first day. Great tasting coffee. No problem with the carafe. Unit stopped working all together after about 10 days. Returned it to DeLonghi & they promptly sent me another. Clock started losing time the first day. Great tasting coffee. No problem with the carafe.

positive,"Cold war based British espionage drama: Micheal Caine plays Frank Jones a decorated ex-British Navy veteran and now businessman. His beloved son Bob played by Nigel Havers is a Russian linguist working for the British Secret Service before the days of detente. He tells Caine that he suspects some strange things are happening in his agency, that he would like to expose.The Secret Service suspicious of Havers has been bugging his conversations and ultimately liquidate him, covering up his death. Caine, unsatisfied with the official declaration of an accidental death, commences his own investigation.He eventually is lead to John Gielgud playing high ranking politician Sir Adrian Chapple who acting as a Russian mole, has been feeding them sensitive bits of intelligence for years.With a distinctly British flavor, ""The Whistle Blower"" is an above average vintage Cold War drama that uses at it's conclusion the incredible pagaentry of a monarchy sponsored parade filmed in the streets of London."
positive,Sanuk sandals: Great sandal. Very light and comfortable. I read they don't hold up well but these have done nice for me so far. Glad I purchased them.
negative,"Very noisy: I loved the old Jenga game and Uno and thought...wow...a game that has both! After receiving it, the tiles were made out of cheap plastic and when the tower collapsed, it was extremely loud. I ended up donating it to Good Will."
positive,"A member of the Elite.: Pure perfection! It simply is, one of the greatest finger-style, guitar albums ever.You cant go wrong, and it cant be matched in chops, writing and passion.Bensusan, is considered one of the greatest guitarists in the world so you will get an earfull of great acoustic guitar picking....he also vocalizes over some tunes occassionally (80% instrumental 20% w/vocals), typically folksy lament in French or pure abstract scatisms....now imagine a Frenchman scatting over solo guitar with a celtic flavor, at the highest degree of beauty and technique.......Considered a leader in Celtic interpretations as well, playing exclusively in the DADGAD tuning......you have Bensusan."
negative,"Seems like counterfeit product..: I've been buying Dickies,particularly the 874's for over 20 years and I wasn't impressed with these ones at all..While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product,it didn't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin, and the pants had no factory crease..Live and learn.."
positive,"A practical life-saving guide.: The book gives practical advice for those with diabetes. I've had type 2 diabetes for 13 years and when another ailment required me to use prednisone, I needed insulin. Dr. Bernstein's book taught me about the types of insulin and syringes. His book removed my apprehension about needles and possible low blood glucose. Like many pioneers in medicine, Dr. Bernstein's ideas were opposite to mainstream methods when his book was first introduced. However, his recommendation for a limited carbohydrate diet like that of the late Dr. Atkins, appears to be gaining acceptance. Control of diabetes is very much up to the patient. Dr. Bernstein's book puts life-saving knowledge in the hands of the patient. I have found it invaluable."
positive,"economic value: great product and great leakage protection but these diapers seem almost too small and my daughter, she is 24 lbs. the pampers cruisers fit alot better."
negative,"I' m not a genius: this book made me feel like the dumbest teenager on earth. It taught strategies that I would never use and don't really get . The vocabulary words were very good but Kaplan's list is better. In addition, Kaplan also includes some nmemonics in order to help the student remember the word. I hate how the book never really explained the answer but just told what the correct answer was because it ""made the most sense."" ""Is a vagrant a person without a domicile. Yup!"" This was one of the explanations that the book gave. It got me running to the dictionary and feeling like a dumba**. If I knew what the words meant, I wouldn't have gotten the book in the first place."
negative,"Leaked more than regular diapers: Since my daughter started sleeping on her belly she would wake up every night in the middle of the night with her clothes all wet. So I tried this diaper and now instead of getting all wet once a night, it's been happening twice a night. It's worse than regular diapers and the bottom coverage is not wide enough for a baby's bottom (my baby is not big, she's in the 50th percentile)."
positive,"The Original Pearl Harbor: I watched this again after seeing the new Pearl Harbor and was amazed how much the new version copied TTT, right down to camera angles. For it's day the special effects were some of the best.I liked PH especialy for the effects - there were only a couple of real planes and the rest digitized, the downside was having to put up with the sappy love story."
positive,"great for deisel trucks: I have a 2006 ford f350 super duty with the 6.0 ltr which is known for starting hard in the winter . the thought of leaving the 1000 watt heater plugged in all the time made me nuts, this timer works great and very easy to set up .with the higher wattage my heater drawls it works great. two thumbs up for the price!"
negative,"duh!: started out very good. as the plot thickened, the details disappeared, making full comprehension difficult. ending incomplete.started out very"
positive,"Phenomenal!: Anyone interested in Paganism, Witchcraft, or Wicca really should own this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is fluff-free and academically, though not poorly, written."
negative,"If you gave me this, I'd drop it in the trash.: As a mechanic, I love speciality tools. But I bought and returned this after one use. Maybe it works with perfect bolts/nuts, but I had a rusted and rounded off 9/16"" exhaust nut, and it wouldn't EVEN GRIP THE NUT. The tool is called GRIP-TITE, Grip WHAT!? Do not buy this if you expect a professional tool. This is for someone who works on nothing bigger than a tricyle."
negative,Very Frustrating Piece of Office Equipment: I have had the displeasure of working with this machine for over 4 years. Its incompetent feeder is only matched by the uselessness of the software it comes with. Save yourself the frustration and buy another scanner.
negative,"Contains SunnComm MediaMax Spyware: Strongly recommend not buying. A couple of reviewers below stated that this CD does not contain the XCP rootkit. While they are technically correct this CD DOES CONTAIN the Sony/SunnComm MediaMax software that has been proven to be a big security risk also. The software installs even if one rejects the EULA; the software goes on to install regardless. For details see Professor Alex Halderman's website at Princeton University, ""Not Again! Uninstaller for Other Sony DRM Also Opens Huge Security Hole"" at ""www.freedom-to-tinker.com""."
positive,"Moses: This is a very good movies, I'am glad i purchased it. the best acting i have seen in a long time. mnbrown49"
negative,"What a disappointment: I was so excited when i ordered this manual (so to speak). Instead of it helping me, it confused me more than anything.. It is like the author is trying to convince herself she actually was a real mistress and had multiple conversations and lectures with wives. I feel as though she was a lonely old person that had a one night stand with a married man and tried to understand the mindset of a wife..I want to throw this paper with typed lies in the trash were it belongs.. I believe Rupaul was born a woman anyday over this author.. What a hot mess. A waste of ink. P. S. I love RU."
positive,"For Lovers of Latin American Literature: I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Oprah's list. I read this book in college and it was my first exposure to magic realism. Such imaginative narrative is hard to come by and who could forget such events as the discovery of a dead angel, the whole town suffering from insomnia, or the beautiful Remedios (one of many)ascending to heaven? Just as a sidenote I find one of the characters toward the end is disturbingly like Michael Jackson with his lifestyle of decadence and his penchant for the company of little boys. It's a book that is very sensual and colorful, I would love to see it transferred successfully to film. But this book is not for anyone. Just for those who love truly imaginative literature."
negative,"Lush but flawed: There is no argument that the soundtrack that this album is from is a well crafted and artistic film but unfortunately the songs have been so overproduced since the original 1976 much rawer concept album that it loses much of the ""edge"" and message.I hope it wasn't star ego that led to Madonna (playing Evita) singing ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"". The switch in cast (it was originally sung by the mistress Evita was throwing out - who disappears from view in this album) completely loses the pathos and point of the song and does a great dis-service to the whole piece.Buy the 1976 concept album first with Paul Jones (possibly the most under-rated Peron) and Julie Covington (singing a really hard-nosed ladder-climbing Evita) to hear how this should sound on audio."
positive,"Love, love this Book: We first checked this book out at the library. My child, 2 at the time, giggle and laughed, especially when the dog licks the boy's hand. We had to buy our own copy. I later used this book with a neighbor boy who was terrified of dogs. It showed him that the little boy in the book gave the dog a chance and so should he. It helped a bit. The writing in the book is easy to follow, on a child's level and the pictures are darling. Highly recommend this book!"
positive,Good service: I was pleased with the condition of the book and the speed with which I received it. Thanks.
positive,"A Joy to Read: Not since I read (on April 11, 1986) Russell Baker's Pulitzer-prize-winning Growing Up has there been a book of this genre which has so moved me. I spent a rural boyhood myself, but I cannot say it was as rich and varied and interesting as Jimmy Carter's, and it was not spent in Georgia. This is a very pleasant book to read, and you will never regret spending a little time reading this well-written book, full of insight and nostalgia. I hope it wins this year's (or next year's)Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, as Russell Baker's delightful book did in 1983."
positive,"How to lie with statistics: I have just finish reading this book and, in my opinion, I thought that it is a very simple and funny whey to learn statistic.However, for people who intend to purchase something with more details about tests and analyses, I don't recommend this book."
negative,"RETURNED IT!: We purchased this bed for an extra for when the kids come over. Nice looking, but don't let looks deceive you. By the morning, you won't have any air in your bed."
negative,Sloppy Presentation: I have all 4 Harry Potter DVDs and I have no complaints whatsoever as far as the movies is concerned. What really bothers me is the presentation... why are the first two DVDs packaged one way and the second two packaged in a different way? ... and this last one didn't even have a menu insert! Very inconsistent presentation throughout the series... what will #5 be...? A Digipack? Shame on Warner Brothers!
positive,"GREAT HISTORY: THIS BOOK TELLS THE GRUESOME STORY OF THE DEATH (OR NOT) OF KING EDWARD 2ND. IT MAKES A GREAT STORY & DOHERTY TELLS IT IN A WAY THAT KEPT ME TURNIING THE PAGES...I'VE READ IT TWICE & NOW WANT TO READ DOHERTY'S ""ISABELLA AND THE STRANGE DEATH OF EDWARD 2"" SAME STORY WORTH REPEATING."
negative,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre: I hate that movie you people are totaly sick of thinking you should make and old moive and a new graphic movie. About those kids who died, you shouldnt even think like that to make a repeat of what happened to them, just think if it was about you would you want other people to watch it? How about your kids? why the HELL!!!! would you want them to see a movie like that. people are sick now a days just think when your were littel they didn't have half the bad movies they do now i think they should get rid of that movie and start making funny, happy, movies and get rid of the violence. Why do you think that their is so much violence now,oh well i dont know because you make those GOD DAMN! movies. STOP making them and it will be a much better world and kids will not be influenced about it you sick fools."
negative,"NOT APPROPRIATE FOR TODDLERS: I read this to my 2 1/2 year old and she's had nightmares for a week about hunters shooting her with guns. In the book,hunters come after Horton and point their guns at him. Horton braces to be shot but then the hunters change their mind and kidnap him to the circus instead. In general it's a dark tail for the littler ones. Go ahead and read it to your kid if you want them to wake up crying and screaming like mine did."
positive,"One of My Favorites: Ed Abbey was easily one of the best authors to write about the American Southwest. His humor and wit contrast nicely with his love of the desert. DESERT SOLITAIRE allows the reader to drift into a much simpler, slower life for a short time. Mr.Abbey's polemic about the National Parks is quite entertaining, as I am sure it will just be a matter of time before we have rubber rocks in Yosemite!"
negative,"this book was a big dissapointment: I found this book to be very out of date. I can't count how many times I read ""coming in 2000"" and then no info on the subject. I didn't expect this from a book written for 2001. I have the 2000 official guide and it is much more up to date. The only thing I liked about the book is the coverage of non disney parks. This book was a huge waste of money."
positive,"Just right!: ...meaning not too hot not too cold- mfg. knows what they're doing in the design... not the self-appointed ""critic geniuses"" spouting off left and right here.. Yes, put a coaster or lid atop your mug to retain even more heat if you need it warmer (will also lessen evaporation)...just common sense...lol! The diameter of the heated surface is apporoximately 3 and 7/16ths of an inch so it will accomodate a mug that's medium large in size(a little bigger than average)."
negative,"New Age?: The song is sung beautifully, but is it promoting New Age? Should we believe in ourselves or in God? I think the focus should be more on believing in God and not just in ourselves."
positive,"good read: The lead character in the book is an interesting person who sees halos -- not really angelic ones but the halos in the reflected light and yet in that halo she sees hope and goodness. In some ways, this character seems rather Pollyanna-ish, but she is what we perhaps wish we could be -- seeing the good and the positive and hoping for the best.The town she finds herself in has a deep dark secret that they protect, even at her expense and in the end the people of the town have to face the reality of it.The book keeps your attention and the ending was inevitable."
negative,It doesen't worth it...: This is a book where the author tells about his own expirience on self therapy in order to accept the fact that he isn't as good as he would like to be in his professional area (despite he thinks he is teaching how to run a good life - i.e. finding hapiness despite you don't have the recognition that you would like in your professional area). Perhaps it can be helpful for someone who doesen't have a grate consciousness about him/herself and/or face the same problem of the author.
negative,"Lasted only 1.5 years!: It is out of warranty so Keurig (Green Mountain Coffee Roasters)is replacing this for $80.00; however, I must return the K-Cup holder and MY expense to prove that I am not fraudulent!"
negative,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. A total rip off.: This 52 minute video is nothing more than 8-10 minutes of bad content on a loop. It is a video of one woman doing sing-along style songs. Any claims that this is a ""Sign Language"" video are dubious at best. There are very few real American Sign Language signs, so few as to be pointless. An episode of Blues Clues has more signs. I feel ripped off, and I didn't even pay any money of out my own pocket (I was using $15 in free Amazon Unbox credit from a promotion). Stay away from this video at all costs. I highly recommend Signing Time, which isn't yet available from Amazon Unbox. I hope it will be soon; I'm going to send the makers of Signing Time an email asking them to get their content online."
negative,"Garbage: Really dumb Keanu Reeves film that has him fighting the underworld and dying of lung cancer at the same time. Keanu Reeves is Keanu Reeves, don't expect much emotion from him or for that matter much acting ability either. Rachel Weisz on the other hand does deliver the goods with her very good performance but she's literally alone in the good acting department while she is surrounded by actors who are more in tuned with Keanu's style of acting. This movie rip off a movie called ""The Prophecy"" and it does it so blatantly that it even steals its climax.I suggest you rent that movie instead."
negative,"Keep away from Children's reach...: Half of ""Silent Night, Deadly Night P2"" is footage taken from the previous entry. (Ricky) Psychotic Killer's younger brother goes on a killing spree (just like his dead brother) again in a Santa Claus suit...Nothing new, the acting is awful & often hilarious.The film is violent and often revolting. This time Mother Superior gets her head chopped...Not for the casual viewers."
positive,Great Reference for students or beginers: If you are a begginer in supply chain this book is right for you.
positive,happy 90's swing good beat: this is good . as a leader in the return to swing band sound the zoot suiter's are a excellent group . Their sound is big band with the funky undertones that the people like so well today. I recomend this album wholeheartily
positive,"I can't believe it...: Wow...finally the United States is playing music that has been around for a very long time and is very popular in Europe and most of the World. Industrial electronic EBM music has been around for quite some time from the likes Covenant, :Wumpscut:, VNV Nation just to name a few. It's a shame that Madonna's fans know more about EBM than American fans that have TRL stuffed downed their throat everyday. The music industry in America stinks and should realize that there is better music out there that dosn't revolve around the Inquirer's front page and who is dating who. Who cares music is supposed to be music and these girls are at least out there now and hopefully more bands and singles will creep from the wood works to shake American ""music"" as we know it."
positive,"Relaxing, refreshing and rejuvenating: I love this CD! I purchased it on a whim, I was looking for something to help me sleep. It does help with sleep and so much more. It also works great for relaxing and meditating. The music is soothing and unobstrusive. You will find yourself able to fall asleep quicker and have a deeper more regenerative sleep. This is exactly what I needed.I highly recommend it for anyone needing help falling asleep and staying asleep. If I wake up during the night, I just turn this CD on and within a few minutes I am back to sleep.Check out the other CD's in his collection, they are all wonderful!"
negative,"Animal Farm the cartoon: The book animal farm was written over 60 years ago and has recently been placed in the top 100 books ever, has been turned into a cartoon for the children's film of the same name. The book was famous for mocking the Russian revolution. This is no longer visible in the film And in the eyes of a child they would have no idea what it is linked with. The film does follow the book for most of it, but the director has certain parts. He has tried to improve the plot, but after reading the book, it somewhat makes the plot worse.This is a reasonable conversion, children and people who haven't read the book will find it an average cartoon but for people that have read it will find it disappointing because the main characters are missing, main parts are missing, and some parts are randomly changed."
negative,"Desert Solitaire: I was disappointed with this book. I expected informative and interesting descriptions of the desert southwest, and there is some of this. However, the author gets so carried away with inappropriate political discussion and criticism of almost everyone and everything, it really detracts from the story. I actual skipped through some of these parts. When he does stay with the natural descriptions, the author is knowledgable and actually quite poetic. Some of his descriptions are over-the-top though with tedious classical and cultural references. Would not recommend this book. I'm sure there are much better books with stories and information on the desert that avoid the political extremism."
negative,"the music is okay, but the gimic bothers me.: T.A.T.U., I don't quite know what to do with you. I actually enjoy the music, not despite or because of the ""gimick"" ..., but I enjoyed the sound of the group before I comprehended the words or saw the video. Now I myself quite enjoy the idea of girls in love,... But when it comes to this subject, I like to see the subject of teenage [relationships] handled more delicatly. Because otherwise it's just feeding into the latest fad. ..."
positive,"Stupendous: Mandy Moore has always been considered second best to the likes of reigning pop superstar Britney Spears and archrival Christina Aguilera, even Jessica Simpson these days (because of her infamous Newlyweds moments that brought her to the public's attention for an additional 15 minutes). But in late 2003, four years after her semi-sweet So Real release in 1999, Moore hit us with an incredible album of covers appropriately entitled Coverage. Not only did its first smash ""Have a Little Faith in Me"" become a surprising chart hit, it showcased that Miss Moore had not only grown up as a person, but as a vocalist too. Her amazing vocals are put forefront on Coverage, from ""The Whole of the Moon"" to ""Drop the Pilot."" Though it did not receive as much commercial success as Britney's 2003 super-smash In the Zone, Moore's Coverage did receive critical acclaim, something not many pop teensters can achieve these days. Congrats Mandy: you did great on growing up and this album."
positive,"Perfect size for what I was looking for: Very nice 6 qt size. I replaced two pots that were also 6 qt, but shallower and too large of diameter to easily fix both on the stove top at one time. This one is great."
positive,"A Tale of Courage: This novel tells of Damocles de Warrenne, and his life before, during, and after serving in the (2nd) Regiment of Heavy Calvalry, known as the Queen's Greys.I really enjoyed the way Wren examined so many different characters and their complexities.This novel has adventure, suspense, romance, and humor. Through it all, Wren tells the story of a Damocles and his quest to live up to his family's reputation in the armed forces. It's a good read and a fun adventure that has an amazing ending!"
negative,"Answers are unreadable: I was very disappointed in this toy. I had something like this as a child, but I found that the answers were unreadable on this product. The answers were off center so the numbers appeared behind the equation. Also, they were difficult to read because the plastic was almost TOO opaque. Really, I wish I could get my money back for this, but the return process is a pain when I'm so busy already.I gave this product two stars because although the execution was terrible, the over all durability of the product was good."
positive,"Cool early effort of Mel Gibson: Mad Max is a very good movie.It's loaded with action,and it's got a good(but kind of strange)musical score that really adds to the feel of the movie.The plot is pretty good.It takes place sometime in the future(at least from when the movie was made)in Australia.The highways of Australia have become very unsafe,with biker gangs running wild.Most of the film is about a very nasty gang,led by a crazy guy called the Toecutter,that is out for revenge on a cop named Max,who they blame for the death of their friend the Nightrider.(he died in a fiery crash toward the beginning of the film,after an excellent chase)After the gang kills Max's wife and baby,he becomes the hunter,and the gang the hunted,and Max gets revenge in the end.This is a very good film,done on a very small budget.The only version I've ever seen is the American,I would love to see the Australian Sometime.This movie is followed by an excellent(and bigger budget)sequal,The Road Warrior."
negative,"didn't last long: This dsl modem installed very easily. It was completely plug and play after the software installation. It worked perfectly for 2 or 3 days then stopped working. The lights on the panel indicated all was normal but I was unable to access the internet. I turned it off, turned it on, unplugged it, plugged it back in, held my breath until my face turned purple but nothing helped. I plugged my old, intermittent, unreliable dsl modem back in and regained internet access. The defective Zoom unit was returned to amazon for a refund."
positive,Hidden Messages in Water calendar review: This calendar really is pretty. It is definately not like any calendar I have seen before! The information in this calendar is also very interesting. I ordered this because it seemed original & it really is. I like it very much!!
positive,if interested in knowledge of the buddist religion; this is a must book: from start to finish it left you with knowledge and a possible desire to get in deeper. i read the entire book in only two sessions.
positive,Tom savini did a great gob I love it: George a Romero my favorite director of all time made the og version and he trusted savini to direct the remake it and it was awesome.savini did a great job with this film he put his own twist on it I loved it if you have not seen it see it buy it now you will not be disappointed if you liked the og you will want to watch this one great zombie movie savini is awesome
negative,Never works: I've had this machine for 10 months. It only worked for 2 weeks. It just sits there making noise while brewing and nothing comes out.
negative,"IS NOT CAPABLE WITH WINDOWS XP.: You probably read towards the bottom of the description that it works with XP, and you'll even read it on the BACK OF THE PACKAGE, but it's not true. compaq still has no drivers for XP to recognize the PA-2, so if you have XP you'd better get a different mp3 player."
negative,"A waste of time: Please don't waste your money or time on this book. Sure, it might make some people feel good, but it does it at the expense of their brains. In the intro he mentions 325 ad. He is referring to the Council of Nicea - which omitted certain gnostic writings from the Bible - oh, like the one in which Jesus had to remove Mary's imperfection- so he changed her into a man. The author evidently has a problem with the Council's actions. I would say more, but it all would be about the same. If you just have to spend your money on something, choose a good charity."
negative,"An Unclear Biography of Napoleon: Napoleon is probably one of the most widely written about historical figures. There are many differing views about his intentions and ambitions. Markham takes a somewhat 'unclear' point of view when writting about the French Emperor. At times it seems like he is praising Napoleon for one thing or the other and at other times he is criticizing the ' Corsican Orge'. He laudes Napoleon's form of government as being advanced beyond its years yet he draws on unreliable memoirs which denounced Napoleon with impunity. 'Unreliable' memoirs are those which were written by those, between 1815 and 1830, who wished to regain Bourbon favour and be allowed back into prestigious positions. I feel that Markham doesn't give a very lucid explaination for the intervention in Spain or for that matter in Russia. Towards the end the picture drawn in this book becomes more nebulous, and we are given the choice between two uncompromising pictures of Napoleon."
positive,Great choice for a lover of spoofs: Airplane 2 is a great movie that doesnt butcher the idea of airplane. It has more jokes and even some better spoofs. Highly recommended for lovers of spoofs.
negative,.....eh....: it was well written and i probably would have enjoyed the plot had i been able to follow it. i lost interest before the end and lost the book...no sweat off my back. it was nothing special and it would probably be better going to the library.
negative,"Stay away from this car seat: We got this car seat as a gift. From the beginning we had problems with it. The seat didn't seem to fit into the base very well, and it was always a struggle to connect and disconnect the seat from the base. The second time we used the seat, we noticed the foam pads inside the head support had disintegrated into dust, and had gotten all over our baby's head and clothes. There is a reason why this car seat it so cheap, and its because its a poor quality product. Luckily, we purchased a Graco car seat and have had no problems with it."
positive,"One of the few good ones: I don't care a whole lot for classical country, but our family has had this album ever since I can remember, and I have always liked it!"
positive,"Unique: Abstracting to connect: I've seen nothing like it. The supreme and rich acting of Binoche and the abstract cinematography and direction manage to distance the viewers in such a way from the everyday noise of a thousand feelings, enabling the viewers to taste and sense all the emotion and ideas of the characters and the era with a vividness only accesible in dreams."
negative,"Terrible customer service: I'll admit, I mistakenly bought this item without reading all the details, which I rarely do. I knew nothing about different codes for different areas (stupid BTW). I paid a sensational amount for shipping thinking I was still getting a decent deal. The product showed up as advertised, albeit I felt the seller was a bit deceitful by not highlighting that this disc is not compatible with US DVD/Bluray players. I attempted to contact the seller to return the item a month ago and haven't received a response. That's bad business and deserves a 1 rating on ethics alone. Don't get duped by this seller. You won't be able to get your money back."
positive,"Holds like Glue: I bought this nearly two years ago and it still works great. It covers the entire back seat and then some of my Subaru Forester. The long velcro strips at either end and the and rubberized backing hold it firmly in place -no creeping or shifting whatsoever.The rubber-like back prevents all unpleasant liquids from getting through to the upholstery! Dog hair and dried mud vacuum off easily.Also, the sturdy material and ruberized backing prevent the cover from tearing if you cut it. I put two 3 inch slices in it to fit the seat belts through and there has been no tearing at all at the cut sites.This car seat cover will last forever! I even washed it with no problems.I wish they made them for the front!"
negative,X-Acto: We use these at our school... it will last at least 6 months... maybe a year... but never more...
negative,A disappointed basque from Oneonta: Hirigoyen should have based his book on the french basque recepies and left the spanish basque recepies to the ones who know better. I have not seen a single spanish basque dish in the book that is authentic! Hirigoyen should know that we never cook with butter and white pepper.
positive,"some great stuff here: Willie Bobo is the guy who popularized the ""boogaloo"" sound. These two CD's showcases this style from the mid 60's. It's a combination of pop, latin and jazz all rolled into one. A couple of the cuts are classics (Spanish Grease, and Fried Neck Bones). Spanish Grease is the inspiration for No-one To Depend On by Santana, almost note for note. BTW, the picture on the cover of a bodega in Spanish Harlem is a classic as well, really takes you back to a time and a place."
negative,"New material: I am a huge Clay fan, but I am extremely disappointed in this CD. The man can sing like no one else, but he had to sing songs that were less than stellar, to say the least. Give him some great songs to sing, and he'll do right by them."
negative,"Dazed and Confused: I had such high hopes for this book and I was looking forward to reading Julie and Julia. Now that I have started it I'm forcing myself to finish it. I'm so disappointed in the book I don't even know where to start. First let me say that I am a TEXAN and I love Julia Child, I grew up watching her on PBS, and this book is a Total let down. I didn't expect to read about Julie's childhood or her issues with her husband and family. I thought I was going to read a diary of sorts. I'm confused as to why everyone has ranted and raved about this book. I'm more than halfway through the book and as I read on my eyes glaze over and my mind drifts and I have to force myself to concentrate on reading...I just hope I make it to the end. If you want a good read, read Amanda Hesser's ""Cooking for Mr. Latte"", she talks about Julia Child and it's a great book!"
positive,"Great Performance by Bergman: The reviewer from Auburn, WA gives a fine summary of this film. Although I enjoy watching this movie, it is primarily due to Ingrid Bergman's performance. The acting overall is good, with tips of the hat to Boyer, Joseph Cotton, and Angela Landsbury; however, I believe that Bergman really shines. To me,the storyline requires a little bit of a leap of faith, and the ""suspense"" is mild compared to other films of the suspense genre (e.g.Hitchcock, ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?""). Basically, good acting, but a little short in the script and directing, resulting in a film that falls just shy of the ""classic"" label. If you're a fan of Ingrid Bergman or the black and white films of the '40' and '50's, you'll enjoy this video."
negative,"Poor writing style defeats the message: This book has some interesting content, nothing new standard new age metaphysics, but it is, without doubt, the worst written book I've ever read. It has the tons of repetition, so much that you don't see what's new in the repetitions. Curious use of words. There is a long explanation of ""paradigm"" then the word is misused.... defeating the purpose of all the preparatory pages. If this was edited down to 10 or 20 pages it would be worth reading, but needs the work of a professional editor. But there is not enough content for the effort."
positive,Easy to understand: I bought this book to compliment my Taber's Medical Dictionary. I'm glad that I did. I found that some of the diseases in Taber's were vague and when I looked them up in Mosby's I found easy to understand definitions with lots of pictures of diseases.
positive,What an inspirational story with a great message!: What a great story! This documentary has such a compelling message and is a fun watch! Very entertaining and inspirational. I highly recommend you watch this video and share this page with your friends. The 3 C's that are lessons within the documentary are lessons that are unfortunately lacking in this day and age... the sorta of lessons that every child should learn. It's too bad that most adults I meet don't possess these 3 C's :)
positive,"Great stuff behind a ridiculous title.: If you make it past the ridiculous first minute or so of opening title screen and ""spooky"" after effects fan footage, this documentary is chock full of great stuff. As a Brian Wilson fan, I highly recommend it. Although it appears they were trying to tie something together with Dennis Wilson and Manson, it doesn't work and doesn't go anywhere. This should be re cut into two shorts. The Wilson/Beach Boys aspects and interviews with Brian are great, however. And I do recommend it for that reason only."
negative,"Yawn: I love Stargate but both movies have been average at best,Continuum is just not very engaging the actors all seem like they would rather be someplace else, the core cast is woefully under used and the pacing as with The Ark Of Truth is completely off, worst of all the storyline has been done before and better in the series."
positive,the source: This is from where Tolkien's fame came to be. Must Read it if you are a lord of the rings fan.
negative,"we have gone through 3 of these: We have had 3 of the Keurig platinum coffee makers over the past 4 years. Despite using distilled water for almost every single cup we made, the coffee maker still got scaled up. we have cleaned ours numerous times with vinegar and we have been dissappointed with the results. We love the k-cups and the variety of coffee we can use but we will be trying a different k-cup machine besides the keurig next time :-("
positive,Great One Of A Kind Music: I live in Pennsylvania and I recently saw Corvus Corax play at the PA Ren. Fair. I was quickly in love with this bands music. I bought this cd at their show and it has quickly become one of my favorites. I love rare and uncommon music and this one sure pleased me. It amazes me how dedicated this band is and how each song sounds a bit differnt then the last. This is a great cd for anyone who likes music that is a bit differnt then everything else.
negative,"Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451 is a book is filled with action and suspense. If you like a book that has many twists and turns, then you'll enjoy this book by Ray Bradberry. He tried to write about what he thought would be the worst future, with no books. They would set books onfire, because to read and poses a book is unlawful. The people believed that books made people upset, think up different ideas, and unequal. The firefighters we know now would set things on fire, not put out the fire like they do now. This book is fairly easy to understand, middle schoollers should be able to understand the vocabulary."
negative,"Disappointed in California: I eagerly awaited the release of this album, but was quite disappointed when I heard it. Other than This is the Night, the remaining songs are very plain and quite forgettable, and you will have a difficult time not skipping ahead to the next song in hopes of something better. I can't help but feel that the album was rushed to market, and that in doing so, good song choices were not made. The songs simply do not showcase Clay's singing ability and range, and many of their lyrics and melodies leave a lot to be desired. I wish I could have written a wonderful review, but unless your an absolute Clay diehard fanatic, I think that you will be disappointed with this album."
negative,Boring: I really enjoyed the other books. I too was looking forward to this one. But nothing ever happens. The descriptions are too long and the story is very redunant. I skippped over page after page until I finally decided to put it down.
negative,"Writing on autopilot: After reading this book, I felt guilty for having purchased it, because that contributed to its best-seller status. (Oops, maybe not; the way it works now, it was a bestseller the day it hit ths stores.) But it is sad to think of all the aspiring writers who struggle to get a publisher's attention for their worthy efforts, while this strangely hollow piece waltzed its way to bestseller status. Some editor should have thrown cold water on this potboiler."
positive,"excellent battery back up: I bought the Xantrex 600HD and have used it several times with excellent results. Very simple operation, the handy light, am/fm radio and the 12V car battery charger with included cables makes it a very well rounded package. In a test I made, I could run about 2 sets of christmas lights for over 5 hours and in another set up, i run an Ipod plus speakers for almost 10 hours straight. For larger loads you may need something bigger but for short time needs, this product offers great features for a minimum price. Did I mention that you may also get free shipping?"
negative,"Disappointed except for price: I had high hopes for these sheets even though I got them at a bargain price. They don't have elastic all around, which is a problem with flannels resulting in sheets riding up on the sides. They are also inexpensively made with MANY loose threads and potential for unraveling. They are thin as flannels go. All in all, try to find a better quality sheet.... it's well worth it!!"
positive,"great writing, informative: Every reader of the Frozen Republic will find something to disagree with, but if you have an open mind, you will find that Lazare has many good points about America's government not being the be-all, end-all of democracy.The Frozen Republic is a history of Constitutional (and para Constitutional) problems that America has faced and a description of Constitution worship as America's religion. There is very little on comparative government or a blueprint for change. Lazare appears to favor a parliamentary system, but he does not spell this out in any detail, or say very much about voting reform."
negative,"BEWARE -- Print in this edition is terribly small!: I was excited to get a copy of A Connecticut Yankee, since I hadn't read it in twenty-five years, but to my dismay, the print is eye-strainingly small. The story is just as classic as always, and to it I give a galaxy of stars. However, to the knuckleheads at Bantam, I have only condemnation. The print is as small as I have ever seen. My thirty-something eyes are still strong, and are aided by glasses, but I find that after a half an hour, I must put the book down. Spend a little more money, and do yourself a favor, and buy a different version of this wonderful book."
negative,"Badly warped unusable item: The body of the case is caved in on both sides of the plastic interlocking hinge, which never was fully assembled and can't be forced together. Why this item was ever partially assembled and passed on for sale, I'll never know. Pure junk."
positive,"Michael Jordan of Jazz: Kirk Whalum is truly the Michael Jordan of Jazz. His worst music is better than most artist's best. This is a very good CD, but not really the Best of Kirk Whalum. From hearing his new CD, I have a feeling that the best of Kirk Whalum is still coming. Still, I would definitely buy this CD again."
positive,"DON'T go to ebay. Nothing except bootlegs and crooks.: It costs a lot because its an IMPORT, not a bootleg! If you're going to enjoy the CD, might as well enjoy it knowing that you didn't pay too much money for a crook to burn the CD for you. Honestly. Things cost money. To a real fan, this is worth the money. Costs a crook a penny to create a mediocre bootleg. Do you really think you're saving money?"
negative,Olsen: This book requires concentration. It is not an easy or satisfying read. The TV series had an attempt at interpreting it but even that did not really work. I now know why late in my life I had never bothered with it before.
positive,"Nice cookware....for the price.: This cookware set is unbelievably nice for what it cost me.The lids are awkward, but since the lids from my last set of cookware fit these perfectly, I'm using the old ones.The pots are a little small, but the stockpot is the best---a great size and very heavy duty---this piece alone was worth the price.The handles on the frying pans are 'different', not great for storage, but work nicely when using. Both sizes work well and these pans clean easily.I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase."
negative,"XXX or ???: Director Rob Cohen hooks up with his Fast and Furious star Vin Diesel for an abrasive exercise in wall-to-wall stunts. The mindless, contrived plot well-serves the eye-popping action sequences, but only time will tell if Diesel's hip hop secret agent will replace the durable Bond franchise for the video game generation.The amazing, extreme stunts and chases make this worth considering. Extras include deleted scenes and an alternate ending.Eye candy at best and mindless FX at worst. One great avalanche and a listless, perhaps embarassed (?), Diesel can't really save this oddity."
negative,"The DVD has missing segments!: In the past, our family has purchased three videos from this series and LOVED THEM! This DVD advertised SIX segments on its cover and on Amazon's advertising, but only three interrupted segments were on the disc we received. In the end, the contexts for the stories are missing and so is one title of each segment pair intended to support the educational message. Has anyone else had this problem or do we have defective discs? We are returning ours to Amazon ASAP. and hope to get corrected discs."
positive,"Delicious, quenched all my political hunger!!!: Well I read this book in the following reasons. TO learn about more in socialism and communisms differences and to learn a different point of view. I guess this book applies to every different reader something different because it holds many values and the values can be undestood from many ways. In simple quotes many things were hidden to find out them was like a puzzle for every reader I guess. I thing this was a book that I really liked to read and also I would like to share my ideas with other readers of this book and other readers of books related to this topic."
positive,"A SPOOKY GEM: Bonnie 'Prince' Billy (aka Will Oldham) creates the scariest take on country music imaginable. In fact, this could easily be labelled 'goth country'.His lyrics are intensley personal and his voice a deep and dark wonder. His songs are carefully crafted and arranged in an obscure warmth and frailty.On some occasions the songs creep along steadily, on others errupt into soaring climaxes of double tracked vocals on the brink of collapse. These climaxes don't play on the usual tricks of severe dynamic change or string sections, but rather involve escalations in emotive force that ripple through you.Will Oldham is a master songwriter, and an expert at creating sound collages and textures not usually associated with country music."
positive,Great pictures: I saw this book at a friends house and just had to order it. The pictures are great. And the quilts and wall hangings even nicer!!
negative,"American Theocracy: Kevin Phillips makes some good points--over and over and over again. Big Oil has a dangerous degree of influence over the US and its policies. The Republican Party is in the sway of the religious right and the fundamentalists. There is a corresponding degree of clout in the southern states--reversing the reults of the Civil War. We have too much debt, in government, in families, in American businesses. All of this makes the future scary and could lead to the downfall of American preeminence, influence, etc. It happened before with Spain, the Netherlands and Great Britain. Dynastic leadership is bad for America. (OK, that was Phillips' last book, but he continues the drumbeat.) That's it, for this very pessimistic and depressing book. To me it seemed to be a literary fillibuster. Lots of data. Lots of redundency. There may be enough insight here to justify a couple of extended magazine articles. But a book? No way."
negative,"I was disappointed, too. Very.: I am new to growing wheatgrass & am very glad this was not the brand I tried first. I had been using some from healthy-eating and was quite happy with it (the only other brand I've tried so far) but decided to try this one because it is about half the price. Wish I had only bought 10 lbs. instead of 25. The grass here is very slow to grow and sparse and patchy."
negative,"All these adapters have a very short life...: This adaptor and Apple's adaptor are not going to live long. They are all pretty worthless, except for the fact that you HAVE TO HAVE ONE.I just buy the cheapest 65 watt adaptors I can find (for both 15"" iBook G4 and 17"" PowerBook G4) and plan to replace them within 6 months. Every now and then I find them for $20 - 40.00, and buy 2 to 4 at a time. Next time I'll buy a new laptop with the magnetic plug! Am very disappointed in Apple. I love my Mac, but quality is definitely going down."
positive,"If you study this subject, YOU NEED THIS BOOK!: Great, but unfortunately was only published in english. (incredible how brazilian publishers are dumb...)It develops a great vision about politics and the state role in Brazilian cinema (1900~1986), giving names, statiscs and numbers. Most important: relates audiovisual politics with brazilian politics and economy (all types, during that period, including Dictatorship)."
positive,"Michael Biehn's performance is the best part of the movie!: I bought this dvd because of Michael Biehn. His character's relationship with both his right-hand man and his love interest Ching ringed with sincerity and honesty in stark contrast to the cold and mechanical acting by the rest of the cast. I was so impressed by Mr. Biehn that I search and found his fan club website (www.michaelbiehnfanclub.com) and joined. I will be seeing him live at the fan gathering in Burbank, CA in June 2006. There are other versions of this dvd which contain additional material."
positive,JUST SAY WOW: AN AWESOME MOVIE!JUST WHEN YOU THINK THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED THERE COMES ANOTHER TWIST WHICH KEEPS YOU ON PINS AND NEEDLES. HELD MY ATTENTION FROM START TO FINISH. ONE OF THE BETTER FILMS I'VE SEEN AND ONE I WILL WATCH MUCH MORE THAN ONCE. 5 STARS FOR THE CREATIVITY OF THE WRITER. HARD TO GET OUT OF YOUR MIND FOR DAYS AFTER SEEING IT.
negative,Horrible!: I just recently purchased this near worthless software and found out very quickly that I just wasted [my money]! The music timing is all up to you!(so why did I buy this program?) They give you a chart and you must arrange the number of pictures to fit the music or else your slides end in an awkward manner without music or overrun. Yes you can adjust the time for all the slides but it's in 1 second intervals and in a 50 picture show that's 50 secondsa show you can be off by because you can't adjust each frame it's all or nothing. ...
positive,"DISNEY STRIKES AGAIN!: The legend of Robin Hood...one of the most cherished stories of all time is brought magically to life as only Disney can do!The spirit of fun and romance abounds as Robin Hood,the swashbuckling hero of Sherwood Forest,and his sidekick,Little John,plot one daring adventure after another!Robin Hood and the lovely Princess Maid Marian who have fallen in love with one another.But Robin must fight the greedy Prince John,his snake partner Sir Hiss,and the Tax Collector to save the poor people of the town. Complete with wonderful music,enchanting backgrounds,and a great cast of voices.This is a pure Disney classic that will live on forever."
negative,"Be Prepared to Keep Replacing ...: Purchased initial unit in February of 2011 - it stopped working about 8 months later. Keurig did replace it, but what a hassle to actually get through to them and then wait and wait on the new machine. The new machine died after 10 months, I'm not going through trying to get it replaced again, just a waste of time and money."
positive,as expected: arrived on schedule. I felt lucky to find for sale an item that i thought was already phased out. allows me to add more years to use of my palm m515
negative,"Adorama camera cheaters: I bought the DA-LITE CLASS MATE CEILING MOUNTED PROJECTION SCREEN, BUT GET SCREEN FOR WALL MOUNTED ONLY. AND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO USE FOR CEILING MOUNTED SINCE IT CASE LESS."
positive,Lots of action: A thrilling story of get rich quick without scruples. It introduces the reader to excellent characterizations of the individuals involved. There is excitement through unusual circumstances including an extremely imaginative ending.
positive,"From the land of Tellytubbies...: Despite their pretentious, anarchist pose, these guys CAN knock out a blooody goood toon. The title song and the intro to ""Amnesia"" merit special mention but the entire work is strewn with lively and colorful bursts of sound. Give them an ""A"" too for originality and their monster drummer. Less gratifying, but still interesting, are the snippets of dialogue lifted from British television and their mixing of curious psychological and political fantasies. Thumbs down on the silly ""Creepy Crawling"", ""Mary, Mary"" and the obnoxious Jude Abbott."
positive,"A great CD!!: i've always loved dream street and always will. the songs they have on this cd show how talented these five young singers really are. their voices have improved immensley since their first cd, though that one was great also. in these songs, their talent shines through, and each individual has a great voice (heart-melting, if u ask me). so support dream street and buy this sound track today. we love you guys and support you all the way!ps- jesse is the hottest guy that ever walked the earth!! lol"
negative,"A must NOT read: The reason this book is not well known by London readers is because it stinks. It appears to be a juvenile effort by London at a very early time in his career when he had not yet nailed down his mastery of description or characterization. I finished up Martin Eden the day before and was starving for some more London, preferably an adventure tale such as South Sea Tales. When I went to the bookstore I was excited to find a novel based on the Klondike and was able to get through about 3 chapters before I realized that I was forcing myself to read only because it was a work by London. The descriptions of incidents are choppy and bland, the conversations are dull and forced, and the manner in which London moves from scene to scene leaves the reader thinking wait, did two pages just get stuck together and I missed something??If you want to read off the beaten path London I suggest you read John Barleycorn (amazing, I felt the heat from the coal furnace) or South Sea Tales."
negative,"Doesn't measure up: Ok, before you click on the button that says my review was not helpful, hear me out. I like Clay. I was rooting for him every single week on American Idol. And this CD really isn't that bad. But it isn't that good either. I can be a Clay fanatic and say it's wonderful and perfect but technically there's really nothing there. Every song sounds exactly the same. As I listened to the album I grew extremely bored because I felt like I was listening to one very looooooooong song. Clay is great when you listen to him in doses but song after song of the same melodies with his detached and emotionless voice just gets dull. And I hate what they did to his voice in most of the songs. You can easily tell they ran his vocals through a computer. He has a great voice. They should leave it alone. Maybe in the future when he has more control over his career, if he has a career, he can do things his way.The weakest song on the album is ""Measure of a Man."" That's pure dribble."
positive,"It works: I feel compelled to write about this book. I have lost 38 lbs in 8 weeks using this wonderful cookbook (OK so the first 12 lbs were water and yes I have been exercising). The receipes are tasty and that makes a big difference. You learn a new way to cook without using butters, oils, high fat and high colesterol ingredients. Many items are complete meals without needing side dishes. I particularly like the baked french bread, stuffed peppers, baked fish, and Southwestern stuffed squash. Dieting is not my favorite activity. Food is good. My doctor's advice was to loose weight. This book has made the process worth while. I recommend this book highly. It works."
negative,"Dub of Prince Jammy treatment: Prince Jammy added synth bass to the ""Black Sounds of Freedom"" album and does the same to the dub versions here.As on the main album, the only outstanding track is ""I Love King Selassie"" with it's dub counterpart here titled ""Selassie in Dub"" which were both pretty big.For the rest of the songs, you'd be better off listening to the original dub versions on the album ""In Dub""."
negative,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR AGES 15 AND UP.: KIDS WILL LOVE IT. ADULTS WILL THINK IT'S KID'S STUFF. I CAN'T SAY I HATED IT. BUT IT'S DEFINITELY FOR THE NICKELODEON CROWD.
positive,"Awesome!!!!: This song is the best. Well, one of the best. The video is so sad. But, it's a great song. The guitar riffs are incredible. I love the song. This is truly a wonderful band and this is some of their finest work. Love it!!"
positive,"Treasure Island: When I first picked up this book, I thought it was a little boring. But after I got to about page 20 I started to figure out why this is a classical favorite of millions of people today. This is a story about a orphan boy named Jim Hawkins that finds a treasure map in a dead mans room and goes on a daring adventure that will change his life. He and the whole ship's crew go through many challenges during their voyage like mutiny, murders, and trying to fight the evil pirate (also the ships captain) , Long John Silver, that would kill his own friends to keep all the treasure for his own. This is a great suspense that you will never be able to put down. I highly recommend that you read this book."
negative,"if only it could last: This was my first mp3 player so i didn't neccessarily want anything fancy, just something with a decent sized screen. It worked pretty good for about a year. Then it began to randomly turn off. Usually when this happened i could turn it back on within a few minutes but this too ceased happening. I've now had it close to a year and a half and it cannot hold a charge at all. This would be fine if I only wanted to listen to it while it was charging, however I prefer my mp3 player to be portable. Do not buy this unless you prefer temporary dependability out of your electronics."
negative,Oooofffaaah...: Saw them live with Dredg and they stunk up the joint...badly.Don't compare them to TMV...no comparsion in any manner.
negative,"Keep waiting for a better transfer!: I love this movie. Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour, Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney Jr... what more could you ask for! The version I watched 20 years ago on the late, late show was miles better than this horrible transfer. Since this movie (incredibly) got forgotten by the copyright office and ended up in the Public Domain, all you can find are cheap, HORRIBLE tansfers to DVD's like this god-awful loser. It's better you never even watch this film than to see it in this terribe representation. Why Hollywood wouldn't want to protect gems like these is beyond me, but since they don't give a flying leotard, don't you. This grainy, blurry, audibly incomprehensible, hardly watchable transfer is a complete loser. Don't waste your money. Keep waiting for the ""restored version"" which hopefully comes out before 2021. Cheers."
positive,"Great book: This was a great book,I just could not put it down,and could not read it fast enough. Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery. this book can make you go throu several of your emotions. This is a quick read romance. It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night."
negative,"Dishes chip VERY easily: I bought 10 place settings of these dishes because I like the style. However, after owning them for less than a year several of the dinner plates, salad plates, bowls and mugs have chips on the rim. They look terrible because when the graphite color is chipped it is very noticeable since the stoneware underneath is white. I am not hard on dishes and load them into the dishwasher myself. I owned my previous set of Dansk dishes from nearly 11 years and replaced them only to update the style. I contacted the company with my complaint but they simply said the chips are from banging them against another hard surface...not true. Dishes at this price point should be of high enough quality to withstand being washed in a dishwasher. As I said, I am the only one who handles them. I am embarrased to use these dishes and disappointed in Noritakes response."

negative,"Seth: This book is really a very simplified version of the Seth ideas written down by Jane Roberts in her many books. The Seth books are much more detailed and profound, but for our fast-food society, this book is for those who don't want to take the time to read the real thing."
negative,"Programmers forgot to include tackling: In this game there is no way to cleanly take the ball from the opponent. You can keep marking/pulling at the opponent player, but he wont give up the ball. Yet when one of my player runs into the opponent defender, he gives up the ball easy. Thats my biggest gripe.Another problem is that this game is very slow on the PlayStation 2. Play can slow down if there are a whole bunch of players on the screen at the same time. It seems PS2 is showing its age with these newer games.Please dont buy this game, as you will only be frustrated with it."
positive,"A Truly Gifted Writer: I will forever treasure this book. I only wish I had discovered Carson McCullers 20 years ago while an eager English Lit student ... what an inspiration it would have been to know back then that a fellow 23-year old had written such a wise, compelling novel. The cast of characters in ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"" will stay with me forever."
negative,"Go Haunt Yourself!: This movie stinks. It's like watching a WCW Pay per view from that time. This film was ruined by cartoon ghosts,dumb subplots and a Disney-style good vs evil storyline. The acting is not that good. It also has too many pointless cast members & moments. The effects are laughable to the 4th power. The story is childish like See Spot Run. It's buildup is soo backwards. The worst part is when Owen Wilson gets his head cut off by that lion's head statue swinging by. I give this film a -0 out of 10."
negative,"BEWARE of this SELLER!!!!: Beware of this seller. They only shipped 1 of 12 items. They never responded to any of my various emails. I was supposed to receive a 12 pack of post it notes however,I only received 1 pad."
negative,"Fahrenheit 451 review: The book, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is a perfect example of a science fiction book. This book is about the life of a fire fighter named Guy Montag who lives in a futuristic city where books are banned. The job of fire fighters in his view of the future are to set books and the houses they are hiding in on fire. The reasoning for this is that books are said to be evil and contain many different thoughts and emotions that are considered ""dangerous"" if people are exposed to them. This book pretty difficult to read based on its challenging vocabulary and its confusing situations. I would recommend this book to people no younger than 7th grade based on the content of the book, and I would recommend it to people with a strong interest in science fiction and futuristic books."
positive,"Regina Carter., Motor City Moments, I'll Be Seeing You, Paganini After A Dream.: I'm reviewing all three Albums together as they are by the same artist; Regina Carter. Again I purchased these Albums on the basis of a 30 sec listen. They all lived up to my expectations. If anyone is familiar with Stephane Grapelli, Regina Carter's style is very similar. She really swings. I love these albums and play them over and over again."
positive,"cockateil book: Book was very informative. My son, who was the recipiant of a cockateil, read through it with fevor and injested so much inforamtion which he shares with us at the dinner table and through out the day."
negative,"Poor writing, poor editing, light on info: I am sorry to report that this book is both poorly written and poorly edited. If you're interested in investing in Dow Dogs, which is what the author touts, you'll be much happier with books like Beating the Dow (Micheal O'Higgins) or the investment books from The Motley Fool."
positive,"Movie review: Wanted to see the performance for best actress oscar again in preparation for this year's selection. Excellent movie, a reminder of what what nuclear warfare can destroy. Excellent love story with both key actor performances at oscar level."
positive,"Remembered a Great Movie: ""Lilies of the Field"" was a great movie when first released. It is still as good as I remembered. Sidney Poiter deserved the Oscar that he received."
positive,"Super Mario Bros rocks: I saw this movie in theaters the day after it came out and I loved this movie. I understand why some fans don't like it because of the changes, but I think those changes should be looked passed and respect it for what it is. Its a whole other Mario universe with directors way over their head. But the end product is amazing. I suggest everyone watch it, and those who have seen it and didn't like it, watch it again because you know what you're going into."
positive,"My son loves it!: My nine month old son loves this toy. He really enjoys turning it on and off and pressing the knob, especially the one that makes the starfish turn. He turns the music on when he wants to fall back asleep. I rated it with 4 stars because the music becomes distorted when the fish move. I would buy it again. It makes a great gift."
positive,"Wow!!: I have had this ring for two days and cannot believe the difference! I am not constantly aware of pain in my thumb and I can pick things up without wincing every time. I love that it is easy to adjust to fit tighter. My thumb joint is enlarged with arthritis so by time I get a ring large enough to go over it, it is very loose and annoying to wear. Not with this ring, it easily adjusted to fit snugly. I only gave it four stars because it does leave a black ring underneath. But the pain relief makes it well worth wearing it anyway."
negative,"buy 370lm instead: We've had 4 of these quit working in a year. None ever experienced harsh conditions or use. I played with the last one and discovered it would work if I flexed the circuit board. The 370lm has much a better rating. The one we bought works fine, hope it lasts"
positive,"An illuminating survey: Abba Eban was not only the most accomplished and articulate of all Israeli diplomats, he was also a person of immense learning and intelligence. Had he wished he could have taken a different road in life and become like his close friend, Bernard Lewis, a great scholar. Instead he made a certain sacrifice and devoted his life to the cause of helping the Jewish state come into being and survive.This nine- part series is not concentrated on Israel but rather is a survey of Jewish civilization. Eban tries to show us how Jews interacted with the surrounding world, both learning and giving to the larger native socieities. From Babylon and Egypt to the Western Civlization of the present day Eban relates a story of a small people's long journey and meetings with others.This is an illuminating survey and will give anyone who wishes to know more about Jewish life and history a real opportunity to do so."
negative,Horrible: I bought this cd at a best buy to have staind sign and the guitarist Mike Mushok Said that this CD Sucked.He went on to tell Aaron that he would let him listen to it in the bus. So on my way to the concert I put it in and I be damed it did. Just Horrible. The only value this cd is to me anymore is that it has their autographs on it. I later followed up with him on that cd and the case will be for my new copy of Chapter V. DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM! If mike says it sucks it sucks (I found out). But check out the string quartet though. It is awesome.
negative,"Paper on ""hand decorated"" box looks cheap: I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It may be ""exotic"" wood but the paper stuck to the wood is coming off the front left corner and greatly diminishes its beauty. The tea is nice but it's not worth the money, in my opinion. I knew the box wouldn't be hand painted but I thought the craftsman would've done a better job of gluing down the paper."
positive,"Fast paced- great read!: I do believe Julie Garwood is quickly becoming my favorite Romance writer. This was the 2nd one of her books I have read and I am headed to the library to get another one. But I messed up. I read Ransom and now am headed to get Secrets, which is opposite of how I should have read them. There is love, humor, sadness, adventure, etc. in Ransom. I loved Brodick being good looking but not with the the best of personalities, infact he has a hard personality. Gillian was strong, beautiful, carrying, and devoted. It is a great read!"
negative,Idiosyncratic Book: Just returned from Madagascar where French is commonly used. I speak some French but I wanted a small dictionary and phrase book. This book is certainly small but over half of the simplest words I looked up were not there whereas obscure words were. Buy a small pocket dictionary instead. It will be far more useful than this idiosyncratic book.
negative,"disappointment - where was the editor here????: I enjoyed the first four books, but couldn't believe this was written by the same author. Slow, painfully repetitive, and WAY too long for very little plot development. I made myself finish it (skimming the last half) just because I wanted to know ""what happened"" - in case there's a next book. Not sure I'll even read any next book at this point unless the author and editor make a concerted effort to trim. Also not sure why author has to make Ayla the inventor of all human advancements - first to tame a horse, first to use a spear thrower, first to use a sewing needle, etc. Talk about a Renaissance woman! Makes the character that much more unbelievable!"
negative,"Never buy this product it's a wast of money: HI All,Never ever buy this product you will lost money and it's a wast of time.........leacking after a week. fix that than find another leaking...till u trash it..and get rid of it..i have the pic and i paid for it $60 worth nothing zerrrrrrrrrrrrroooooooooooooooo."
positive,"Great Content, Bad deliverable: I recieved the book recently and got cracken. The content is very satisfying and to the point. Their is no secrets or wondering what is going on it is all spelled out neatly. However, I am a [meticulous] person when it comes to buying things new. The book was delivered in squashed and compacted box that crushed the lower corner of my book. I payed for a new book and not a used one. Other than that the CD is very good. Everyone will enjoy it and learn from it."
positive,"the best robin hood movie ever.: this is an old animated robin hood movie where the characters are animals.robin and marion are foxes.the taxman is a bear.so is john.the poor are mice.the kings a lion.you get the idea.robin robs from the rich and gives to the poor.the sheriff gets jacked and eventualy the folk hero has a duel with the king himself!the kids like it.i loved it when i was little.its a wholesome family film.its a true story so thats a plus.the kids will be educated and entertained.some of the scenes of the patheticly poor people a bit much for some kids.i guess the message is rob from the rich and give to the poor.but,wouldnt that just make the poor rich.soon hed be stealing from them and returning it to the king anyway."
negative,"its not good, its really worse, why?: Am sorry to say. you don't need a rate, if ask me concerning the rate! its really worse! why? because I order this netgear wg111, but without CD installer, am getting insane to install and i cannot use, when i ask the CD installer, you sent me the SpeedBooster not compatible on Netgear WG111, and I sent it back to you, but my payment you did not sent me back, until now you have my payment, am sorry I cannot trust you, what I experience in your handRodolfo"
negative,Fool me once: I had an old Xantrex which I had for 3 years and used a number of times. The jack from the a/c plug corroded and wouldn't charge anymore. I figured maybe it was because I left it plugged in all the time. I bought this one in Oct 2007 and never used it except to see if the features were working. Now when it is plugged in the alarm keeps ringing all the time.I never should have come back for seconds. I see Sears has a die hard one.I am going to look into it. At least Sears backs their products.
negative,"Horrible Quality: Even though the song list looks impressive, don't waste your money on this one. This is the poorest quality sound I've ever heard on a CD.Being a Nirvana Fan, I have other albums that sound great, but I can't recommend this one.Again don't waste your money."
negative,"Review of book: I didn't care for this book at all - in fact, I stopped reading it several times because it droned on and on about the writer's depression - so much so, it made me depressed! I wanted to read about her recovery - and after more than half of the book behind me, I was still looking for that. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"
negative,"Uninvolving, Disappointing: I eagerly anticipated the new King book as I always do when one of his books comes out. Sadly, ""Dreamcatcher"" was just not up to par. The characters are fairly interesting, but like ""Gerald's Game"" and ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" there just isn't enough to keep the reader interested.I felt that this book had a lot of potential, but was completely destroyed by rambling writing and tedious attempts to gross the reader out.There was so much more that he could have explored about aliens, but instead this book reads like a pale imitation of ""the regulators""."
positive,This Was Radio: I was very happy with my purchase on Amazon.com. The price was right and the delivery was in a timely fashion. The book was in great condition as listed in ad. I will check Amazon in the future for other purchases.
negative,"Another nightmare about the remove cassette message: I have had this camera for 18 months and about 2 months ago, it started beeping at me to eject the tape almost every time I used it. I went on-line and found that this is common with this camera for some reason. I was able to prevent major problems by removing the tape after each use, but that no longer works. Now I cannot record or watch any tape without it forcing me to remove the cassette. I was very fond of this camera until it stopped working. I am very disappointed that I will now have to buy a new camcorder (a local repairman estimated over $200 to fix it). I have a friend who has the exact same camera and he has yet to have a problem, but it isn't worth the risk."
positive,"Eragon: I havn't finished this book yet, But I think this is a great book!! I think some of you people out there are being way too harsh on Chris Paolini. Sure he may have plagurized a little, but who doesn't?! He did have some very original ideas. Overall this was a great book!"
positive,"Great Book On Endo!: Kerry-Ann is able to take a lot of the mystery out of this disease. She breaks the informaion down into bite size pieces that are easy to understand. Her book is full of ""lightbulb moments."" Things began to make sense and the ""light came on"" a number of times as I read the book.I suggest this book to any person dealing with this horrid disease."
positive,"Helter Skelter: I was 16 years old the summer of 1969 and remember it vividly. I didn't read Helter skelter until I was 22, when it first came out and learned for the first time many of the detail, and the book truly stays in your mind. That is what most of the other reviews say that it haunts you for many years and you actually feel that you are there on that hot summer night, Sharon and Jay talking in the bedroom and a strange woman walks in and orders them to the living room. How terrifying could it have been for Sharon watching Jay die in front of her and Frykowski and Folger fighting for their lives knowing very well her unborn child and her couldn't defend themselves. Bugliosi wrote with such compassion for the victims and we can truly thank him that these people are behind bars now. Watching Charles Manson talk on television shows how unremorseful he is and will always be."
positive,"Sheer Brilliance!!!!!!!: Orwell's 1984 is certainly one of the greatest novels ever written. It is more than the socio-political commentary, on which many other reviewers have focused on solely, but has an enchanting love story weaved seemlessly in to it. I apologise for my 'flowery' style, but I can not speak highly enough of this novel. It is also written to think about, not just to read. I read a review which stated that the novel had a sad ending. Once you have read the book, ask yourself 'When is Winston at his most happy?'. That is the books contradiction, and its achievement."
negative,"Too esoteric...hard to follow.: I am a graduate student in organizational development. Although this book has some good underlying concepts, I found most of the book hard to follow and not very engaging. It was often difficult to see how many of the concepts actually apply to organizations. There may be good ideas, but they often get lost in the rambling chapters."
negative,"Should Have Put This One Away For A Few Years: Unfortunately, there is nothing unique about this book. Characters are poorly drawn, action is predictable, language is overdone-ie what you would expect from an inexperienced author. Mr. Paolini should have put this one away on a shelf for a few years, then reexamined it. I'm sure he will agree in five or ten years that this was a good first effort, but not publishable material."
positive,season three of The Facts of Life series: Daughter loves this series even though it was made over twenty years ago. I'd recommend to any parents who have kids who love tween series.
negative,"Poor DVD Quality - Not Able to Watch: We bought several seasons of Weeds during after Christmas sales last year. It took as a while to get around to watching them. However, on at least THREE seasons, the DVDs were damaged beyond being able to watch. Buying the seasons was such a WASTE since the DVDs are worthless. I do not recommend buying these DVDs. I have never had trouble with other DVDs purchased from Amazon."
positive,"Clay makes us proud!!!!: Anyone that knows the type of person Clay is from what we have all read, heard or just know deep down inside, will see that this Album is perfect for Clay. Each song has a different beat, they are all wonderful clean songs. They are about love and life. Clay hasn't let me down, he makes me proud of him. I loved each song. I can't say which one is my favorite because they are all so good. The music from Clay is going to be different, and special. Refreshing from all the hard, dirty music you hear now a days on the radio. That is how I feel about it."
positive,Good buy: My 3 year old enjoys playing in this tent. It was easy to assemble. Took two of us less than 10 minutes.There was a minor thing though. Once my 3 year old's hair got tangled in the zipper while trying to enter the tent. Luckily we were able to untangle it without any harm done. Now she bows down real well before entering the tent.Other than that...it has been fun.
negative,"2.5 stars.: A non-sequel, really. This movie ignores its roots, which are suggested in the title, and travels along a bizarre path. There's no Michael Meyers in this movie. It does have is share of creepiness, but suffers from the absence of John Carpenter's directing and creative force.Rental only."
negative,"Plays like it was adapted from a video game.: If you like non-stop action, care nothing for story or character, and enjoy watching digitized monsters die in a variety of ways, this is the film for you. Otherwise skip it.Brendan Frazier's son has been kidnapped by a powerful, ancient being. In order to save the boy, Frazier must take on countless hoardes of bad guys in a variety of locations. He mowes through them like a superhero from a video game, and despite the non-stop action I found this film almost as dull as watching someone else play Quake for two hours."
positive,"Now I'm confused ;-): I read this book 24 years ago, after having just gotten out of an abusive relationship. Reading it helped me tremendously in understanding what my ex was doing. That's what I remember about this book. So, now reading the reviews, that all mention the book being about valium addiction, I'm kind of surprised that I only remember the parts that resonated with my own life at the time. To me this book was extremely powerful and I've recommended it to other strong women that have been in emotionally abusive relationship. So, I think I will have to reread the book to see, if the abuse was really only such a small part of the book and not really what it is about."
positive,"I love Sister Souljah: This book is a must read. Sister Souljah comes live and direct. Nothing sugar coated. This book is the real deal. Any black woman can probably relate to everything in this book, especially the different relationships she encounters. Go grab this book my beautiful people!"
negative,"Yuck!: Absolutely disguising, I had to hype myself up to swallow it down and it didn't even work for me. If there is a pill form, try those because this was GROSS"
negative,"No one is fine!: It's not fine! It's totally boring. I can't believe I paid full price for this lame film. Robert DeNiro, who would have thoughtNo one is fine! Everyone in this movie will put you to sleep. The story is long, drawn out, and a total bore. With a great cast who would have guessed. To be honest I couldn't tell you what the movie is about. All I can remember is I had to watch it twice because I kept falling asleep. The holidays aren't the same since Deniro's wife passed so he sets out on surprise visits to his children. He seemed to be an unexpected intruder to his own children. The movie could've been better if it were humorus instead of dramatic. This movie was not fine."
negative,jump the shark: A GIANT DANCING SPIDER???? all time worst tv ever.... and they got rid of the hot blonde chick! are there any straight men in your target demographic? or was amanda just jellous?
negative,"Reviewing the group rather than the record: A new record is out, and I want to know if it is good. I already know the previous work of Moby Grape and I do not need Sam King telling me how good the group is. He is right but redundant. I want to know if there is anaything new on the record that I have not got or heard. From reading the 8 reviewers, I see no mention of any new material. I assume that everything on the record is recycled from the original releases and several previous compilations. A proper review might then begin with: ""why does anyone need this. The second hand stores have copies of the previous compilations."" The next issue is why the record company did not release something new, like the Amsterdam concert. Should record companies be rewarded when they have such conservative release policies. Why buy these songs again? Foolish, right."
negative,"They are the has beens and wanna bees: hmmm...just think....Noel, a brilliant man, maKING A CD that is just crap. What happened!!!!! I can't believe it....over played solos....awful lryics!!!!! Just when you think they could make another brilliant album, they make a crappy album. Haaa...just think.... 4 yrs ago Blur was being called the has beens because Oasis brokoe the US but blur did not. Well....who are the has beens now??? Well Oasis... all I cam say is RETIRE!!!! Geesh, for Beatle wanna bees, I would expect better."
positive,"I just love this movie: I just love this movie -- if I have to watch tv with the kids, this is my choice. It gives models for great virtues:+ innocence+ trust+ defending the weak+ good manners+ patiencethe little mice that sing and talk at the opening/closing of each ""Chapter"" are hilarious.The movie has no dark and scary parts -- my kids are still too little to handle much suspense. It is a gentle and sweet kids' (and adults') movieand I get a big kick out of it.And Babe engages in NO SASS at all. NONE. Hooray!Language note: One ""my God"", several ""stupid/idiot/moron"", and one ""butt-head"". Thought you should know. We handle that by watching together so I can remind them: ""we never say that."" ""We know, we KNOW, Mom!"""
negative,"Yup, it's LIT: I was searching for the words to review this book for you, so I was scanning through other reviews to see if anyone else had the same feel for it I did. Then I read this: ""Every woman, every man should read this book it gives great insight on the insecurities of women. From sentence one I felt like Isadora Zelda White Wing spoke to me of my own doubts and emotional struggles. All of a sudden I was not alone...I was not lost, her journey was mine and mine hers.""And I realized that this was IT. THIS paragraph was exactly why I can NOT recommend this book. Wish I had read this before I bought it. Oh, boy does it ever ""gives great insight""!! You will hear over and over again about how tormented Isadora's life is, how confused she is. So tormenting of me that I had to put this book down. Tried to pick it up again and again, just couldn't get through it.For those that enjoy this style - enjoy in good health with all your emotional struggles!!"
positive,"Good, but not their best.: I still think Arms Around the World is, to date, their all-time best. Blaze is creative and fun, and even though it is ""praise and worship"" it is still plenty original. And they have at least gone back to their original sound, which is where they sound best. Still yet, none of their stuff impresses me quite as much as Arms Around the World."
positive,"YDS-10: The YDS-10 allows me to use my iPod very nicely on my Yamaha receiver. So far I've used it only with the iPod in manual mode where I control the iPod from the controls of the iPod itself. In this mode everything has worked flawlessly - playing, charging, sound quality has been excellent. Can't comment on the remote control operation however as i haven't had a need to try it."
negative,"Not Actually Available: Tried to watch this using our ROKU (we've watched other amazon content this way), but when you try to watch, it says content not available. Annoying since the easiest way to search is online. Back to the search."
negative,"a cheap trashy romance novel: My friend gave me this book since she knew I liked historical novels. Let's get one thing straight. This is a fictional account on some historical and empirical facts. So with that in mind, this book is nothing else but a harlequin romance novel. If you enjoy this genre, then you will like this book."
negative,"False information on hatching: I was at first glance very impressed and about to order this book due to the photos. However, the ""inside pages"" tells something to the effect of ""my mommy just laid me and will take care of me until I hatch."" This is incorrect information, especially in relation to Emperor Penguins. The daddy is who ""as soon as the egg is laid the scoops it up from the female. He places it on top of his feet and covers it with a thick warm fold of belly skin, which is rich is richly endowed with blood vessels.""My kindergarten students love to learn about penguins and normally I really like the DK books for their realism. However this is one book I won't purchase now due to false information."
negative,"Hostile Packaging: I am just getting started. Took me several minute just to open the package. This is one of those welded clear plastic packages. Just cutting one or two sides of the package is not enough. With it's 3d standing plastic shape it is even harder than a normal welded plastic packaging. At least for web / mail orders, it would be desirable to minimize the packing, reduce waste, save blood, and save time. Now to actually try the product."
positive,"doubleplusgood: it moved me to tears and no book has ever done that, it was very deep. very scary because its pluasable"
positive,album is great: this album is great. Johnnie has beautiful voice! Lyrics are great and the vocal melodies are perfect.
positive,"As good as Harry Potter and Lord of The Rings!: This book was great! I found it as interesting as Harry Potter, or Lord of the rings! I want more! This book ranges from everything from slight romance, to epic battles with ferocious monsters, like urgals, and their giant realatives, kull. It has very intense moments, and anyone who thinks that it stinks obviously has no taste in a good book! Eragon has a dragon, saphira, and uses her to fight the king, Galbotrox's army. Shades, evil and powerful wizards, Raz'ak, deathly birds, and many other fiends challenge him, and his many companions in the book. It is full of tragety, and cheers of victory, and surprises at every turn! This is no doubt one of the best books I've ever read, and with Amazon's great low prices, you can't beat these great deals!"
negative,Not crazy about it: I did not really enjoy this book. I could not connect with the characters. I thought that the book was very annoying and some of the part bothered me. It seemed very unrealistic.
positive,"Delicious: This is a wonderful, quiet and relaxing CD that I find Iput on quite often. MB has a wonderful voice that canjust about sing anything. If you want good music try thisCD and then look up and find the rest of his music. Hewasn't awarded England's top male singer in the past 25 yearsfor nothing. He certainly is my favorite singer and I willcontinue to purchase every album and every video he puts out."
positive,"This is a Great Book: The last 200+ pages of this book were fantastic, including the night scenes in town. I have not read English poetry and therefore was lost for an earier 200 pages. Joyce's references to Parnell were interesting, as was the singular reference to U.S. Grant. Leopold Bloom is an example, I suppose, of the exception to the single mindedness of these Irish people. Dublin was a lovely city, however, clearly not diverse enough for Joyce. I liked this book for the exposure given me to the English language. Joyce was a master with the pen (as was Paul). Do I read Finnegan's Wake? How can I not?"
negative,"DO NOT PURCHASE: I purchased this vacuum because...hello...it is a Hoover and I have had a fantastic Hoover for many years that just cut out on me. The problem is that this vacuum does not work well at all. I purchased it last year and intially it seemed to pick up some of the apparent and apporpriate sized litter on the floor, however, I watched as over time my carpet became more, and more bogged down and soiled looking. Now a year after purchase, it will not pick up anything. It never had enough suction to be very efficient. I am very disappoited and do not reccomend that anyone purchase this product."
negative,It was not the greatest book: We did not think that the book was very good because up unitl the last few chapters it was soooooooo boring. It took a while for the book to get interesting. It was very disturbing to see 11 and 12 year old boys wanting to kill each other and hurt each other. We liked how there was a lot of symbolism in the book and how it related to what was going on in the time period in which the book took place.
negative,"I should have listened: Well, Amazon did it to me too - the picture shows the remastered version and I ordered on that basis, but today what do I receive? The original version. Sending it back today for a refund. BestBuy, here I come."
negative,"Disappointed: The ring sizes run much smaller than the usual and the ring is so wide that you can't close your hand when it is on. Returning the item was even more difficult. While I returned it within one week of purchase, it took 7 weeks and a complaint filed with Amazon to get my refund. If you do purchase from this seller & ultimately have to return something be very sure you get a tracking number or receipt confirmation. Without that I would still be waiting for my money."
negative,"poor: I was not happy with pampers diapers. I was using huggies before and after I switched to pamper, there were more leakage accidents. Plus the side wings broke couple of time while putting on diapers. So overall I was not happy with the pampers this product. I had used pampers with my first child few years ago and they were fine."
negative,"Let's be truthful: Let's be frank: This is a terrible movie. Racial stereotypes, as one might expect from 1943, abound, and they are demeaning to say the least. The plot is so weak it barely exists. The acting is dreadful. The choreography is lousy. And the heart of the love story is between a 65 year old man and a 25 year old woman. As for Robinson's dancing, well, the Nicholas Brothers are the stars in this regard. And what exactly were Cab Calloway's talents? There is a positive side to the movie: It is Lena Horne. She's a delight, and there are three standard songs in this film. Horne deserved better, and in time her great talents would be recognized. Stormy Weather should be seen in its historical context: Blacks were needed in the war effort, and this was a very rare nod to some of their entertainers by a major studio."
negative,"ho hum: If you're looking for porn or something to see, this is NOT it. These are not real fights, but amateur boxing (most of the girls have never boxed before) with 3 rounds each. After the 1st 30 minutes it's a bore."
negative,"Unabridged?: I made it to chapter 8 in this book when lo and behold it skipped all the way to chapter 13! I was horrified because I am really enjoying this book. I searched the entire book, and this is only place where pages are missing. Does anyone else with this very book (ISBN 0760750920) have the same problem?"
negative,"Not what I expected.: I just saw this for the first time today and I must admit, I'm disappointed. I didn't get many laughs from it, I heard it was really funny. To me, this is a recycled version of The Wedding Singer, but it's much, much worse. The Wedding Singer was actually good. Nothing new here."
negative,Warning: Same book Under 2 Titles: This book also appears under the title: An Opened GraveSame author. Annoying to get the same book twice.
negative,This was the worst book i ever read: this was a terrable book dont read it has no plot or story line and you will hate it dont waste your time or money
positive,"Friends BSC Forever:Welcome Home,Mary Anne(#11): Love it!Mary Anne house just got build.And Sunny, came to Stoneybrook to visit.This is a good buy and a very good book.Lots of Love,Fulliem Quach xoxoxoxoxoxo"
positive,"3.5 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Without question the best horror film to come out in the last decade (not that it's had much competition), The Descent takes a little time to develop an interesting (and all female) group of friends before plunging them into a situation that would be terrifying enough even if there weren't creatures to worry about; if you like horror and haven't seen this film then you should be ashamed.Note: Please watch the unrated version/Director's cut for a much better ending"
positive,"A Good Introduction to Programming...if you have time: If you are a beginner who is serious about learning computer science concepts and Java basics, this book is a good choice. However, it is a book that takes time to work through. Just to keep in mind, the objective of this book is not to teach Java specifically, but programming. So it is not a good choice for one who knows another language or one who is seeking a reference book on advanced topics."
positive,"The book was good but the test bank was down: I thought that the book was a great review for the test and saw much of the material on the test. However, the test bank was down the week before my exam which was when I wanted to do the questions. That was very disappointing, but I did the test questions on the AAFP website which were both helpful and provided CME credit as well.Addendum: I just got my scores today, and I rocked the boards! I ended up in the 95th percentile. I also attended a course, but I felt that this book really put me over the top. It was great at some of the esoterica on the boards. My only beef is that I could not gain access to the online questions at all. Mine did not come with a CD, you had to log onto a website with a number provided in the front of the book. The week before my exam the website was down completely. I ended up not needing it, but it did stress me out right before the boards. Good luck and buy this book!!!"
positive,"Well-written but very graphic: 100 years of solitude is an extremely well-written novel. The town of Macondo is personified through the Buendia family. It was the Buendias who founded the town and their lineage that is followed in the story. The town (like the Buendia family) is a desolate and solitary place that rapidly matures until it is destroyed. From the founding of the town, to the installment of the banana company, to the town's destruction, Macondo is destined to remain in solitude. Like the Buendias, the town never really reaches its full potential. Although the novel is extremely graphic and somewhat depressing at parts, from a literary point of view, 100 years of solitude is a fantastic novel."
negative,"Be aware of ATI products: I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great. I have quite extensive experience with PCs (I have put together over 100 of them) and it took me 6 hours to make this card work. I would give it more stars but..... First of all, when I bought it, it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included. Well it wasn't, instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I wasn't able make it work. Secondly, when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers. I would call them but they charge you over [X] a minute for support. So the bottom line don't count on any support from ATI."
negative,"Belkin F5D6130 No web user nadme and password: Works great out of the box. Problem is you can't configure it using the web based interface. You need the wizard...that's a problem the manual is worthless. Everyone withing a 500 radius of you will enjoy their ""free connection and bandwidth"" and that sucks."
negative,"Hmmm....Nope, Not Feeling It: ""Vivrant Thing"" was a big disappointment for me. I love A Tribe Called Quest and hearing Tip resort to this just tore me apart. Tip's lyrics are way too simplistic and trite and the beat is somewhat catchy, but annoying. I got Amplified and turned this up loud to see if I'd get up and dance, but no. It didn't do anything for me. Maybe if he came with better lyrics and added something to the beat, ""Vivrant Thing would have been fine. I hope Tip will come with better material in the future."
negative,"Not good with long-haired pets: This vacuum has lost of great features, but I was disappointed to discover that it's not good for people with long-haired pets. My dog's hair clogs the hose and the canister and it's a pain to get out. Don't get this vacuum if you have a pet with long hair!"
positive,Haol Books: I bought these books for my 13 year old son Logan. We've been looking everywhere and couldn't find them. I loved the fact that I was able to find the books quickly on Amazon plus they were in a gift set and then I also pre ordered the next gift set. My son keeps telling me about the story (like I know what goes on in Halo) but the first book from what I understand is the story of the characters before the first Halo video game. The price was good. You can't put a price value on reading but to see my son reading something he enjoys versus playing video I'm happy.
positive,"Good, but Columbian Exchange got there first: Thirty years ago, Alfred Crosby published The Columbian Exchange about the populations of both hemispheres, communication of diseases, and long term implications of the initial contact in this rich, readable, scholarly work. 1491 is a knock-off of the previous work, just as DaVinci Code lifted Holy Blood, Holy Grail. Everything old is new again--just give credit where credit is due."
positive,"The Rumors Are True - This is Amazing!: Imagine how I felt when I found out that my favorite novel, Brideshead Revisited, was made into a first-class TV mini-series with almost 14 hours of footage. I read the Amazon reviews and decided that they were good enough for me to spend the exorbinant amount to buy it. It was worth it! This collection of DVD's is almost word-for-word faithful to Waugh's masterpiece and brings it alive beautifully. I've watched it like ten zillion times. Highly recommended!God bless those weird Brit's!"
negative,"Diapers are great Amazon not so much: The diapers were great. I made the mistake of signing up so Amazon would send me diapers every month. I canceled, because my child is know potty trained. Amazon still charged me for the month of October and I have been trying to get them to fix it for 5 days. Everyone keeps saying that my card did not get charged when it did. I can't find anyone that can take care of my issue and Customer Service does not seem to care."
negative,"A Waste of Time: This book was a WASTE OF MY SUMMER VACATION! I had to read it for school and I'm going into 10th grade which doesn't make any sense to me. The plot seemed to be directed at 4th graders but no 4th grader would understand the language. I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously). He even stole some lines from Shakespeare! All he did was write it, and the writing was unbearable. Unless you enjoy mind-numbing boredom, don't waste your time on the Sword in the Stone."
negative,"Why does author bother?: I picked this book up because I love Jane Eyre and had a renewed interest after seeing the excellent Masterpiece Theatre version last month. Emma Tennant has written a few sequels to Pride and Prejudice which were terrible, but I thought I'd give her yet another chance. This book was so bad, I didn't even finish it. Too many narrators, characters inconsistent with the source material, idiotic storylines, etc., etc.Don't waste your money."
positive,#4 on my top 10 horror list: This movie was really good but it'll make you check your forehead a lot! See the movie and you'll know what I mean!
positive,"Reference to sold ""Merchant Marine""is not a person's title: Great book but take great exception to story of person leaving the easy high paying merchant service job to become a para trooper--Nothing against paratroopers but Tom apparently did not read the casualty lists on merchant mariners especially during the first couple years of the war Sailing at time was like commiting suicide"
positive,Best Trans yet: This film drags in a few spots but its worth the waiting. This sequel has the most amazing effects of all of the Transformers. Plus it has a great storyline.
positive,Bewitched as Ever: If you enjoy reliving the little joys of childhood like I do then go for the Bewitched collection. You will be amazed how much of the the context of the show went right over your head as a little kid and you will enjoy the episodes all over again from a fresh perspective. I love these shows! Simple? Yes. Unrealistic? Yes. Magical? You bet cha' and we all need a little magic right now.
negative,"Defective c/d's: What a disappointment. I was thrilled that Amazon carried this 2-set c/d, but when it arrived it was ""unplayable"". With it's usual efficiency Amazon provided a return label, and I re-ordered the product. The replacement too was unplayable. Obviously a manufacturing error. While I was very disappointed with the product, it renewed my confidence in Amazon to stand by their customer refund policy. This is why I buy everything I can through Amazon. You can't find a better guarantee on the internet, or anywhere else. Thanks Amazon."
negative,"Keeps disconnecting from the internet: The X6 modem, when it works, is a great little modem that does everything that I need. But it will work for a period of time, and then disconnect itself from the internet. I've flashed it to the latest version of firmware, but the problem is still there.So if you are shopping for an ADSL modem, I would suggest that you to keep on looking."
positive,"Rumours DVD: The Rumours DVD is a retrospective documentary made 21 years after its release. Nothing more and nothing less. It's appeal will primarily benefit those interested in the way the tracks were laid down, the underlying emotions that led to the creation of the individual songs, and hearing bits and pieces of the tracks with the other instruments removed. It's important to remember that no filming occurred in the Record Plant (their recording studio) during the sessions. The film footage that did exist was all post production concert footage; sound quality that is poor by present video based audio standards.With that said, those interested in learning how one of the most emotionally charged albums in Rocks history was created will find the DVD very gratifying. Those looking for film footage of the songs being played in their entirety will be disappointed."
negative,Get ready to play pick up.: If you have large/thick wrists do not purchase this product. Each weight is a pound of tiny beads inside an oddly shaped design. Think of an oval that is thick on only two opposite facing curves. The given picture shows the thick sides but the surrounding edges are very thin.Cutting to the chase there is a high probability that the cloth will be cut or worn out very fast and you will have tiny beads leaking and spilling everywhere.Look elsewhere for wrist weights.
negative,"How is this supose to be one of the greats?: This film failed to deliver any plot whatsoever. I mean I get that the crazy family wants to butcher people, but why? Did the grandfather go mad after losing his job. Are they inbred? Is it a cult thing? All it is, is the fat kid running around with a chain saw. They didn't even show proper dismemberment. And that girls screaming! You couldn't hear a word they were saying over that constant yammer. It isn't a terrible idea for a movie. Family out in the boondocks are depraved and feed off the living. It really had potential. Instead half the movie is them ridding in the van, and the other half is the fat kid running around with a chainsaw."
positive,"Definitely not another sister tale...: To the author -- THANK YOU for something different! I'm at the point where I can't read another book about three, four or five Black women and their silly relationships. SKIN DEEP was skillfully written and I enjoyed the multicultural theme. The twists and surprises were so well done that I couldn't quite believe this was her first book. I've recommended this to several friends and the best part is -- the book is not expensive. You won't have to plunk down a hefty $25-plus to enjoy this realistic slice of life. Great job, Ms. Cross! I'm looking forward to your next book."
negative,"too much fat: This book has some good information but you have to wade through the fat to get at it. It may be written mainly for aspiring college students, but I feel it is not complete enough or deep enough for parents. There are many other better books out there on the subject (notably Fiancial Aid for Dummies and Discounts and Deals at the Nations best 360 colleges)."
positive,"A MODERN CLASSIC: ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is as shocking and gruesome as it's title suggest. First time director Tobe Hooper has an undisputed talent for creating mind numbing tension that explodes into extreme violence. ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is a harrowingly effective horror film. Due to the low budget, it has a raw, gritty documentary feel to it. It's as if your watching actual footage tooken during a night of torture and mutilation. Tobe Hooper films the story with an unflinching brutality that will make you shutter. I feel it is more than approrpriate that ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY named ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as runner up for the all time scariest movie, second only to ""The Exorcist"""
negative,"Disappointed: I am so disappointed with the Eebee DVD. I bought it based on a review in Parents magazine, and also from the reviews posted here. I feel Eebee DVD's are geared for first time parents, when their babies are just starting to move around. It gives you some great ideas of things to do with your new explorer. My 16 month old is an avid Baby Einstein watcher (LOVES them!) and was not interested in this DVD AT ALL. Not even little Eebee himself could hold my toddler's attention."
negative,Very Dissapointed: This is a book that has a chapter on the Breed itself. Great Pictures of Bassets. And then it is a general dog Information Book.I was looking for a Book that would be much more specific about Basset Hounds and not a product catalog.
positive,Great price: Great price and excellent shipping...arrived on time and very happy with the fit/install on my son's Polaris 300. It was easy enough that he helped out. Good times
negative,"I Support What She Says, But I don't believe It: I read ""No Disrespect after reading ""The Coldest Winter Ever"", and finding that work of fiction riveting, and well -told. I found ""No Disrespect"" a non-fiction work that is told with the caveat - I will tell the truth, and the names are changed only to protect the innocent"", to be poorly told, hard to believe, and self serving. Yes, I do believe it is possible to have morals and values as SS describes herself to have in this work, but the stories she writes, rather than honest, smack of someone that is holding back, or more to the point someone tailoring the story to conclude in an ending that is suitable to them. I don't mean any disrepect, but I don't buy it was the prevailing thought as I read her story."
positive,"All Time Classic!: This would have to be one of the alltime most exciting moviesJohn Wayne ever did.In this movie Wayne plays the role of a character who is based on the life of Red Adair a legendary oil well fire fighter from Texas. Excellent supporting roles are also played by Jim Hutton,Katherine Ross and Vera Miles.In thismovie you are treated to some extrodinary oil well fires.Wayneand Hutton fight these monster oil well fires all over the world.The special effects that are employed to put these fires on the silver screen are extrodinary.Wayne plays the role of Red Adairvery effectively. This is a very good movie that you will enjoy.Buy it and watch it."
negative,"Worst quality I've seen in a long time: Pretty cheap for a Hi8 camcorder, but quality is unacceptably poor. The zoom lever is hard to operate, and when you put in a tape the mechanism makes tons of noise, really making you nervous. LCD screen is a little flaky, deciding to quit working occasionally so you have to turn the machine off, wait 10 seconds and turn it back on. It also destroyed a new TDK Hi8 tape this past winter. I think I wasted my money, and look forward to getting a Sony this summer when I get a new job."
positive,"Great for more than just coffee!: This brewer has been great for me and my entire family. Not only did it help me get my 4 cup a day coffee addiction under control (I'm now down to one cup because I don't have to make an entire pot), but I found another use for it.I use the hot water with no K-cup inserted to make instant oatmeal. I hated doing it in the microwave because it always makes a mess, and a 1 year old child does not understand that you have to wait for water to boil on the stove. This machine has made my morning routine much more pleasant and easier!I also use the auto-replenish ordering for my K-cups through Amazon. Best thing I ever did!"
positive,"Works as expected.: I have no idea why people have given bad reviews for this product. It's an electric sharpener! You put in a pencil, the motor whirs and the pencil comes out sharpened! Not sure if people giving bad reviews were expecting the sharpener to also complete their home work for them! I am completely satisified with this sharpener because it sharpens the pencils. Look elsewhere if you are expecting the sharpener to double up as a plasma TV!!"
positive,GREAT: This was a great book. I highly recommend reading this book.Bilbo Gandalf Thorin Smauge Wargs Goblins Fili Kili Bombur
negative,"The diapers actually FALL APART.: Every night we put our 1 year old in one of these diapers, and most mornings he wakes up not just leaky, but with the seams of the diaper opened up and the absorbent material all over his clothes and skin! But since we bought so many we have had to keep using them and dealing with this disgusting problem day after day.They are fine during the day, when we change him fairly often. But during the 12 hour night time they are useless. Huggies leak too, but at least they don't explode."
positive,Great spoon set: I like that this comes with a parent spoon for feeding & one for the baby to hold on to as they are apt to do in the beginning. The spoon is not too hard nor is it gummy like some others.
negative,"Boring like all get out.: Heart of a jaguar by Marc Talbert was heart-stopping, as in animals? (and humans?) hearts were prematurely stopped. This book was about a Mayan boy named Balam. Balam was fourteen years old in the middle of a draught in the year 1200 or so, and the whole novel is about his village trying to please the gods so they would send rain. There is a lot of bloodletting and fear of forest spirits who will try to capture you and haul you off to eat you. In the end Balam?s wife to be gets snitched away by people from another village and in an attempt to exact revenge Balam kills a jaguar, which makes him superior to everyone else, so his village sacrifices him. The end.I did not like this book because it was pretty boring and didn?t really have a plot. It was also way too bloody to be in any way likable."
negative,"not impressed: It's described as ""stainless steel"", but brand new, the bottom had marks that looked like hard water stains. I managed to get them out with vinegar and water, but it has been picking up stains ever since, including fingerprints on the outside, which soap and water won't remove, more hard water stains, and heavy marks at the water line. The pot has always been hand washed and dried.Worse, the plastic handles melt and bubble, giving off that nauseating burning plastic smell. As a steamer, one would think it would be designed to withstand high heat. One handle came loose after a few uses. It is easily screwed back on, but I think it's just more evidence of shoddy workmanship.Overall this is a very cheap pot in feel and construction. Pot is made in China. Perhaps there are quality control issues, and I just got a bad one, though I am guessing the handles are the same on all of them."
negative,"Not so much...: I like Spongebob, though not quite as much as my kids. This was an enjoyable, but not exceptional DVD. Around here the measure of a DVD is the encore factor. If they don't play the hell of of it, it isn't all that. (Doesn't explain El Dorado, that gets played far more often than it deserves.) It hasn't been played a second time, even by my 7 year old who watches SB every day. I wouldn't waste the cash on this one, you'll get more enjoyment out of the endless re-runs they play on Nick."
positive,"A Masterpiece From The Master Of Fantasy: The Hobbit is defintely the book that got me hooked on Tolkien.The tale of Bilbo and the dwarves will enchant you and delight you.This book combined with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is the last word in fantasy. Any true fan of fantasy will have already read and devoured the Hobbit.Well, what are you waiting for? Go out and read The Hobbit, today. You won't be disappointed!!!"
positive,"Reading this book will give you great hair.: This is one of the best Pratchett books I've ever read. I don't need to go into details, they're already mentioned, suffice to say that I read it in one sitting, lent it to one friend and got it back from another. One thing annoyed me though, anorak that I am; at the beginning of the book Keel is buried under a 'simple wooden cross' but at the end Vimes finds himself pinned up against Keel's 'headstone'. Aaargh! Where have all the copy-editors gone? 'Nuff said. Read, enjoy and become enthralled by the Discworld."
negative,"Abridged? Decimated!: Anyone wanting to read Hodge, should go with the three volume edition. Yes, there is far too much interaction with the pseudo-science of the day, but this ""abridgement"" lays waste to whole areas of interest to anyone who would want to read Hodge in the first place. It's interesting that one of the areas where the cutting is most obvious is in the area where the ""editor"" disagrees with Hodge the most, that is the locus of ""eschatology"". The editor is a Premillennialist and Hodge, like all Princetonians was a clear Postmillennialist. If you want to read Hodge without the excess verbiage, buy A.A Hodge's ""Outlines of Theology"", which is based on the very same lectures that Charles Hodge published as his Systematics. It's simpler, yet doesn't alter the truth the way this chopped-up mess does. This abridgement is a master maligned."
positive,simply lovely: This was an unexpected treasure! I didnt have high hopes for this film but i was proved wrong within the first 10 minutes...this is a wonderful movie of the time and the cast is smashing. Not simpering mushy love story but a deep account of a beautiful love and strength. I must see.
positive,"Nine days- the madding crowd: this cd rules. with all the teen pop and rap/metal out there, you'd think that modern music has gone to the pits. but it hasn't. this is one of the greatest cds i've ever listened to. every song is beautifully written, catchy, and the lyrics easy to relate to. if you want a break from britney spears and limp bizkit, this cd is great. welcome back to the world of real music."
positive,Fabulous Cookware: This is a great addition to the 10 or 15 piece set. I have used Farberware for 40 yrs. and love them. I purchased this for my daughter who agrees with the value of Farberware.
positive,Very well researched and well written. Amazing author: Charles C Mann is an excellent historian and author. The book is a wealth of knowledge. It's not a novel or page-turner but you will definitely have a pretty authentic idea of life during these times!
negative,"disappointed: I have read Sandra Dallas's other books and loved them.This was very disappointing. I kept reading and hoping it would get better, but it did not. If it had been the first of her writings for me to read, it would likely have been the last. I am glad I saved it for last, because I really loved her other work."
negative,Music that influenced R&R: CD of terrific Blues Music Mississippi Fred Mcdowell. His rhythms created the original rock and roll beat. This CD is very early and a good representation of his style.
positive,"Rich in useful compounds (SHORT review): This book makes learning and finding Kanji really simple.I've found quite a bit of kanji. The best thing about this dictionary is ALL the compounds. I've found for Kanji for YuGi (from Yu Gi Oh), because i knew the reading for it. I've found the Kanji on Goku's gi in this dictionary because i used the radical look up method. the stroke count look up method would have worked well also because its a really clear kanji.I'd recommend this book over the Kanji Learners Dictionary. Its somehow clearer. Plus you also get the meaning of radicals, which the aforementioned book doesn't do (from what i've seen). This is useful for a chunk of kanji. There are some radicals that have are have meanings that really make sense in the Kanji that use them. These are kinds of radicals are A LOT of Kanji. so you can make better associations in your head.That said, a nice compliment to that would be a book on Chinese character history. See how Linguistics impacts our lives?"
positive,Very Good Book: I liked this book. It kept me reading at any spare moment I had. It was a page turner and I couldn't predict what would happen next. I would recomend this book to anyone who love adventure/fantasy books.
negative,Not what you expect ....: 1. Very small seeds2. Slow to spout3. 10 days and still not ready to be juiced4. Glade that I ordered only 5lb...Stay away.....
negative,"The gimmick falls flat: The gimmick of this guide to correct word choice lies in its mock-gothic style, à la Edward Gorey, with improbably passages illustrating the words defined. But the gimmick falls flat by trying far too hard. I loved Gordon's ""Paris Out of Hand,"" but in this book the mock-gothic prose is half-baked and monotonous."
positive,"A work of art!!!!!!!: This book is like a vaccum... it sucks you in for hours on end. Though its long, the storyline is perfect for anyone who loves fantasy.When Eragon finds a stone in a infamous mountain range, he hopes it would rake in a pretty penny. Unfortunatly for Eragon, no one would buy the stone and his hopes of buying food for the winter evaporate. When a group of henchmen for a tyranncial ruler set out to take what Eragon knows nothing about, Eragon's world is shattered. Only with the help of a mysterious old man, a mythical beast and unknown powers can he dethrone a traitor and restore peace to Alageasia...This book is a MUST read for anyone who is even moderatly interested in fantasy. Its great for kids who haven't found a book or series they like. Adults may find this book very good as well."
positive,"You must read this one!: Karen Hawkins is a talented and deft writer. THE ABDUCTION OF JULIA keeps you interested from beginning to end as Ms. Hawkins weaves a tale of mishaps and misadventures between two unlikely souls. The tension between the hero and heroine is kept ever so taut and the secondary characters are wonderful, likeable and potential romance characters themselves. Bravo, Karen. Great job!"
negative,"SAMPLES OF ALL THE SOWS WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.: ALL THE SHOWS ARE CUT NOT LESS THAN 15 MINUTES EACH. THIS IS A RIP OFF. WATCH IT ON YOU TUBE THOSE ARE REAL LONG ONES, THIS XENON PICTURES DVD SUCKS!."
negative,"Do yourself a favor. Read something better.: As you look around at the other, glowing reviews of Eragon, I hope you realize one thing: They are wrong.Paolini somehow got a glorified fan-fiction published-by his parents-and then miraculously found a ""big time"" publisher who knew how many people could be duped into reading a ""fresh and original fantasy""Paolini plagiarizes:Lord of the RingsStar WarsEarthseaThe BelgariadFreaking Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher!He takes classics, rips them apart, and creates a Literary Frankenstine. This book is the greatest rape of literature I have ever seen, and should never seen the light of day."
negative,"A Total Failure: If you've seen the original Rollerball staring James Caan, then you'll probably want to give this remake a miss. It is no longer set in a future controlled by corporations, it is set in the near present which is pretty much like reality. The hero doesn't hold a candle to James Caan.It does have plenty of action, if mindless action is to your taste. The rollerball arena is poorly designed which makes following the action difficult at times. The villiam is just another greedy businessman/crook with nothing to make him stand out from a 1000 other businessman/crooks in other movies.My adive? Save your money and get a copy of the original Rollerball."
negative,The Worst Quality Blu-ray ever!: I couldn't get through the first ten minutes because the quality was as if it was a DVD from the dollar store. The quality of this Blu-ray makes VHS look fabulous. I even wrote a letter to the company and got no response. I buy lots of Blu-rays and DVD's and I will NEVER buy one from this company again.
positive,"What's not to like?: Easy to read yet scholarly. Great illustrations. Space in the margins for notes. Good chapter overviews and summaries. Nice T/F questions to prime the reader. Sources used appropriately. It is truly the ideal textbook.The format, layout, and writing style make this the text that other writers should follow."
positive,"Great product, worth the nasty taste: It took me a while to get used to the flavor: very bitter. I put it in a little bit of water then wash it down with a whole lot of water, every evening. I notice a huge difference in my sleep, among other things. I highly recommend it!"
negative,"Very disappointing: After reading Wagner's other work, and especially after reading Carolyn See's enthusiastic review in the Washington Post, I had high hopes for this book. But The Chrysanthemum Palace was a disappointment, a thin sketch of a story with weak, unlikable characters and a Hollywood backdrop that many writers -- including Wagner himself -- have made much more vivid. At about page 140, I skipped the next 50 pages or so and read the last 15 or 20 pages, none of which made me want to return to the part I passed over.Wagner is a talented writer and adept storyteller, so I'm rather baffled by this tepid effort. Maybe this was just one of those mistakes that writers occasionally make in selling an idea to a publisher, then finding that it really doesn't engage them or that they can't flesh it out well enough in time for a deadline. I still look forward to Wagner's future projects, but this particular book was a waste of my time and money."
positive,Buy it: Had this for a few months now. Works great. 2 High Schoolers and a K student with a ton of color pencils working this thing constantly. Easy to clean and keeps on sharpening. A bit noisy but no big deal.Worth the amazon price.
negative,"Victim of the Loudness War: Beware! This ""Original Recording Remastered"" is grossly untrue to the original recordings. I have ""Singles 45's and Under"" on LP and wanted these recordings on CD. Unfortunately, I did not see any warnings in any reviews, from either critics or consumers, advising of the destruction of the dynamic range of these recordings. I'll have to leave this double CD in the car stereo since I can't stand to listen to it on a half-way decent home stereo system. There are so many compilations of Squeeze material available, I will have to look elsewhere for a satisfactorily sounding one which includes post-1983 Squeeze music. I suggest you do the same."
negative,"Not worth watching. Stopped after 50 minutes.: The movie started out poorly and went down hill from there. I was waiting for it to get better and realized after 30 minutes it was only going to get worse. Stopped after 50 minutes. I just could not waste any more time on this movie. If you read reviews before watching a movie and there are this many bad reviews, don't watch."
negative,"Garbage Day!: Well, if you've seen the first one, don't waste your time here, it's pretty much all the footage from the first one with about 20 minutes of horrible new stuff edited in with it. The only thing enjoyable about this movie is the incredibly horrible acting. Particularly ""Garbage Day!"""
negative,"not wedding music: *wedding* favorites??? I don't think so! Music from Fiddler is nice, but it's still Broadway. Hava Nagila may be useful, but it sure is trite--So much great other fast music, why go with that one?! Raisins and Almonds is a lullaby! Do they know something about the bride that we don't?! My Yiddishe Momme is a sad song. Not the best for a wedding. Dona Dona is a song of suffering and freedom, a song that dates back at least to the '40s and has taken folk-song status--again, not really for a wedding. So, this may not be a bad album, it's just not wedding music."
positive,"great dvd - not too accurate opening battle scene: excellent dvd and very good movie. fun to watch. I enjoyed it enormously. Gladiators fighting against chariots is one of the best combat scenes ever made and make you understand why it took so long to outlaw gladiator fights in Rome. Almost makes you want to be there and watch it live!opening battle with Germans is done impressively, but super inaccurate:Romans won their wars not with cavalry charges but with marches of superbly disciplined, trained and equipped infantry.Cavalry at that time was used only to chase and finish off routed enemy.They did not even have stirrups yet, which made horseman effective on the battle field few centuries later. during the period when Gladiator takes place cavalry could not and would not make a ""decisive charge"".and finally, in that battle German tribesmen were MUCH more likely to have mounted troops than Romans, which they don't."
negative,Bratz babyz are OKAY: A lot of people say that these bratz babyz are sooooooooooo cute but I don't think that they are that cute.My cousin Emily just got Bratz big babyz Cloe and she kept telling me and my sister that it was sooooooooooo cute.I think the baby was okay but it wasn't wonderful and she even asked me where the nose was because it was soooooooooo small.A lot of kids say that they are cute but the bratz babyz don't even have real hair and there eyes are huge. I think a lot of people just like them because they are bratz because if MyScene made the same babies that bratz did a lot of kids wouldn't even buy the MyScene babies.So kids need to stop saying there cute because if MyScene made the same babies kids that hate MyScene would say the babies were ugly.
positive,"Etiderm Dog Shampoo: I have a dog with bad enviromental allergies this is by far the best shampoo out of more than a dozen I have already tried. If used as directed, leaving on 5 to 10 minutes it works great and have even had to shampoo her less. Great product and great price on Amazon."
negative,"Tore within a few days. Heavy bed with 2 cedar bags inside.: This was the worst dog bed I ever purchased. Within the first few days, the fabric tore along the side seam and every time I wanted to move it, the cedar bags fell out of the giant rip. I can't imagine why this wasn't constructed with thicker fabric and industrial stitching. The bed is heavy and awkward to move. Inside are 2 cedar bags and 1 foam pad, so that when you move it, those cedar bags will overlap each other, then the bed has a big lump in it. You have to get those cedar bags side-by-side in there. What a pain! I purchased the large bed, so possibly this is why there were 2 bags. Also, you can only wash the thin outer bag that holds the cedar bags and foam pad inside."
negative,"Do not read this book!: It has been a while since I read this book, but I absolutely hated it. In particular, I did not like how the 2nd Zina was treated."
positive,"A Contagious Read: If anything, this book could easily be described as impressive. Just the right amount of familiar fantasy framework, making characters easy to identify with, and original ideas of magic and racial nuances, that keeps the book fresh. This makes for a great read from young adults on up."
negative,HEARD IT ALL BEFORE: YOU KNOW SOMETIME HIS MUSIC ALL SOUNDS THE SAME .DON'T GET ME WRONG HE IS VERY VERY TALENTED BUT THIS CD JUST REALLY DOES NOTHING 4 ME IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMTHING THAT HE HAS DO BEFORE HE JUST REMASTERD IT .TRY AGAIN KELLY BECAUSE YOU DID NOT PULL THE SHEETS OVER MY HEAD WITH THIS ONE.
positive,"Great Desk!: This is the best kids' desk you will find for the money. I can almost guarantee that! It comes well packaged and requires very little assembly. The wood is solid, not the cheap particle board you find in most big box stores."
positive,"BeSt The Hobbit!: This is the best The Hobbit book I could find. I t contains a lot of great extra information and drawings, plus the book."
negative,"I am returning it today....: I bought this from frys and am returning it today. Maybe it's only me, but mine had really bad quality and distorted images. I had 17"" LCD monitor from viewsonic and was replacing it because it has similar problem. Now, 19"" has same problem and I am done with viewsonic. I am not going to use viewsonic monitors again. Instead, I am going to try samsung ones."
positive,One of a kind book for timber frame building.: My husband loves this book. He said he has learned so much and that this was the best book to learn how to build a timber frame house by.
negative,"Five-star movie, one-star ""Special Edition"" DVD: Commercials on DVDs are nothing new. Annoying though they are, you can always skip them with a click of the remote, right? Not anymore. For Babe, a title targeted at kids no less, Universal saw fit to make the commercials non-skippable. They start as soon as you put the disc in, and the ""Forward"" button on your DVD player won't let you bypass them. The ""Menu"" button has no effect either. Even the ""Stop"" button won't work! Once the commercials start -- including one for the dreadful Cat In The Hat that's nails-on-chalkboard offensive -- there's no escape from them! Shame on Universal for ruining the long-awaited widescreen debut of this wonderful film. My solution: I will no longer buy Universal DVDs until they discontinue this practice."
positive,"One of the best books I've ever read: I loved the book! I had to read it for english and it was an in class assignment so we read thru it together. The 2 main characters, George and Lennie, go from town to town looking for work. most people think that it's weird that 2 men would travel together(not that way). Everyone thinks that George is taking Lennie's pay check and using to go to town and use it for the whorehouse. It had vivid descriptions and pictures that I had acutally thought I had lived and worked with them. It does have some foul language, but if you focus on the language then you will not be able to read thru it and feel the emotion. Also if a 12 year old could read it then most likely anyone could. The book covers the following topics: life in the early century (30's), racial prejudice, prostitution, and the all american dream. There's also a tear-jerking ending so be forewarned. Overall, (obviously) I loved it!!!"
positive,Interesting: I am almost done with the book. It was a book that was bought for my younger sisters. It is an interesting read and something I can relate to. I would recommend it to someone. I personally think it is for women who have not realized or found her true self and this could be women of any age. I would recommends the book to friends. The author did a good job.
positive,"One book that I would recommend: Excellent narration, epic story and it has all the elements that a reader who loves middle earth fantasies would expect! I recommend reading it."
positive,"""Chick Lit "" for ""Foodies"": What a great read = tips on cooking,lovemaking and Italian insults. Laughed and laughed. Thanks. Looking forward to film."
negative,"Boring: Just flat out boring. I tried to follow, but just couldn't.It was an attempt by the producers to impress me with the Los Angeles 1950's style atmosphere, and I'm just not impressed.Storyline was bad also.How's that for a short and sweet review. Unlike many reviews on Amazon, this one didn't take 20 minutes to think out and it told you what to expect right away.Time to move on."
positive,Enjoy: I really enjoyed this movie and I bought the soundtrack and the dvd. It is a great movie that I would be glad to compliment on.
positive,"EXCELLENT FOR NOVICE OR EXPERT: For 36 years I have instructed a wide variety of novices, experts and ""so-called"" experts. This book will take you from nothing - to all you really need to know (unless you are into ""one-upsmanship"" or trying to prove something about your masculinity or lack of it). For those (who are using this forum to display their resumes) if you are insecure then you will take your stack of books and your ego and look for anything that might have been left out. You might even list all the books you have, but the truth is, if you are really good at real-life situations, whether actual military combat, law enforcement or the usual combat games, ....all the book-learning in the world is no replacement. This book is well worth what you pay for it, and that's the point of these reviews, not better-than-thou cynicism from would be intellectuals."
positive,"Enlightening and spell binding: I read Titanic in the early part of 1997. I found the book fascinating, especially to one who knew very little of the disaster and the uncovering of the broken ship. I have recommended the book as a must read to many of my friends. Skip the movie and read the book!"
negative,"If there was a 0 I'd put it: This band absolutely sucks. All their songs sound the same the lead singer can't sing and he wants to be like the lead singer from Godsmack, but at least Godsmack makes a good sound. System of a Down makes a putrid sound and everytime I hear their song I want to puke."
positive,"An Inspiring Novel: ""Waiting for the World to End"" was a real touching novel. The characters could relate to so many people that I have met in my life. I liked the conflicts in the book between Tom, Mary, and Ben, between Tom and his mom, and between Tom and himself. For example, how Tom was falling for Mary, and how Tom and Ben were very close in and out of school and basketball. The relationship between Tom and his mom wasn't a great one because his mom always thought he could do better in life than what he had already done. Tom's conflicts with himself caused him to have a hard time dealing with the fact that he had an abortion a while back with an old girlfriend Alexandra, when to find out now that he does want a child of his own. Tom did not deal with that problem so well, so every night he would come home and he would try to drown his memories by drinking, and that caused him to have a hard time to keep a relationship with anyone. Over all I thought the book was very good."
positive,Works exactly as advertised!: There is little to say about this little item apart from the fact that it makes life with a TiVo DVR even easier and your connections and downloads much faster. Works exactly as described and is a total breeze to install. It looks very low profile and sleek and is small enough to sit anywhere (and disappear) in your a/v set up. Superb product.
negative,"Typos in the Kindle preview before purchase left me disappointed: After seeing typo complaints about the Kindle edition, I decided to look at the free initial chapters before plunking down that much $$. It didn't take me long: '...he was bom on Caladan..."" in the 5th sentence of Book One! Come on Penguin (and Amazon), either significantly reduce the price or get it right (and do the 40th Anniversary proud). Why not give the first reporter of each typo $1 credit and then fix them. I was hoping to reread the entire Dune saga (this time on the Kindle 3 when it becomes available). Now I think I'll just dig out my original hard-covers instead. Very disappointed!"
positive,Great Baby Dry Diaper: This is the best Baby Dry Diaper for your special little one. Your baby really stays dry and comfortable specially during the night and the fitting is great.
positive,"Grandfathers of rock keep on rockin!: What more can you say about the Stones?This is one of their bestalbums in a long time and is a refreshing reminder of what realmusic is compared to the slop thats out there today!Give thedisc a few spins and it gets better and better.Good ole drivingrock,a few ballads,blues and of course a few of Richardscontributions which are rough,but catchy.There are some raunchylyrics here typical of Mick and the boys,none greater than -""Oh no,not you again , f'in up my life......""Gotta love it!Buy this album,a must for Stones fans!"
positive,"It sure was a good decision to buy this one!: I had already owned Peter Gabriel's ""So"" and ""Us"" before I decided to get this fine collection of his solo material, some of which I was familiar with. Besides ""Sledgehammer"", ""Mercy Street"", ""Don't Give Up"", ""Red Rain"", and ""Big Time"" (Where's ""In Your Eyes"", anyway?), all from ""So"", my other favorites are ""Solsbury Hill"", ""I Don't Remember"", ""Shaking The Tree"" itself, ""San Jacinto"", the new-for-this-collection ""Here Comes The Flood"", the particularly strange and bizarre-lyric-filled ""Games Without Frontiers"", and my absolute favorite ""Shock The Monkey"", albeit in edited form, as opposed to the version I heard on the radio. So, now, beside fellow Genesis veteran Phil Collins' ""Hits"" CD, this is a must for anyone's adult-contemporary collection. I'd recommend it heavily!"
negative,"Disappointed: I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book as I facilitate marriage preparation workshops. ... I would agree that there are several pertinent questions asked, however many of the questions seem like they are 'space fillers'. This along with a lot of spacing and extremely large font look like an unfortunate attempt to make a 'book' ... out of something that could be written on 1-2 sheets of paper. Please don't get me wrong, I strongly believe in couples preparing for their engagements and marriages, and I believe that couples should talk about many of the subjects listed in this book, I just don't personally and professionally feel that this book is worth the money. There are many other relationship oriented books that would provide better guidance for couples as they get to know one another and prepare for their upcoming marriages."
negative,"This ain't the one...: If you are looking for an axe to take down trees larger than 4-5""... This ain't the one for you. This is a camp hatchet with a longer handle. It is to light to have enough energy to cut effectively. There is a reason this thing sells for about $30. I used to like Gerber products, but anymore it seems like cheap china crap, is all that they are selling. I have a Gransfor Brunks axe and it is a joy to swing, this thing is all work. It took 4 times as long with the Gerber then it did with the Gransfor's. I thought it would be a good back up or second axe. While it will cut wood, the effort expended is not worth it. If at all possible go for a better axe.Pros:CostSharp out of the boxCons:To lightNot energy efficient (you have to work to hard for what you get)Made in ChinaCheaply made"
positive,Great Book: I bought this book as a gift for my dad to encourage him to go for walks around the Bucks County area. The maps and content of the book are really nice and detailed. The only thing I don't like about the book is the cover. I think the cover makes the book look dated.
positive,Dont leave home without it.: The batteries fizzle on the ipaq pretty quick. You'll needthis to keep a fresh charge.
positive,Outstanding Wireless Adapter for Tivo: I needed this wireless adaptor because I don't have two cable outlets close enough together to reach an ethernet cable from my wireless router to my TV and cable splitters ruin my Internet connection. It did not disappoint. Once I hooked it up to my new Tivo I began running through the setup screens. The adapter easily found my network SID. The screen to enter the security key was simple to use. It quickly connected to my network with the WPA2 security after I entered my key. I was impressed how quickly it was able to download the settings and initial programming to make the Tivo and my TV usable. This is a great product and well worth the price!
negative,"Mankind's Greatest Cultural Achievement: Webster's dictionary:Dreck: adj. see: Allan Quartermain and the Lost City of GoldApparently James Earl Jones dedicated his salary to a group of bounty hunters charged with the task of tracking down every known copy of this film and destroying it. The effort failed, unfortunately. Run. Run while you still can."
negative,"Mediocre mythic study of Tolkien: Juggles large numbers of mythic references with some skill but not full confidence or accuracy, and doesn't really have a lot of insight. The book is also burdened with a Hildebrandt cover. I recommend David Colbert's ""The Magical Worlds of The Lord of the Ring"" for juvenile readers, or Anne C. Petty's ""Tolkien in the Land of Heroes"" for adults."
negative,"Inner pot peels off!!: I fell for these great reviews, but found out there is really nothing special about this rice cooker except for the price and the reviews to justify spending more for the same thing.After a couple of months of use, the inner pan peels off, had bad scratches. Talk about the worst customer service.I wish someone I've read a more truthful review on this product prior to buying.Save your money."
positive,"Pretty Good: To echo the other reviews, it will only keep a warm cup warm, it will not warm up a cold cup. I am certain that the manufacturers are afraid of getting sued and don't want to make a warmer that gets reaches higher temperatures. In spite of this one drawback I use this warmer everyday - I have one at home and one at work and they consistently meet my expectations. I would recommend plugging it into a timer outlet that you program to turn off at times you know you won't be around."
positive,"Blows Toxic Avenger I away: For those of you who liked TA 1, you've got to get this one. If you thought the first one was funny, then this one is gonna have you rolling on the floor. Imagine the King of Porn, Ron Jeremy, playing a priest--well, he does in this one. That irony is funny enough, but there are are TONS of other funny sh*t in this flick. This movie is non-stop from the get-go. If you like all the Troma goodies--gore, outrageousness, gratuitous nudity, a little bit of lesbo action, and over-the-top comedy--then this movie is a MUST for your collection. You don't just have to be a Troma fan to like this movie. Like I said, if you like all of the things listed above, then you should get this flick. Trust me, you won't be sorry. Just don't watch it with your grandmother or little ones."
positive,"Great for the money: I purchased one of these about 7 years ago from Sears and I had excellent service until last spring when it finally gave up the ghost. I recently bought another exactly like it from Amazon for about $15.00 less than I paid back in 2000. For this price I can not think of anything to complain about especially if I get another 6+ years from this one.I generally use it to start my lawn tractor but in a pinch I have used it to start car and truck engines as well ( 4,6 & 8 cylinder ). If I had one complaint it would be that the cables are very short, making it somewhat difficult to jump batteries that are in an awkward spot. Otherwise at $21.88 (free s/h ) I'd be nuts to whine."
positive,"Truly exceptional: A truly exceptional introduction to the Japanese language. The clear, straightforward explanations, useful example sentences for each grammatical structure, and varied excercises (with answer keys in the back so individuals studying on their own can check their work) make this an enjoyable and effective text. I would highly recommend it to those just starting out as well as to more experienced students who are looking to thoroughly review the fundamentals of the language."
negative,"Gave my baby a rash: We have always used Pampers Swaddlers and loved them, but they only go up to size 3. Now that my daughter is 14 months old, we needed to move her to size 4. I ordered an economy pack of Pampers Baby Dry diapers and she has a terrible rash. I don't think she has particularly sensitive skin, either. We've tried Pampers Cruisers before and will definitely be moving back to those. Although, I don't like this particular product of Pampers, it's the only brand that doesn't leak for us!"
negative,"Sorry I bought it: Getting past the politics was easy, but do you really need to use the f-word (constantly)in a book about Julia Childs? No passion for cooking, just vile language and classless references to her sex life. Her lack of compassion for her clients (families of 911 victims) is sad and troubling. Don't support this one."
negative,"Morally satisfying, but no more: I finished this book in a foul mood, which I eventually managed to atribute to a simple cause: lack of passion. The book simply--to my mind--has no life. The characters (with a few minor exceptions) seem trapped by expectations. I grant you it's set in a repressed time, but still, I was hoping, until the bitter end, for a flash of life. Somewhere.And I am not a romance reader, so that's not what I was looking for.... Just a small spark of life.A pretty disappointing read, in my view."
positive,"Loved This Book!: I loved this book! I graduated from high school in 1959 and this book took me back, no doubt about it. I knew a couple of girls who got pregnant while still in school, and it was as terrible as is depicted in this book. (Thank goodness for progress and change.....) This book has very strong, well-developed, definitive characters, especially the young narrator. I can still feel the book as if I lived in the neighborhood......"
positive,"Looking back: When you look back on something from your childhood and remember how absolutely spectacular it was to rush home evey afternoon to see your favorite cartoon, then revisit it in adulthood, more often than not you may be disappointed.Transformers the Movie still delivers, from its theme song to the death of your favorite characters. This was a great purchase."
positive,Fast Service and great product!: I like when a seller deliverers fast service!I use this product as a meal replacement to help me eat better and lose weight. It does everything its supposed to and it tastes great.
negative,Don't Waste your Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I bought this to shade my baby in her umbrella stroller while vacationing at the beach. The umbrella is SMALL and difficult to reposition. Definitely a waste of money. Better to invest in a more expensive umbrella stroller or lightweight stroller that comes with a sunshade.
positive,Great CD: I love this CD!! This CD has all the great songs that I love from this group. I love John P. Kee!!
negative,"returned it: I have used only an expresso maker for 15 years, and this one caused more headaches and grief in one week than my old Krups did in all those years. Water poured onto the counter, read and re-read the instructions - and I never did get one cup of coffee out of this machine."
negative,"I cannot believe...: I cannot believe that people would give this film 5 stars. I forced myself to watch the entire film just because I could not believe that someone would actually recommend this film. Yea it has an interesting twist, but it gets real painful after a while. If you love it, god bless..."
negative,"not good: Cannot say that I enjoyed reading this book, because I did not approve of a lot of the things the author included. However, I did find some of the main points interesting to create a story. But definitely not the type of good book to read, nor would I recommend it."
positive,"Nicely Done: I enjoyed this book to be sure, and although it was quite lengthy, I found myself unable to part with it easily. I finished it within a week simply because the story was so gripping. I'm not sure how Herbert manages it, but it seems that he can endlessly descibe something yet never bore someone. Highly Recommended."
negative,"Avoid if Possible!: Paul Strange's text should not be used by Graduate Students who are learning Relativistic Quantum Mechanics. Strange leaves much to be desired in his method for presenting topics and in his writing style. It seems more of a collection of his papers meant for other professors presented at colloquia rather than a coherent and understandable text meant for learning from. Purchase only if you intend to buy or have access to the numerous other texts referenced to on practically every page.I rate this advanced physics text: ""Avoid if possible."""
positive,"A Lesson in Humility: Watching the incomparable Julia prepare onion soup in this rebroadcast of her second show, I am humbled by her gift as a teacher. She delivers her lesson in 30 minutes without pause, background music, or cue cards. She intends for her lesson to be viewed by an average audience with a standard ""out of the box"" kitchen, an audience who desire to be a little more creative with their supermarket fare. This is not cooking as entertainment but for sustenance; not a fancy appliance or utensil in sight. Good food is prepared from the heart with ingredients at hand.It is Christmas time. I stumbled on this show while shopping on Amazon for another new kitchen gadget. The kitchen shopping is suspended indefinitely for I want what I already have, and the soup will not care if I use my grandmother's ancient iron blade or the latest Henkel's. Thank you, Julia, for reminding me."
positive,"Magical Adventure: Anita Jeram's book, I Love My Little Storybook, is a favorite of my 6-year-old son. The illustrations are magical and whimsical. As a reader or a listener, it's easy to wish yourself into this magical world of adventure. It's a wonderful bedtime story and has become a favorite to give as a gift to other children and expectant mothers."
negative,"Oh Will Smith, how do we hate thee?......: If you thought David Lynch's Dune was a travesty, have a look at this mess!Its got a dude, its got guns and its got stuff exploding!Avoid this trash, and read the thoughtful and non-violent book.Susan Calvin rules!"
positive,"Very satisfying and informative.: An honest and articulate accounting of the year that produced one of the finest pop albums ever made.As a musician, I was thrilled by the segments that take place in the studio with the original master tapes, breaking down the arrangements, revealing the extraordinary harmony singing, and exposing unused material.As a fan, I was moved by the almost incredible story of two couples breaking up but choosing to continue their work together. It seems that there could have been no ""Rumours"" without the angst that fueled the songs.Bravo to the producers of the ""Classic Albums"" series."
negative,"Not as Good as the Red Opener: I have the red color of this Splash bottle opener, but decided to buy the green one to match a new kitchen. The green one is quite inferior to the red opener. The red Splash contains a strong magnet under each ""petal"" and doesn't move on from a metal surface to which it becomes magnetized. However, the green opener only has magnets on every other ""petal"" and doesn't hold nearly as strong to the fridge. I don't know which was the other colors were made, but I ended up sending the green one back as it would pop up from the fridge when opening a bottle."
negative,"bummin: this cd is bad. i really didnt and dont enjoy this CD. If I were you, Id save my money for Christmas. After I listened to this CD, I was was bummin. You will B2."
negative,Moonstruck: When I received the item it sounded like the DVD had come off the lock. I gave it to my daughter for a present and she just opened it today and it is scratched.
positive,"Red Allen's hot session: Brilliant music made by old friends from the era when swing was still forming but at the same time the foundations of modern jazz were layed in Fletcher Henderson's orchestra (""Queer Notions"" and some other songs).This is a really hot and swinging Henry ""Red"" Alllen's slightly dixielandish date, featuring Coleman Hawkins (tenor sax) J. C. Higginbotham (trombone), Buster Bailey (clarinet), Cozy Cole (dm), as well as some younger but still hot players.However, the leader is particularly expressive in the ballad ""I Cover the Waterfront"" - no wonder I found it cited as one of the classical Allen's performances. Late fifties were good not only for modern explorations: this hot hi fi session gives great joy to us fans of classical jazz who sometimes whish that the recording technology in the 20's and 30's was a bit more advanced..."
negative,"VERY, VERY BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: THIS BOOK WAS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND BUT THAT MIGHT MEAN I NEED TO BACK TO SCHOOL FOR A WHILE. I AM ONLY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. YOU SHOULD GO WRITE A BOOK FOR TEENS. WELL ANYWHO PLEASE WRITE A GOOD ONE FOR TEENS."
positive,"Unbelievable: This book is incredibly good. The names were creative and authentic. And it was extremely well written. It may start off a little slow, but power through the slow parts and you will see the incredible work that this book is. A MUST HAVE!!!"
positive,"The Stranger: Traditionally this is considered a book about alienation. To me it tells the tragedy of having feelings considered alien by the society in which you live.After killing a man, Meursault is taken before people who shamelessly express their desire to judge him by his personality rather than by what he did or didn't. Even the fact that he was not seen to cry at his mother's funeral becomes an evidence of his guilt. At the same time when all society turns against him in repulsion for his diversity, we start to see the honesty and naivety inherent in his thoughts and decisions. His realization at the end is genial."
positive,"Like Butta': Heavy contruction, actually made of brushed metal, no slip foot to sit on top or in the cabinet without moving around, asthetically pleasing, nice pliable cable (not all stiff and kinked), worked quickly with absolutely no set-up (I moved the Linksys adapter I was using to my other TiVo)."
positive,"Excellent portrayal of Luther!: I've seen this movie over and over about Luther! Not only it is fairly historically accurate, it is entertaining and inspiring. My wife needed to watch this movie because of her studies at seminary. She said it was poignant, informative, and that she would be willing to watch it again, soon!"
positive,Hair Street: ... The Lounge Lizards are masters of melody with riffs slightly reminiscent of other styles and periods but never a cheap copy of anything. I dont know how to express this exactly but attempting: all the musicians seem completely free to offer their own interpretations and not limited by what some big head thinks is cool or correct (ala Pat Metheny or Wynton Marsalis). Like Miles Davis' music was always so great because he just let his players play. I have heard so many mediocre bands with the best players- the Lounge Lizards are exactly NOT that!
positive,"great: provides great support and slims me down by 2 inches when I wear it (I ordered a size small). The size chart is very accurate, it fits like a glove."
negative,"SAD BOOK/ LAPSED CATHOLIC/ FORMER NUN: WE ALL GO THROUGH JOURNIES IN LIFE, IT IS SAD SHEHAS LEFT THE CHURCH, AND EXPRESSES HER OPINION'S IN SUCH A ONE SIDE WAY. WE ALL HAVE OUR PROBLEMS IN OUR CATHOLIC FAITH. READ THE BOOK, BUT REMEMBER THE CHURCH IS SO HUGE THAT ONE OPINION CAN'T FORM ANOTHER'S"
negative,"This book is more off balanced more than our Judicial System: You can't throw out the baby with the bathwater! If you feel that our Judicial system is flawed because it is not being held accountable - wouldn't that be an argument for more checks and balances not less?So then what is this really about? I believe that the author is afraid of social evolution (as evidenced by her other books.) Although I don't understand why she is - without it she couldn't be an author, lawer, columnist, AND be the mother of six. Anyways, she would like to replace our judges with know it alls like herself. She does a good job of presenting the facts that back up her agenda, but she misses any evidence of how the system that she proposes would be doomed to fail. After all, history shows us the ugly death of all previous Theocracies. If you are afraid of moving forward, this book is for you. If not save your money for a book with more balance."
positive,"Creative and Refreshing: This was one of the best movies I have seen in years. It was fast pace and very entertaining. I really enjoy the ""ending."" The lead character Lola is awesome she is tough and also very feminine at the same time. I would highly recommend this film."
negative,"From Chase to Fallon: This book is an interesting read that is easy to get finished in one sitting. If one is looking for a detailed narrative, this book probably is not it."
positive,"good mix: Combines visualization, breathing, easy enough movement. He's low-key,straightforward, no jargon here though he strikes me as a spiritual person"
negative,"Not Durable: These folders were a good price, and I've ordered this same style of Avery folder previously from another seller for my place of work and liked them, but these were disappointing when I opened them up. The pictures on Amazon did not reveal their thinness and how flimsy they are; also, the inside pockets are not fully attached on all sides to the folder, which would allow papers to fall out when the folder is opened. The overall look of these black folders is fine, but handling it is another matter. My co-worker who uses these will have to be careful with them, since they're so thin they will crease easily. I will not buy these again for my office."
positive,Great!!: These ramp kit's made it easy for me to turn my spare 2x10's into a ramp for my lawn equipment. It comes with everything you need you just have to drill the holes.
positive,"PLATINUM BOUND - NO DOUBT ABOUT IT!!!!: This is the best CD I have ever listened to in some 20 years and Clay's voice is just wonderful!! It's refreshing to listen to a CD that is not full of ""sexual overtone and vulgar"" type lyrics. Clay Aiken certainly delivers on each and every song on the album. There is not one song on this CD that I skipped over. Billboard was right when they said that his CD is ""THE BEST POP ALBUM OF 2003"". The other critics who gave unfavorable reviews don't know what they are talking about. The more you listen to the entire CD, the better it is and after just listening a few times, you easily pick up the words and can sing along (can't say that with some of the other ""stuff"" that is out there)! I highly recommend that you buy this CD. I can't wait for other CD's by Clay Aiken. Way to go RCA and Clay Aiken!"
positive,"forget calphalon: I purchased calphalon just five years ago and have had enough. It is heavy and must be treated like china. This pan is much better. It cooks fast and is light weight. Best of all, it goes right into the dishwasher. Clean up is SO EASY!! Best purchased of pans I have ever made!!"
negative,"Works but not for security: I work in the automotive parts industry and must say this cap is not the best choice for anyone looking for a secure cap.Here is why: The cap is plastic, I had it installed on my 2008 Mustang and it was 'popped' (broke off) with a screwdriver in less than 3 seconds. The material is very cheap and you get what you pay for. It would be best to upgrade to a steel or metal cap for the best protection.However it did fit properly, and the locking mechanism is simple and easy to turn with no friction.If you are buying this to prevent people from stealing your gas then I would highly reconsider."
negative,"Cave people soap opera: I have never seen so much padding in a book, ever. It is worse than General Hospital that my mother watched for so many years. My feeling is that chapters were given to hired writers while Jean Auel was on vacation and the writers weren't very good. I think Jean's readers deserve something much better.Carol"
positive,"Yes, I liked it better than the original!!!: I really loved this movie. I watch many horror flicks and this is one of only three that actually freaked me out. I loved it. Yes, I liked it better than the original. I just had trouble with how everything was in the orginal. The new movie, The leading lady is actually worth something. She gets tough and kicks butt. The first movie, she is so air headed (not that I blame her) I just couldn't stand it. See this and you should see the first one but this one is the best!"
negative,"Nig-Nog?: One wishing to learn about racism in the gay community would do well by reading the collected novels of Mr. Hollinghurst. The graphically brutal rape of the white protagonist by the black cook near the end of The Swimming Pool Library is disturbing; but no less so than Hollinghurst's gratituous use of racial slurs and the stereotypical depiction of the ""black"" council clerk, Leo, in this contemporary ""masterpiece"".Not my cup of tea."
negative,"NO W2K SUPPORT: Wouldn't you think that intel (one of microsoft's key partners) would support their PRO hardware on a 2000 professional. Intel says ""no"" and they ""have no plans on supporting it in the future."" If you are going to buy a cam and plan on upgrading to the most current Windows release, make sure it has states explicit windows 2000 support. THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT HAVE IT!"
positive,"I enjoyed it: I've read some reviews where people have commented that Wil Smith's was awkward, bad acting, goofy, Big Bird etc and obviously everyone is entitled to their opnion (hence this site ) but I totally disagree. I feel that his acting skills improved in this movie. Also, the story was said to have too many implausible themes but most movies do. If I wanted to watch a movie based on a true story I would and if I did then maybe I would comment on what was and was not plausible. I think the movie was thought provoking, action filled, good acting and a nice story line. Kept me entertained.."
positive,"Why would you pay for a book that is in the public domain?: The Kindle format makes it easy to read. As I use this classic as a source of quotes, I find Kindle the best medium for reading it, and a PDF the best source for copying passages to include are references in other works. Amazon's price is so low that there is no question of value. Just getting it on my Kindle, in a format more useful than PDF, makes it worth the price. Also makes it not worth my while to look for free ebooks, which I'm sure are available. Just as Steve Jobs hit the magic price point with $1 per tune on the iPod, Amazon has found it here.I also recommend John Stuart Mill's autobiography. As an extraordinarily precocious child he knew his father's friend David Ricardo quite well, also Jeremy Bentham, Hume, and many other leading lights of the era. He knew of Adam Smith, and traces the personal relationships among this exceptional group of men."
positive,An Old Favorite in Ebook Form: I have lost track of how many times I have read this and now am reading and re-reading it as an ebook: GREAT
negative,"It deviated a lot from the book: Really, the title of my review is my review. The movie deviated a lot from the book and being a lover of Narnia, that was very disappointing to me. I hate what they did to Peter's character, I was annoyed by the added ""love interest"" and most importantly, Aslan was often left out. I love in the book the picture of faith and trust with Lucy having to decide whether to follow Aslan even when noone else believed her that he was there. That was not fully addressed in the movie - I suppose cut in leu of more battle scenes and false tension between Peter and Caspian. sigh. A very pretty movie though - I loved the river god - just sadly altered."
positive,"A colourful intelligent journey led by an enlightened guide.: The Spiritual Tourist's greatest strength is that it is accessible to believer and non-believer alike. Mick Brown is a first-rate story-teller, at times sceptical, but always respectful. A thoroughly enjoyable read which proves difficult to put down. Don't miss it."
positive,"PJ at theyre best: To me this is Pearl Jam's BEST album.......i have been a fan since the days of VS......you will love this album. It takes some time to get it, but it is a GREAT experience.....moody, atmospheric rock at its best!!!!!!!BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
negative,"Too Bad!: I really tried to enjoy this book. I am such a fan of her previous works and have re-read them several times. This book was TERRIBLE. I was so disappointed. I skipped half the book because I chose not to read all the re-hashing, and there are WAY too many sex scenes. Not sure I'll even bother with the next one. Hope she gets it together, and gets back in touch."
positive,"classic textbook: i bought this book as part of classic textbooks in semiotics studies. thin book, but basic ideas of semiotics, linguistics, and literature critique theories, by barthes."
negative,"Why don't I do something fun like beat my head against the wall for three hours?: A guy I work with read this book and it seemed like he was reading it for three years! Every day he sat there with his legs crossed sipping his tea and reading Great Expectations, spending about an hour on every page! What an aristocrat. It was brutal!Than I tried to read the book.I couldn't get past the first stage or the first part or whatever because it was so f*cking boring i thought my f*cking head was going to explode! NOTHING HAPPENED!That freak I work with didn't like it either.I'm just surprised he could read the whole thing without completely losing his mind."
negative,"Smells horrible - NOT like green tea at all: I've been searching high and low for a green-tea scented candle. I have found a lot of ""green tea/citrus"" and scents like that, but not just simply ""green tea"". So when I found this one, I bought it right away. None of the other reviews I read, even negative ones, seemed to mention Beanpod candles smelling gross. So I bought it. Candles cost too much as it is, but when I spend 20 bucks and then get something like this, I'm very disappointed.It did not smell like green tea in the slightest. The best I can come up with to describe the smell (which I could smell before even opening my package when it came in the mail), was some cross between AXE Body Spray and campground latrine disinfectant. It stung the nostrils. Just awful. I don't know how anyone could find this scent enjoyable, let alone claim that it smells anything like green tea."
negative,Waste of lots of time: This movie would be better if the heroine wasn't played as being psychotic all the time. Great props and costumes though.
positive,"Lots of Action: Typical cavalry versus Indian oater. Lots of action, which is what I ask from a Western."
positive,Tourmaline Ceramic Wet Dry Straightening Styler: I love this product. I have very thick and curly hair and since I've used this product I now have straight hair. Very easy to use and I haven't seen any damage to my hair. I am very happy to own one.
positive,Foundation and the complete series: Couldn't put any of the books in this series down. There is a college education in those books!
negative,"Dead brain cells.: Now Mick Jagger takes a swipe at the Presedent and conservatives in general with ""Sweet Neo-Con"". If anyone needs proof that drugs kill brain cells, they only need to look at all these Rock stars trying to be political scientists. The Rolling Stones should stick to writing songs about cheap sex, boos and partying. anything deeper than that could risk the loss of thier few remaining brain cells. Of course, the president and the conservatives needent be offended. Criticism from a bunch of old brain dead, stoner geezers should be taken as a compliment.after all, advice about character should come from one who actually has some. Womanizing stoners and boozers don't generally make the best judges on such matters. Advice to Mick: leave the political commentary to the professionals. Stick to the subjects you actually know: Getting laid and getting wasted."
negative,my opinion of Lord of the Flies: My opinion of the book is that i didnt like it as much and that it didnt pull me in to want to keep reading it.If you like action and like story lines where theres a fight for survival than you would probably enjoy Lord of the Flies.In the story you will see a group of kids that are stranded on a island and theres problems and many adventures that take place and if u want to find out more you'll have to read it for yourself.I wouldn't recommend this book because it wasn't exciting as much and i wanted to stop reading it becasue it was a waste of time for me.This is my opinion for my point of veiw of the book but its up tp you and hope you mgiht enjoy it or not.
negative,"difficult to read: After experiencing a loss recently, I was looking for books to help me during the difficult days that follow. I was looking for more personal experience or scientific info. All of the references to the bible in relation to pregnancy loss just did not make a connection with me. I am a spiritual person, but I just did not find this book very helpful. There are many other books that I found informative and comforting."
negative,"Atrocious quality: This kit is the single worst quality product of anything that I have ever bought tech related. The first gentle pull of the cable broke or jammed the retract mechanism so now I have a thin usb cable with a big piece of plastic in the middle. The plastic that houses the mechanism even splits apart just extending the cable. The connectors are convenient, as is the case, but the retract mechanism and casing are laughably bad. I have bought foreign made knockoffs of many items that had higher quality than these. I am normally very hard to irritate, but man these irritate me. This kit is NOT recommended."
positive,"Classic: I wore this dress to my senior prom and got nothing but compliments. It fit well and was VERY comfortable, it was MUCH cheaper than everyone else's dress, and -- unlike many styles these days -- wasn't too revealinig. I would absolutely reccomend it."
positive,"Office Space is a work of genius: I cried with laughter through the entire movie. I rolled on the floor. It is brilliant.The fact that I realized that they had just made a movie about my job should have caused me pain. But in a funny way, it helped.(My favourite line is the ""worst day of my life"" one at the hynotherapist. You'll see what I mean.)"
negative,"amazingly bad: considering all the hype this book is AMAZINGLY bad. Unoriginal and badly repped off prose. the only good parts are imitative and taken from other better authors. the bad parts are just bad: pooorly written and DULL. the female characters might as well not exist except as convenience for the overblown adolescent ego of the so-called hero.Another annoying thing: not even poalini claims to have written this book when he was fifteen. he STARTED IT when he was fiftenn--big deal, lots of people start lots of projects but it' when you FINISH trhat matters. this book was published when he was NINETEEN and anyone knows that means he finished it then. what a load of hype. stinks."
positive,"It really breaks loose!: When all hell breaks loose, it really breaks loose. The main character Greg is a positive role model and has it going on in his life. His business is booming, his friends are challenging and things are working well with the lady love in his life, enough so that he proposes.As in real life, what happens when things go well, all hell breaks loose and when you think it cannot get any worse, it does.This is a page turner and a nice debut novel. It is easy to complete in one setting. It was easy to predict what was going to happen in the end and the author took a few twist to arrive there. One downfall was that the prediction came to early in the book if you are a suspense reader, but it did not detract from the book. A little more developing of the characters will come as Ms. Spencer continues to write, and I expect we will receive more writings from this author."
negative,Over Acting and Excessive Violence Killed this Movie: Luc Besson has done some spectacular movies. This is not one of them. Milla's over-acting creates a character who is both annoying and difficult to believe. None of the central characters are easy to empathize with so one doesn't really care if they live or die. The violence seems unnecessary and gruesome. The script is choppy and the dialog is forced. Go watch The Professional instead.
negative,"popular music reaches all time low: just want to say that I am a musican and I am so sick of popular music ! pretty girls and pretty boys thats all they are !no talent I bet if they had to write and play their own music they would be lost! all you people that think she is so great should go and take some music lessons.get a little culture, buy somebody that has something positive to say.stop letting the radio and the gramys(thats a joke)decide who you listen to their are so many more talanted muscians out their, this stuff here is kiddy music GROW UP AMERICA!!!"
negative,"WORST BOOK EVER!!!!! DONT READ IT!!!!!: THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!! do not read it unless u have to! i had to read this book for english, and it made no sense and was absolutely terrible! i would never recommend this book to anyone!"
negative,"Stanley Kubrick's dead!: ""is free will more important than being good?"" this movie asks. ""No"" I replyed, ""if criminals have their freedom, then good people will lose their freedom."""
positive,"Just what i wanted: I ordered two hi def hdmi calbes and i got them :) Just a fantasic buy, i couldnt ask for more."
positive,"I finally read it!: I'm usually not much for science fiction but when I read Mysterious Island and it made mention of Captain Nemo, I decided it was finally time for me to read that classic I've heard about for over 50 years. I found the book interesting reading until it delved into the detailed sea creatures found all over the globe. (I skimmed through those sections because I've never been much into science or botany or biology.)I enjoyed reading the book but the residual effect for me is that now I am left wondering if something like that could actually have occurred in the mid 1800's."
negative,"Not what I expected: Sadly, this book spends more time being funny than it does offering sound advice and instructions for actual home maintenance. If I had bought it for entertainment purposes, it would have been great, but I got it to help me care for my home...something it doesn't do."
negative,"No extended editions - a waste of money: Unlike the first two potter films released in ""Ultimate Edition"" form, the second two versions do not include their extended editions. This might not be a legitimate complaint if these versions of the films didn't already exist. In the US, they are aired quite regularly on ABC Family, and are quite good.These extended editions of the film make the price point of the first two versions palatable, but their absence makes you wonder what exactly you're paying for with both this and the ultimate edition of PoA."
negative,"Not up to expectations: Many high schools cover this book in english classes, and though I hadn't read it in school, I've always been fond of Bradbury's short stories, so I figured I'd give it a read. I was fairly disappointed. It doesn't match his short fiction. I found the plot and characters dry and predictable. Maybe I just don't like carnies..."
positive,really great~!: With only four stars on the average review for this I had to add a review of my own! I give this five! I would give more but thats as high as we can get here at ama-zone eh>? This book is in many ways better than the book he's referring to by writing it! This is a good gift. Enjoy! PS: try the audio book format of the Four Agreements;theman has a beautiful soothing voice. But get this one in book format to sit under trees this summer and wonder...
positive,"Impossible: Hoping the best, expecting nothing, getting everything! As always with Bruce, it's not in and out music! Listen to the album, 3 to 4 times. I'm not in doubt...it's better than Born In The USA, ranking up there below The River....yet!I haven't succeeded in listening to ""You're missing"" without getting tears in my eyes. Hopefully I never will!It's really christmas!"
negative,"Watch the movie instead: The movie was pretty good. The book left me feeling violated, like I needed a hot shower with a strong soap. I don't blame Julia Child for the way she felt. Had I been Julia, I would have sued to keep my good name from being connected with this piece of work."
negative,disney classic: i hate this movie and the cricket gave me nightmares as a child but it is classic disney and i am making a collection forget letting your kids watch this
negative,"somewhat crappy: of course you can't expect the ps2 experience to translate to the psp. gameplay is entirely different, even with gamebreakers and such. would make a great way to pass time on long flights or rides if there were mini-games."
negative,"Design confuses some into burning kettle: I've had one house guest and one nanny place this kettle on my gas stove believing it's a standard kettle. The first time, I wrote Cuisinart a letter, and they graciously sent me a new kettle. Great customer service. The second time, I'm going with a less confusing design, the Capresso glass electric kettle for a couple extra bucks. It's not worth burning my house down ; ).This design looks just like Cusinart's other standard kettles. So if you have elderly parents, or people what are not familiar with recent developments in water boiling, you might want to consider a less confusing design. (p.s. the plastic base melts in seconds if it comes in contact with a heat source)."
negative,"Don't Bother: Bought this for my aging father-in-law, he couldn't read it, said it was too complicated, and he already knew how to play pinochle so this book was pretty much a bomb. Don't waste your money."
negative,"tedious reading: I minored in Spanish, was an exhange student in Madrid and embrace many aspects of Latin culture and devour lots and lots of Latino and Hispanic Lit. The idea for this book had so much potential, but the novel just doesn't work. It's hard to believe or get into the voice of the narrator, Claire, an adult young woman character because she comes off girlish, shallow, and wholly boring, and the Latina characters were just too superficially written to retain my interest and were unbelievable because they lacked depth and human oddities and characteristics that make characters in literature so memorable. The women either come off too saintly to believe or stereotypical. The concept for the novel was great, but the writer fails because this novel doesn't have ironies, interesting drama, complex personality contradictions within the characters, a fresh or provocative writing style, believable epiphanies, or any treats the reader can take away with her/him."
negative,"Good picture, overall quality poor: I have had this DVD player for 15 Months. About 3 MOnths ago, it started to take to skipping. It does not happen on all DVDs, but most. Usually it takes about 30-40 Minutes, and then you have to turn the playe off and on to get it to stop if you are lucky. Also, it sometimes does not read DVDs in the tray. Pretty poor in my opinion.That being said, the one positive I will give it is that the Picture is really nice. I don't know that I would buy a Toshiba DVD player again."
negative,"The worst of Grisham's: I've read almost all of Grisham's series. All of them are riveting and page turner. But, this book took me six month to finish. For those six-month reading, I could not help think that ""is this real Grisham's???"" I'm so disappointed."
negative,"Give It Up King!!!: Once again in Dreamcatcher King has delivered the literary equivalent of 5 pounds of horse manure in a ten pound bag. I used to love reading King but his last 5 books have proven to be a great disappointment. He ought to give some of his royalties from this book to the Estate of Richard Laymon from whom he ""borrowed"" the evil aliens from. Does King even have an editor thsese days? Belive it or not King we aren't all interested in evry thought that pops into your head. [...].I give this book the big ""Thumbs Down"""
positive,"Beautifully Crafted Novel: ""Of Mice and Men"" is a beautifully crafted short novel concerning the relationship between two migrant workers from the 1930s. The first character, Lennie, has quite severe learning difficulties and relies heavily on his friend George. Lennie is very strong and this in itself gets him into all sorts of problems. George has to come to Lennie's aid on a regular basis as a result of him getting into trouble through misinterpretations of his actions and a naviety of his own strength.Genuinely moving, the reader cannot fail to build up a great empathy with the lead characters; less so with the other figures that appear in the book- despite each one having their own set of problems.Steinbeck does a tremendous job of conveying his story to the reader, and it would be a person with a heart made of stone that would not be moved by the story's conclusion.An excellent read for older children and adults of all ages. Highly recommended."
positive,One of my favorite movies!: Glad to update from VHS to DVD so I can watch one of the best movies and sing great songs anytime I want!
positive,Read it or there and back again: Yes I just had to read the Hobbit again! It was just as wonderful as when I read it while in my youth. You just have to soak up the wonderful tale that Tolkien came up with and hope the movie does it justice.
negative,Asvab for Dummies: It was a good book but the pages was yellow and the book was old. It should of said ok book instead of good book. But I love the book and it breaks down the questions.
positive,"A Must Read!: Enter one very unlikely hero who is trying to call national attention to the scourge. Randy Grim was young, hip, but crippled by panic attacks and phobias (of public places, parties, elevators, driving). After rescuing his first street dog, Bonnie, he couldn't look away. ""How can I?"" he asks. ""Each one says, `Don't leave me here.'"" And so the man who must pop Xanax to walk through an airport refuses to leave a starving, terror-stricken German Shepherd on a dark, icy and stormy East St. Louis street, even when an threatening tenement resident has him on the business end of a gun.Journalist Melinda Roth puts a human, and animal, face on an ignored tragedy playing out in our cities. She gives us beautifully wrought, but too few, scenes of redemption."
positive,Fell of my bed laughing!: This was the first Terry Pratchett novel I read. Now I have 10 others. This book was funny in so many ways. One of my favorite things is Mr. Pratchett's use of footnotes. The one about Bloody Stupid Johnson is the best! I highly recommend the whole Discworld series to every reader.
positive,"Very Satisfied!!: I tried my heart moniter as soon as it arrived and it worked very well.I've had it nearly a month and use it several times a week and it works great.The monitor is overall pretty decent for it's price.I love the ""out of range"" alarm feature!I recommend this product to anyone who is a beginner in monitoring their heart rate during excersize.It is very easy to program and use."
positive,"The Parables Review: As a Precepts on Precepts student doing a 23 lesson study on Matthew, I thought this would be a good book to help understand Jesus' parables better. Kay Aurthur advocates letting scripture interpret scripture. The author of ""The Parables"" did a nice job, but I guess I was looking for more indepth analysis of the various parables. I would recommend this book; it is an easy read and does give a lot of information about the parables. Maybe if I were to read it a second time I'm sure I would get more out of the book. It's like reading the bible, you are always discovering a truth that you did not see before."
positive,"As Expected From Plano: I own several Plano cases and was not disappointed with this latest 1404 case. They are high quality with great lockable latches. The two layers of foam in this case makes it very versatile. Only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because it would be nice if there was foam on the inside edges. If you have really heavy items in it, they slide to the bottom when you pick the case up. It would be nice to have foam on the bottom edges to protect those items when they move. Lighter items don't move but a fully loaded pistol or, in my case, 33 round Glock mags fully loaded tend to move. Other than that, great case for the money and well worth it."
positive,"Not very dirty dancing, but a great film.: I had heard of this film but hadn't seen it until last year. And it has to be one, if not, my all time favourite film.Baby (Jennifer Grey) is on vacation with her family. She is a typical Plain Jane, who stumbles upon the staff's area where they are dancing raunchily. Then along comes one of the dancers Johnny (Patrick Swayze). He doesn't like her, and when he has to teach her to dance with him he is not happy. But as the spend time together he sees that she is not that bad.This has some really good music, such as `I've had the time of my life', playing as the final dance sequence plays out.A dazzling film with the added bonus of Patrick Swayze being really cute and having a really good body!"
negative,"Poor Tracking: As some have stated, this VCR produces noticable jittery effects on screen during playback and has done so from day 1. I would not recommend it to anyone, and I have lost faith in Sony QC."
negative,"Doesn't FIT!: DOES NOT FIT! Product is branded with the GARMIN logo. And further states for use on GPSMAP 396 (our model). As another review states...""The contacts are correctly placed but the rubber type product that is meant for a press fit into the gps is too small in diameter and the cord immediately falls out.""Before ordering, I visited the GARMIN WEBSITE to grab the SPECIFIC PRODUCT NUMBER FOR THE CORD - to make SURE this was the right cord on the Amazon site...and IT DID MATCH.You're forced to cut the plastic packaging to get it out to try it. I'm going to attempt sending it back..."
negative,"""I Wish"".....I never bought this album: This is a very disappointing release. I'm sure R. Kelly worked hard on this release, but the lack of content of the songs written on this album is disturbing. The production, while clear, is uninspiring. ""I Wish"" is the only gem on this album.This effort is reminisent of the 1994 album 12 Play. However, 12 Play (94') release is loaded with heavy bass and catchy tunes. TP-2.com is an album for the ""fans"". Unfortunately, fans are willing to accept anything these day. After the 1998 release ""R"", Kelly showed everyone that he is a skilled songwritter and producer. TP-2.com leaves you with one question, what happened between to Kelly?"
positive,"I'll Get on that Bandwagon Also!!: Bought this the week it was released in 1982. Three words: ""WORE IT OUT!!!!!"". Please, Please, again I say PLEASE release it again on CD!!!!"
negative,"only read this is if you really really like short stories: I picked up this book after reading John Berdendt's book on Venice and Jane Turner Rylands' book paled in comparison. She captured some colorful characters in her book, the writing is lively, but that's all she does, captures the characters. I realize the short stories are short stories but these character snapshots feel incomplete - more like a bit of poetry."
positive,"Soundtrack for sly lovers: Ah Arab Strap, given the title of miserable (...)from Scotland but that rather misses the point. They've lyrics that are very dry and cutting which can make you laugh out loud. And on this album they seem to sound a little happier ( Come Round and Love Me, Dream Sequence ) although it does have some sad moments ( Chat in Amsterdam, Winter 2003 ). But in general it sounds a lot more brighter, chirpier as if they've got a new spring in their step from a new relationship. And even on the topical There Is No Ending you still feel that while the world may be a big pile of (...) outside, everything else is alright. Which in a funny way is quite comforting and reassuring. If you can take Aidan Moffat's voyeurist-love-detective style of singing ( never short of an innuendo somewhere ) then this album is for you. Enjoy"
negative,"Hain White Cheddar Popped Corn Mini Cakes: These are pretty bad. I had tried the mild cheddar variety and liked those quite a bit, so I bought 12 packs of each. I opened a bag of the white cheddar and was amazed at how unpleasant they tasted (didn't taste white cheddar) - now I'm stuck with 11 bags! I'll sell them to you half price!!"
positive,"You are what you pretend to be: I generally get around to reading this book once a year. I also tend to buy it once a year as I seem to hand it out like a Jehovas Witness with a copy of WatchTower.All in all, it's not the biggest waste of my money. This is perhaps the finest literature penned in English. Read it. You will laugh when you really think you should be crying."
positive,"Hot Coffee: This is the 4th mugwarmer that I have bought - still using the other 3 in different places. Had a hard time trying to find one in the stores, so I was thankful to find one on Amazon.com. I selected this one because it was a good price and seemed more substantial than the others. So far it works great - no complaints at all. My other mugwarmers are white. I like the black color because it seems to blend better with my nice wooden office desk. I would recommend it!"
negative,"Pathetic Design: I've had the Mr. Coffee 4-cup switch (?) coffee maker for about a month, using it once or twice daily. The spring-loaded valve that enables ""Stop-n-Pour"" has fallen out 6 times. The plastic O-ring on the valve is beginning to break down. The pot is very difficult to put into or take out of the unit, requiring two hands. The pot leaks coffee onto the counter during the first pour, no matter how it is done. When the pot is taken out of the unit, coffee drips onto the heater plate, resulting in a scorched-coffee smell. It's hard to imagine how such a design failure made it into production. At $19.99, this is overpriced by about $19.98. A terrible piece of kitchen equipment."
positive,"Hands down one of the funniest ever: This move is hilarious, full of great scenes, etc etc. This is a must see movie."
negative,"Slow: Disk in and out are slow than my old Poineer. USB only support real USD driver, not my mp3 or hard disk. Support mp4? no! It should say, some of the mp4 format, NOT all mp4.Not worth the money."
positive,"Deal with anger?: If you deal with ANGER in your life, and who doesn't, this workbook (self-directed study on anger) is for YOU!There are many helpful hints and thoughts, and although they are given in the context of Christianity, I believe almost anyone can benefit.For those on a 12-step program, you will not believe how closely anger and addiction are related. Do yourself a favor and get (and read) this book!"
positive,"Good book if you look into it.: The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it. It is true that it's language can be hard to read and understand at times, but that does not make it uninteresting. The main story, may not be considered exciting, but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book. Several faults are pointed to in this ""perfect"" Puritain town in which the story takes place. The book uses good elements like foreshadowing, foil characters, and a lot symbolism. A main point of the book is Hester's admiting her guilt as compared to her ""lover's"" hiding his guilt. I'm not going to tell you who she had the affair with, but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter. The book may not be as exciting as some, but don't let this keep you from reading it, because it really is good."
negative,"WORST BOOK I EVER READ!: This had to be the most boring book I have read in my entire life! We had to read it for school, and a majority of the class ended up just reading the cliff's notes. I do not recommend this book to anyone, except to this one pig-like girl I know. Anyway, I never want to see this book ever again. I'm going to have nightmares about it! A warning to all: Never read this book unless you have to!"
positive,"Very Good Bible for back pocket: This bible is compact enough to comfortably fit in the back pocket of my blue jeans. The book looks a bit thick but once in the pocket, you'll find that it carries well and is one of the best translations available today."
positive,"3 years later, it's still chugging along perfectly...: I noticed a few reviews complaining about their extension cords breaking down after just few months of usage, so I decided to let you all know that after nearly THREE years of use, mine works just as good as it did on day 1. It was cheap, does what it's supposed to, and hasn't failed me yet. Buy with confidence!"
positive,Sand in the Wind: See my last review for the 'Gear' books. They all read the same....GREAT!! Any new book based on the same subject matter would be in my library. Pronto!
positive,"Nice Album from West Coast!: Good Production,With tons of most loved West Coast Gangsta Rapper support,Snoop Dogg, DPG, RBX, Ras Kass, Kokane, Suga Free Ice Cube....etcStrong West Coast Line up!!!All songs is very good!One of the album that you should purchase for you west coast collections!"
positive,"Steinbeck Masterpiece: My 17 year old needed a book for an English report. I wanted to introduce him to one of my all-time favorite authors, but at the same time not overwhelm him the volumn of ""East of Eden"" or ""Grapes of Wrath"", etc. This is a kid who is going to be an engineer and doesn't ""believe reading is all that important"". After all, it is not Science!I, of course, re-read it still another time before handing it to him. He was delighted at the sight of such a thin book (""I can read this in two nights""). He had to admit after reading it, that his teacher and I were correct in our assessment of Steinbeck. His writings are timeless."
positive,Great book. Ready many times over.: I wish I could just rate the book w/out writing a review! I'm not an author. I don't have a way with words!
negative,"Chromatic aberration up the wazoo: Simple. It was an open-and-shut case. I got it out, tried it for a few seconds. Its chromatic aberration made my head spin. I shoved it back immediately and sent it back.By the way, there are too many pockets that may retain water. I wouldn't call this water-resistant, let alone waterproof.This thing sure made it easy for me to decide.I ordered a 10 x 20 Zeiss Conquest. Obviously, the two belong to two different categories, but the image quality of the Zeiss makes this Nikon's lack of image quality look like a 25 toy from the vending machine."
positive,What's Knot to like?: Great little knot guide! Good illustrations and directions are included. Nice small pocket size or put it in your workshop...
negative,"Count Grishnak pales in comparison to Euronymous: Count Grishnak, aka Varg Vikernes should never get credit for any of this music solely for the reason that he murdered the originator of black metal, Euronymous from Mayhem. The music is not too bad, but Grishnak deserves no attention for his deeds."
positive,"3 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Why Bertolucci thought it was a good idea to cut away from Brando and Schneider in order to focus on the latter's boring boyfriend I'll never know, but when Last Tango in Paris focuses on the main couple (and Brando in particular) it's a powerful, if somewhat formless, film that is no less candid and raw than it was 30 years ago."
positive,Science lovers special!: Sheer adventure narrative for the aquatic zoology and oceanography nerd. Captain Nemo the prototype for the mad at mankind genius villain; bad yet sympathy-deserving.Actually challenging reading: many 50 science terms.
positive,"GREAT READING!: The author did a good job at capturing the reader's attention even though the story did begin to span at various points. The going back and forth trying to decide whether or not to stay or leave her husband, got kind of tiring and very boring. However, the author did enlist a surprise twist at the end of the story. Ms. Lawson may well be on her way to adding a little mystery or intrigue into her storylines. I wonder how the author would rate as a mystery novelist."
positive,"A Cd that you can listen to all the way through many times: This CD is so fantastic. Great songs for everyone! My favorite 'The Way"" also loved ""Touch"" (sounds like Marc Antony),and ""Perfect Day"" (sounds like the Beatles). I also really liked ""When You say You Loved Me"", very catchy."
negative,"more scenery than i cared for: I bought this based on a recommendation from church. Donny and Maria sing superbly, but my objections deal with the costumes. The skin-tight provocative dancers was totally unnecessary for a supposedly family-friendly version. And Joan Collin's outfit as Potiphar's wife was overboard as well. My boys turned there heads when watching it with me. I can not recommend this to others."
positive,"We liked this book a lot: This book is a solid book on how to work the bars. We are currently field-testing the results and will let you know exactly what we find when we have covered everything in it. But even so, after reading it we liked it a lot. More soon."
positive,"an introduction to a new way of thinking...: What Jeff Pugh has accomplished with this work is nothing short of amazing. While the faiths of the world battle over interpretations and power structures, Christianity finds a new voice for itself that emerges from its own past. In The Matrix of Faith, Pugh examines the issue of postmodernity and takes uses a series of voices from Martin Luther to Anselm of Canterbury to Dietrich Bonhoeffer and challenges contemporary Christians to find a new way of understanding the narratives of their faith. An important work for any young scholar seeking an entrance into the world of postmodern theology or any member of the Christian community seeking a new way of living their faith."
positive,"Excellent modern day horror film: Realistic 1960's horror film filled with great performances by an ensemble cast. I felt this was one of Roman Polanski's best directed films. Well written script leaves the viewer wondering until the final few minutes whether or not the central character is truly a victim or simply paranoid. Dialogue closely follows Ira Levin's novel. Unfortunately, younger viewers used to special effects or gore may be put off or bored by the lack of both. Horror and tension is created instead with dialogue and the viewer's imagination."
negative,"Left me cold: Okay, I'll admit it was sort of scary, but it got on my nerves how completely unlikeable the characters were. When one of the humans fell prey, I thought 'so what'...when one of the vampires was being high and mighty, I thought 'whatever'. Having the vampires turn into a grotesque, ugly beast is orginal, but actually rather distasteful. It did have a lot of surprise twists to the plot, which saved it from being awful, but I won't read it again, and I won't keep the book. My biggest complaint is that no one could resist the draw of vampirism...what absolutely no one? Come on."
negative,"100 pages of interesting in a 500 page book: Did you know that the writers/performers worked all night on Tuesdays? Or that Lorne Michaels was a dysfunctional father figure? Well you'll be reminded about every fifth page of this yawner. Sure there's some interesting gossip and sniping, but save yourself some time and get the cliff notes because this is about 100 pages of interesting in a 500 page book."
negative,This is not good.: I bought this dvd to watch and hopefully get more information. I bought a guide book also. Frommer's 2012 guide book. It is very good.This is the worst dvd I have watched in a very long time. The music is 70's porn star creepy. The narrator has the worst bad jokes and dumb sayings through out this dvd.What a waste of money.
positive,"More Mummies, Please: Now that's entertainment, everything you want in an action movie. And what about that next movie, hollywood guys? No, the Scorpion King doesn't count - I want to know what Rick and Evie tackle after the Mummy Returns. By the way, you can double your pleasure from this film (and the second movie) with your family by adding the nifty A&E Egypt double-dvd - Mummies And The Wonders of Ancient Egypt. It's very inexpensive and the episodes are fabulous-looking on DVD; it's not a 400-level Egyptology class, but hey, you're American consumers like me, right?"
negative,"Kindle version - lost formatting: Once again, the free kindle version is a disappointment. Both the formatting and the illustrations have been lost. In my opinion, the charm of a book like this is often in the accompanying illustrations. It would be better to buy a complete version than download this one."
positive,"Very good solo debut from the former Soundgarden frontman: On Euphoria Morning, Chris Cornell shows us the vocal sylings he's hinted at, but never had the chance to fully explore as the lead singer for the now-defunct Soundgarden. His debut solo effort is a great one - filled with lilting melodies, unique chord arrangements, and a few radio-worthy tunes to make this a commercial as well as a critical success. Standouts include 'Can't Change Me', 'Preaching the End of the World', and 'Pillow of Your Bones'. The album gets a bit weak towards the middle (as most seem to), but comes to a strong finish with 'Pillow' having you sing along and the eerie 'Steel Rain', which you can envision Chris singing somewhere in a dark, desolate place. If the album were a bit more consistent throughout, and his earlier hit, 'Sunshower' were included, I'd give it 5 stars. But again, it is a solid effort as it stands, and I'm looking forward to seeing him in Philly at the Tower Theater!--Sean"
negative,"Yeesch: I'm convinced that this is the worst movie ever made. I rented it because it sounded like it might have been remotely interesting but it wasn't even that. The story was godawful, the acting was worse and the effects were comical. So instead of purchasing this film, do yourself a favor. Take the money you were going to spend on the tape, buy a torch and a metal hanger, heat the hanger with the torch and beat yourself senseless. It would be infinately more enjoyable than watching this movie."
negative,"I still have not received my purchase.: I ordered Foundation and Earth on July 28, 2010. I received the wrong book (Foundation and Empire) on August 6, 2010 and immediately notified the sender who said they would ship a replacement out immediately. It is now August 29, 2010 and I have still not received the book I ordered. I understand the book I ordered was ridiculously inexpensive, but that doesn't justify terrible service. If you could get the wrong book to me within a week, I don't understand why the correct order couldn't have been here within a week, though since you made the mistake I believe it should have been expedited. Very disappointed and still awaiting the book. Contacted seller a week ago and they said they could confirm it has been dispatched, but I still have not received it."
positive,"Blue Gill fever: Large Bluegills are one of the hardest little fish to catch because they are wary like deer. Fooling a bluegill with fly tackle is as much fun as catching a giant bass because of the fight they give, and this is why this book is so good. It breaks down the fishing element into steps that lead you to the big ones, and teaches you how to find the right places to fish for them. This is a Great Book!"
positive,"Best Footbag my son has ever used...: I picked this ""SandMaster Footbag"" because of all the good reviews I read on it. It was a surprise gift for my 17 year old son at Christmas. He was delighted with it...couldn't wait to show the fellows! He had been used to playing with 'lighter' hackey sacks (that's what they call them in Arkansas). After he played with it for awhile, he said there was no going back to the lighter (less in weight) ones. He's become very good with it. My only complaint was that I did not have a choice in color, and they sent us a light tan and white one. Boys play outside. My son would highly recommend the ""Sandmaster Footbag""."
positive,"Strange and Beautiful: As a lapsed Catholic and a searching person for the meaning of organized religion in my life, I found this book rich with bursts of insight. The various personalities in religion; aspects of life within the Benedictine church; and a variety of small, beautiful critical thinking essays on the meanings of icons and values are some of the topics Norris explores in her chapters.Overall, they are thought-provoking and reveal a person who is more than a visitor to the ways of the Benedictine.I only gave four stars, since I found her writing style a bit distracting and the organization of the book not exactly conducive to easy reading. It's true that each chapter is a handful, but the editor might have done Norris a favor by facilitating the outline of the book."
positive,"LoL Comedy: Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim was an amazing novel written by David Sedaris. I enjoyed reading this book from cover to cover. The humor was never ending. He took real life stories and told them bluntly with a humor that not many authors can match. The randomness of the novel was what made the novel unique. He talked about the little things in life rather than the big. He told about his family relationships, finding his sexuality, and growing up. The continuous culture shock that is David Sedaris's life was intriguing and hilarious. If you like roll on the floor comedy you will love Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim by David Sedaris.By: Kassie Forman"
positive,"soft and very nice: i love these diapers, also they are at a great price. they leak at night sometimes if the baby pees tons of times, which is very normal."
positive,Excellent Animated Film: I was fortunate to have worked on this film as an animator and a key assistant and I am very happy to see all the good reviews for this film. It was a joy to make and a highlight of my animation career. Pick up a copy at the WB shop listed below... it will be worth it!
negative,"Rocket worth a quarter - Pay $9: Mini Saturn V RocketThe product picture is much better than the reality. This is a flexible rubber toy worthy to be included in the 25 cent clearance barrel at any 99Cent store. If you are happy paying $2.49 for a toy covered with sticky glue from pealed off price tags, go for it. Just be aware that the shipping on this itty-bitty rocket is going to be $6.55 for a grand total of $9.04. I foolishly bought this mixed into a much larger order and didn't notice the shipping cost. Buyer beware."
positive,"Excellent comedy of errors: A man with a large family has just died, so the whole brood gathers at his home for the funeral. Among them: A son who feels inferior to his talented brother, a niece whose boyfriend was accidentally given a hallucinogenic drug, a lovelorn suitor, a hypochondriac, and a dwarf who has some very special photos of the deceased.This hysterical Britcom is everything you could hope for - a superbly witty script, naturally funny actors who play deadpan with ease, and a director who knows how to do funny. The large ensemble cast features Matthew Macfadyen and Kris Marshall and everyone is outstanding.This look at craziness behind a funeral's proper faade kept me giggling from start to finish. Highly recommended."
positive,"amazing: This is an incredibly mature record from a man that used to stab himself with pencils in concert. He displays his maturity though calm music, meaningful lyrics, and 3 monologues. The monologues are ""No Sh*#t"", ""Afraid to Get Close"", and ""She Called Me Daddy"". Iggy Pop's music has always showed great emotion, whether it is anger, desperation, or sadness, there's plenty of it here. ""Avenue B"" is probably my favorite song on here. ""Motorcycle"" and ""Corruption"" are other notable tracks. This probably isn't Iggy's best of the 90's (American Caesar is pretty good...) but it's still up there as one of the best albums he has ever recorded."
negative,"Shelters of Padding: Was she paid by the word? If so, she earned her money. Every sentence in this looong, slow and dreary novel was repeated, rehashed, resaid and reiterated numerous times. The book could (and should) have been a quarter of the length it is. The dialogue is unbelieveable at best, the psychological insights hilariously anachronistic. The only genuine feeling is when cave drawings are described. The sex scenes obligatory every 75 pages are a howl and the fashions are to die for. Read it if you must, but Jean Auel has lost the touch and produced a really bad, padded monstrosity of a wooly mannoth."
negative,"A Children's Book: I found this book to be too simple. Perhaps children would like it (I myself love animals), but it wasn't thought-provoking enough.The characters' names somehow bothered/annoyed me. I liked the idea of cats running about in clans, but I simply did not like their society, their family itself.Erin Hunter has a tendency to include far too many characters. The first Warriors book I picked up had an entire list of characters. A sort of dramatis personae (or felidae). Cats upon cats. Is it really so necessary to throw in so many characters?"
negative,"Chicken Little gets a job as a financial advisor!: This is ""Chicken Little gets a job as a fiancial advisor."" Lots of what-if, what-if, what-if...but no answers beyond save more money and reduce your expenses in retirement. This book takes you on a never ending quest to find the number...but the only consistent message is that no matter how much you manage to save or think you need...it will not be enough.In the last paragraph Eisenberg says ""Better to invest this valuable energy, and use that time, to come to terms with who you are, or, if it better pleases you, to make more money."" I suggest you take his advice. If you've read more than 3 or 4 of these reviews then you have already wasted too much time on this book.Why doesn't Amazon have a ""zero star"" option?"
positive,"Short quick and accurate: The short, 30 page, booklet about Fred Harvey and his empire in the late 1800's, is a good summation of the impact he had on the hospitality industry, specifically, eating establishments."
positive,"good reading: Rather intresting, but mostly thin on the story side, this book runs with the luftwafe, as it stormed europe, with detailed info. Would have been better, if explained some about the proffession of air war before telling us the numbers. you see, life isnt just numbers. still, fun reading."
negative,"made by the CIA: IMDB.com didn't think my comment on this film was worth posting, but I will try here and hope Amazon.com doesn't have high requirements :)I have never seen this film, but the New York Times has reported on the discovery that this film, along with the 1950's version of ""1984"", was created by the CIA. Created may be too strong a word however. If I remember the report correctly, the CIA funded both of these projects while demanding some alterations be done. The fact that the pigs in this movie do not stand alongside the humans at the end, like in the book, is due directly to the CIA's influence.The report was on the new book ""The Cultural Cold War"", which can also be found at Amazon.com (grin grin). So for more details, check out that book.1 star for being manipulated by the CIA :)"
negative,"Pathetic!: I read 2 books a week, less when I have school, but this book is pathetic. Absolutely the worst I've ever encountered. Moronic characters and horrible. Skip it!"
positive,"Not For Everyone,But Right For Me.: Indeed,Peter Gabriel is not the sort of artist who makes light pop music,but once you understand where his vision is coming from,you know it some of the most rewarding music you have ever heard. Like David Byrne,he seems to be spouting incomprehensible nonsense,but it is the ""nonsense"" of a genius that you have to pay attention to to understand. Of course his first solo records after Genesis were thick and moody, but those same songs performed live (Plays Live,of course) are nothing short of thrilling, like early U-2. U-2,before the self-absorbed pretension set in. Peter Gabriel's studio and live records (yes,at first they were RECORDS-LP's-they go back that far!) compliment one another,get them both to feel the full experience."
negative,"A disappointing work by Holt: I have forced myself to finish this book. There is no connection between ""the Chinese way"" and the heroine. Everything is throughly stereotypical. If you want something exotic, look elsewhere. This book is a bore."
negative,"Didn't work: I received this item as a gift because I like crafts. I was quite excited about trying some of the included projects. I tried my hardest to get this to work and I could achieve nothing more than torn paper. I observed that there is a metal tip that comes out if you hold the pen straight up and down, but it retracts as soon as it hits a hard surface. I tried the replacement tip and had the same problem with it as well. I tried going very very slowly, tried with a lot of pressure, very little pressure, in between pressure. I tried everything, and the only thing happening was the paper being ripped by the plastic tip if I pressed hard enough.I am unsure if I received a defective unit or whether the product works this way for everyone. I am going to return it and try a replacement, but am worried I may be in for more of the same."
negative,not that good. grossly over-rated.: i mean it wasnt that good sounds not unlike anything we havent heard before. whats the big deal. I guess if your a critic you have to say its good because you have to be politicaly correct. I mean gosh darn she's black and shes singing hip hop.Who would dare go against that right?
negative,"Save your money: Although this book has some decent pictures the writing and analysis is below average. Writer appears more interested in underwater photography. His coverage of spearguns borders on the flimsy. He appears to have little actual experience in this area. Book is only 133 pages. 1. I saw no pictures of author with fish. 2. Written in third party format. Appears to be commercial diver or instructor. 3. Speargun coverage lightweight, knowledge of powerheads insufficient. Nothing on shark defense. 4. Seems to condone not using safeties on guns. 5. Does not use own equipment in book but refers to borrowed spearguns, etc.. 6. Appears to own little or none of his own spearing equipment. Written from the reporter, photographer point of view. I recommend looking elsewhere."
positive,"Heavy Metal: This is a great set of 3 videos. A ton of interviews and videos from Lita Ford, Bang Tango, Axl Rose, L.A. Guns, Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, Skid Row, Poison, Cinderella, Faster Pussycat, Mike Monroe, Winger, Femme Fatale, W.A.S.P. and many more."
positive,"Neat product - much cheaper than buying new!: Hadn't ever used a product like this, and it was pretty easy. It wasn't completely clean like the pkg advertises, but it does warn to fill over hard countertop... Only a small drip - all in all a good product, and the ink looks just the same as the original cartridges. I'd recommend it."
negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This is the worst printer in the world. it scans ok but it fails to do the basic task required of a printer - it won't PRINT!!!!!The paper feed is terrible, and don't buy the crap about ""if you buy HP paper it works fine"" it DOES NOT, i have continually tried to use HP photo paper (remember this is supposed to be wonderful at printing photos) it will not grab it, HP need to recall all of these printers in my opinion, the only thing this printer is good for is flying out of my window."
positive,"Puffy Wall Art: I am quite pleased with this wall art that coordinates with the bubbles and fish bedding set. The wall art is puffy (think stuffed toy) with a small white ribbon on the top of each piece for hanging. All pieces are machine washable. The size of the fish range from 8 1/2 - 10 inches from tip to tail. The bubbles are about 3 - 3 1/2 inches wide and 7 1/2 inches long. I do wish, however, that there were more color options than just green, blue and orange."
negative,"Would be Nice to use it first: I have had this product for about 4-5 weeks now and I have yet to get it to work. I contacted Talismoon and I'm still waiting for a driver for my vista machine. On the product page it says nothing about this product not working with Vista any where. So until I can use the product it will just sit on my desk tell I get some answers. I have to say that the only guy that helped me was one of the tech guys he contacted the product producer and asked for a driver for me, they replied they didn't make one so I'm screwed tell they make one. But for the product I have to say if you plan to market a device, product, merchandise make sure it works for what its supposed to work for. As far as using Amazon all was good I have never had a problem with Amazon they are one of the best in the Internet marketplace."
negative,Not that great of a learning guide: This is more like example code than what I'd expect out of a textbook. I would recommend another book instead.
negative,more like my spots still visible: Dont waste your money i have a purplish scar on my forehead from skin cancer this stuff wipes right off and does not conceal even a pimple ! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative,"Just an attempt to cash in on the '96 trajedy.: Everything that needs to be said was said in ""Into Thin Air"" and ""The Climb."""
negative,"No spanish audio nor subtitles for 2 & 3: Good fun movies and nice compilation but... Spiderman 2 and 3 do not offer any audio or subtitles in spanish. If like myself you need them, then don't buy this version. Look for each one individually for a version that has at least subtitles."
negative,"Perhaps the worst book that I have ever read: To call this book bad would be an understatement, it goes beyond bad, it's outright terrible!! I can't believe that this book was even published. It was written by a teenager and it shows, It reads more like a high school project, something he had to do for an creative writing class. I'm not going to go into great detail why this book is so bad, it just is."
negative,"""The Silence of the Dummies"": This is overall a real hoot! Anthony Hopkins is superb! ""Fats"" the dummy steals lots of the scenes.The question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the Dummy or Ann Margarett trying to act!Burgess Meredith is great as the manager. One point of interest is the horrible score by Jerry Goldsmith. He throws in a great harmonica riff when we see ""Fats"", but during some of the more ""romantic "" scenes the music is so cloying it would make Yanni blush.Don,t miss the extras where they talk with the real ""vent"" that worked with them on the movie.If you like movies that are a bit ""outside"" this is a must have for any collection.Pete Cavano"
positive,"I love this album: I can listen to this over and over for hours. I've always been into cheesy pop stuff (I probably have the biggest Debbie Gibson collection of anyone (well, anyone who would admit it)). So getting into Mandy Moore wasn't too big a stretch. I actually saw the 2 of them together at a radio station promo back in 99. They both sang to pre-recorded tracks, but it was still cool.Anyway - this album is way cool. You'd have to be a freak to be disappointed. All great songs, all great arrangements. It isn't often you get to hear vibes in pop music today."
positive,"Super Ecstatic Reader!!!™: I loved reading Eragon!!! it has a great introduction to the amazing series! it leads to a very exciring ad suspenseful series! just becuase of a Dragon, eragon gets a HUGE burden. the fate of alagasia rests on his shoulders™Copyright Super Ecstatic Reader!!"
positive,"Great Glider: We needed to replace a wooden glider that we had in front of our house and after looking around and not really finding what we were looking for our son suggested we check Amazon.com. We chose this one because we felt it would last for a long time and the size was right. When we received it we put it together and it was very easy to assemble. The movement of the glider is smooth. The color is a little blah, but we added a couple of colorful pillows and have received many compliments on it. The price is great and we are very happy with our purchase!"
positive,A Charlie Brown Christmas Is Very Good!: Like other reviewers I also grew up watching A Charlie Brown Christmas when CBS showed it every December and I liked every minute of it including the heartwarming speech by Linus about the true meaning of Christmas and I think this is a great Christmas cartoon but I was disappointed with the extra feature cartoon It's Christmas Time Again Charlie Brown because It was very uneven and choppy!
negative,"Not the Established Characters.: The first two ""Anne of Green Gables"" movies were terrific. Interesting characters carried you to a nicer place. This movie has more turmoil and disputes, rather than charming predicaments. Did not continue the characters of Green Gables for me.This movie should have been made with new actors, rather than the Green Gables cast, so that fans would not expect the charm of Avonlea to continue; which it does not here. However, if you have not seen the first two Anne movies, this film may be fine for you, and better than other things on TV today. I do recommend ""Road to Avonlea"", seasons 1-6."
positive,"great fun: Only two little issues with this toy.1. You are gonna want more balls. seriously... order them when you order this product. The balls that come with it are simply not enough. We got a hundred more for a really good price and it made all the difference.2. The basket ball hoop came right off in my sons hands. It wasn't sewn on very well to begin with I guess.Other than that, the seams are holding up well and my two year old loves his tent! I absolutely recomend this toy! Great for rainy day fun or for when it is way too hot outside!"
positive,"Best use of live instruments and a Hip Hop masterpiece!!!!!!: Lauryn Hill has done something magical with the music in her new album. Sooo much soul and artistry. She is so elegant in her singing and her looks. She has evolved since her fugee experience. I'm looking forward to more solo projects, and I hope she gets all 10 of her grammy nominations!!"
positive,sticky: Garbage did it again! Another colletion of talented songs which sticks to your cerebral cortex and keeps you singing in the shower.
positive,"Great Cable great price only one knock ( on description): This cable works great used on my dvd player with easylink to tv. audio and video work right from the start no problems like other cables.Only knock i have is with the description, it states is Xbox 360 compatible, but cannot use this directly with an Xbox 360. You have to buy a Xbox Specific cable, not a so called compatible one."
negative,"Poor shipping: Covers where not on tight, or taped, leaked all over everything, including the two video games they brilliantly packed with it and the polish does not come off easy, everything is slimey, never mind that half the bottle is empty. I thought it was a set in a gift box but it was just thrown in a regular box, tipped in every direction. The cloth and sponges also had product all over them. Very disappointed and I've always had great experiences with Amazon."
negative,"Kerry Was Still Getting A Navy Paycheck As He Slandered GI's: Kerry was still on the U.S. Navy's payroll as he travelled the NE & MidAtlantic for Jane's Fonda's antiwar rallys. Kerry was an organizer in the group. Pretty sad how he was cashing U.S. Navy paychecks as he was smearing American GI's by calling them ""babykillers."" I guess there were no wealthy widows around so he need the paycheck.Kerry is no hero. He is an opportunistic back stabber. His cousin Stewart Forbes, Chief Executive Officer of Colliers International (Kerry's cousin), was awarded a contract worth billions designating Colliers International as the exclusive real estate agent representing Vietnam.This is after Senator Kerry sold out American POWs & MIAs while ""normalizing"" relations with the new Vietnam."
negative,"That one song is good...: Sometimes you buy an album for That One Song and hope to that That Song and a few others that are as good as That Song. Sometimes you only get That Song. I only got That Song. Not bad music, just not represented as a whole well by That One Song. If more of the songs were uptempo I'd probably listen to this album and not rest cold drinks on it."
negative,"Warning-this is taped @ SLP and is a multi-generation copy.: Do not buy this version - get the Warner Brothers version instead.This version, from Movies on Parade, is not worth buying. The production value is extremely low. The recording is of a very poor quality and portions are inaudible (particularly the critical riddle game with Gollum). At times the video 'skips' and it looks like it was taped on a machine that needed the heads cleaned.What a shame, as this is a otherwise a reasonable atttempt to take Tolkien's story and put it on the screen, remembering that it was done with 1970's technology and for children."
positive,"adult swim packaging: Excellent show. Adult Swim is being cheap with dvd packaging. ATHF, Venture Bros. Season 4.1, and Squidbillies vol. 3.1 ALL have SERIOUS lack of quality and artwork. I expect this is across the board. It's sad, I do not know what is happening here but my days of buying Adult Swim DVD seasons is over."
positive,"Love it..!: I bought this book about 1975 at a used book store. I read it every 4 or 5 years, it's a truly fun read. Not too deep, with some laughs. It's a story told through the eyes of one of the inhabitants of a mostly water planet with two suns. And his dealings with the ""alien"" in the purple suit. I highly recommend it."
positive,"Excellent book to guide women through the divorce process: This is a thoughtfully-written book by two experts that answers all the questions divorcing women should be asking themselves, from whether to hire a lawyer or mediator to how to manage money and a household after the divorce. Written by women for women, it describes what to expect at every stage of divorce and includes very specific information on how and where to get additional help and support. I would definitely give this book to a friend who was contemplating or going through a divorce."
positive,"hunting fishing trivia game: My kids played this game when it first came out when they were teenagers. I have just bought another one for one of my sons who wanted it for his sons. Very enjoyable if you like hunting, fishing and camping."
positive,"Astonishing, beautiful: This book truly touched me; it stirs thoughts of past, present and future and gives a new appreciation for the depth and beauty, the sadness and poignancy of them all. I would recommend this book to anyone I knew who enjoyed thoroughly touching, viscerally romantic stories about /people./"
negative,"Arkangel usually outstanding...but: The Arkangel audio CD's of Shakespeare's plays have an outstanding reputation. Most are really first rate and are quite enjoyable to listen to. Hamlet, MacBeth and Julius Caesar are very well done, complete plays well interpreted. Which is all the more baffling as to why Othello and Merchant of Venice are so notably bad. The overall productions and main players seem to have been chosen to project caricature rather than serious adaptation. That may be a fair point in a class room, but these two plays deserve a serious presentation."
positive,"Only one word can describe it...Unbelievable!: This, Oasis' third album, will forever raise the bar to which records are judged. ""Be Here Now"" exhibits a new found maturity that was lacking in the past two albums. Every track is massive. From the heart pounding ""D'You Know What I Mean?"", through the psychedelic ""All Around The World"", and culminating in the feel-good ""It's Gettin' Better (Man!!)"", ""Be Here Now"" will twist your mind in knots trying to remember every moment of every song. ""Be Here Know"" is only paralleled by the likes of Oasis' other two albums."
positive,"KYLIE NOW IS A 2 HIT WONDER IN THE UNITED STATES!: Kylie is back in the States! Though she was never missing from the pop music world always making music.She had one hit here many a years ago with a remake of ""Loco Motion"", other than that Kylies music career here has been a bust.But now she is back with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" which is currently #1 on the Dance Club Charts and already after just 3 weeks on Billboards Hot 100 is at #33 with a bullet.This song is getting heavy play on radio, video and anywhere else. With a high budget hot Devo-esque video for the new millenium and Kylie looking as though she hasn't aged a day. Could be digital computers, could be Kylie.However her first single off the forthcoming CD ""Fever"" is a catchy dance song that grows on you. A very subtle dance song with rhythmic beats and a catchy hook.I like it, and I think it is some of the best dance music to come from Kylie in a while."
positive,"Characteristics of Bad Writing: Plain Style was written in 1985 by Christopher Lasch, a history professor who was frustrated with his students' lack of writing ability. There are six sections:Elementary Principles of Literary ConstructionConventions Governing Punctuation, Capitalization, Typography, and FootnotesCharacteristics of Bad WritingWords Often MisusedWords Often MispronouncedProofreaders' MarksApparently Lasch's frustration with students went beyond just their writing skills. ""I keep simplifying my course in 20th century American history, but the students keep getting dumber faster than I can simplify it,"" Lasch wrote in a letter to his father. ""Every year the illiteracy gets worse.""The current book was published after the author's death and includes an introduction by Stewart Weaver. The introduction is disproportionately long, taking up 42 of 121 pages."
positive,"London bus scene worth price of admission.: If you like Brendan Fraser, then you will like this movie. I see that some people classify this as horror. I would say it's camp. An enjoyable reprise of the first movie. This edition also contains a digital copy of the movie, so you can pop it onto your ipod."
negative,"ADULTRY, LIES, PROFANITY and THEFT: This movie is shameful to say the lest! If you like Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensiblity, Mansfield Park, The Girl is not a romantic story at all. Movie will be a waste of time and money.Hannah is a thief from the very beginning as a child, she commits adultry, profanity is used throughout the movie every now and then. Not worth seeing, but you judge for yourselfBe warned!"
negative,"Very Bad Server+ Book: l bought this book long ago and only now have l read it and compared to other sybex books, this one is crap b/c the authors writing style is poor and annoying. Lots of pages l didn't even bother to read like the netware printout, his wife, his house and the glossary. Never again will l buy a book from this author and judging from the other reviews and the lack of books from him since then, this is a good thing. ls he even server+ certified?"
positive,"A new take on techno music: This is one of my favorite records now. This is a new direction for techno music. It is essentially Moby's take on the blues. It samples old field recordings and jazz records and makes them into songs that only amplify the feelings expressed in the original samples. By just using one or two lines throughout a whole song, it still makes an amazing emotional impact. this is a landmark album"
positive,"Couldn't put it down....: Yes, I'm a very big James Patterson fan, and he didn't let me down. Sam's Letters to Jennifer was great! I couldn't put it down. I love all of Patterson's books but the romantic ones are right up there with my other favorite author, Nicholas Sparks. A must read for any true romantic. Okay, maybe it wasn't as good as Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, but it will go on my shelf as one of my very favorites!"
positive,"IN YOUR FACE VIETNAM.: Take on the Cong with full scale invasions, teamwork required.Or, insurge as the Viet forces, and CRUSH the oppressers!AK-47-s to Huey Gunships, GGGET ERR DONNNNNE!! YYEAH!Fast paced deployment.Full integrated team commands, and still very popular online play.CULT CLASSIC"
negative,good idea's but has a religious context: I started reading and unexpectedly came across religious/Christian context. It was very off putting. Plus the book is a little out dated having a copyright from the 1990's.
negative,"What a long, boring book: I had to do this for school. I could hardly get through it. All they did was talk. It was long and boring. I HATED IT!"
negative,"Cheese enthroned: This is like a new genre of music - cheese metal, it sucks so bad that you don't even get angry with it, rather you feel sorry for the poor people in this god-awful band, and all the people who were misled into buying this or any other nightwish cd. The sound is like total cheesy motoristic rock with ridicules dickenson-like vocals distorted in the worst possible way...Ok if i had to pick one cd i would suggest you NOT to buy, this would come in second only to limp bizkit's chocolate starfish......."
positive,"A Man from Spanish Harlem Who Finds His Way: This is an intense no holds barred glimpse into the ugly world of drugs, addiction, self-analysis,and the criminal world. The author gives the reader a realistic view into the world that was apart of his daily existance while growing up in Spanish Harlem. He also makes a self-realization about his ethnic identity and his addiction to drugs. He shares his thoughts about being involved in the criminal elements that seemed to be all around him. The author offers graphic images of his experiences in Spanish Harlem, that remains with the reader long after finishing the book. The author's family struggles and his disappointing moments are things that most kids today experience in their lives. I believe this book can serve as an inspiration to anyone who has felt they were an outsider while growing up in a tough neighborhood."
positive,"Jane Fonda in ""Julia"": I had not seen this film since its initial release and to see it again 30 years later was a real treat. Both Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave shine in their roles in this excellent film based on Lillian Hellman's true life experience during war time. Fonda is at her best in this film playing Lillian Hellman and Vanessa Redgrave won an Academy Award for her performance as Julia. It is a movie not to be missed by serious film buffs."
negative,defective after 1 month: Cooked rice fine for the first month then suddenly burned out for no apparent reason. I didn't even have a chance to try out the porridge/soup cooker and steamer functions. Now I will have to ship it back to Sanyo for a replacement unit.
negative,"Only works with Topeak rack: I ordered this with the assumption that it will include a way to attach it onto my bike. I was mistaken. This fender only attaches to a certain bike rack. The description failed to mention this. Not happy with that, but I managed to McGyver it onto my bike. If you can get the thing onto your bike, it works great."
negative,"This book does not contain the 1855 edition!: While I adore the first edition of Leaves of Grass, this book is not as advertised. I definitely encourage you to buy it in another edition. I returned mine with a note, so hopefully Amazon will change the description soon."
negative,"HAS GRISHAM LOST HIS TOUCH?: Not since The Firm has Grisham managed to reach the same level of intensity. The Last Juror is awkward, predictable, and at times awfully dull. The Client and The Partner were close, but it seems to me that Grisham has succumbed to his fame and perhaps thinks people will like anything he writes. A Painted House, Bleachers, Skipping Christmas; yuck. I knew who the killer in this book was long before he was supposed to be, or should have been, exposed. If you feel you must buy this book simply because the author is Grisham, do yourself a favor and wait for the paperback."
negative,"Caveat Emptor: Buyer (of the Kindle edition) beware: The electronification of James Joyce's Ulysses hasn't quite got it yet: this Kindle edition is full of typos and odd punctuation. If you're planning on reading Joyce, you'd be better off with the hard copies for now; with maybe a free e-edition on your Kindle to supplement it, for those times when you're standing in line at the grocery store and can't be bothered to carry around 2 pounds of excellent literary deadweight."
positive,"Everyone impacts everyone else: We can be affected by people in the most unexpected places and ways. This story had me reflecting on people who crossed my path and left me changed - it also brought on more than a few tears. A simple, yet thought-provoking story."
positive,"LOVE IT!: I got my 1st Tivo 4 years ago and have never watched tv the same way again! The Dual Tuner Tivo is just as easy to use, plus you don't have to choose between 2 shows on at the same time. I recommend buying the Tivo box from a your local electronics store or online store, rather than going thru Tivos website and purchasing a ""monthly Tivo box plan"". In the long run, you'll save money -(as long as you don't wear it out or break it).GET IT AND YOU'LL NEVER REGRET IT!"
positive,"That Liverpool Humor: Only Kate from London got it right about the character played by Julie Waters. One reviewer stated that she was a cockney, and the other said she was a London housewife.Of course she was a Liverpudlian; one who is from Liverpool.The character would not have been nearly as funny had she been from any other place. The accent and Liverpool attitude is what makes this film work so well.One of my favorite movies. Have watched it about eight times over the years. It never looses its luster."
negative,"A long thank you: This book is in a real sense a long and general thank you letter to a generation. While the flavor of appreciation comes across as very real in this book I was hoping for a more acedemic and researched direction. I was dissapointed. The generation of the 40's deserves this book for the gratitude that it heaps on them, though I don't agree they are quite the saints as they are protrayed. Not much substance...Please some historian/writer follow the idea and write a proper book!"
positive,"Great computer, Great price!!!: you need to try this computer, it's great ... this is my 2nd apple, and I am very satisfied... I had a 15 inch apple, but bought this one, because it's size is more ideal for traveling.. I'm glad I bought it at amazon, for their FAST free shipping, and with the rebate, this is the place to buy the 12 inch Apple Ibook..."
positive,"System on an Up: This album is just amazing. System of a Down are definately a band we are going to hear a lot about in the not so distant future. Toxicity is quite different to their self titled debut, the music and vocals are much better, this is definately a band whom has musically matured.This is a very strong album, Serj Tankians lyrics are good but it is his vocal style which captures my attention. These songs are suprisingly catchy and Serj's range shines out, the guitar and drum work are commendable as well.This album is definately worth picking up. The strongest tracks are ""Prison Song"", ""Forest"" and ""Chop Suey"". The only weak track is ""Jet Pilot"" which really is why i did not give this album 5 stars.System of a Down are definately on an up."
positive,Pack spidy up for the academy arwards.: Spider man is fun for me tell you get to let's say the 4th level. But It is a good game. The most challengeing level is the 2nd one. Here you can try to get out a collapsing building. Just remember to watch out for the bad guys. The sound is awsome. Unlike Pacman collection you can save your score and save the game. The color is nice exept in a dimm room It's hard to see without a GBA worm light [And I can see frogger in the same room]. You need a plan to get into level 5 [which I haven't figured out yet] because you need stratgy to get to level 5 and keep your helth up. Kids under 6 probaly need to wait a year or two. In this game you can live the movie and have a ball.
negative,"Most young girls will love it: I did, at age 8 or so, though, re-reading it today, I find itrather grim and dull. Also, as I learnt some years ago in my teachingdays, this is not a book to be used in the classroom. It is best savedfor long winter days, when reading a chapter can be a daily visit withappealing friends.Much of it is way too puritanical for mytaste. Daughters cannot so much as have their rare good breakfast onChristmas Day, and presents need to be sacrificed because how can oneenjoy oneself when soldiers are not? But the characters are oftenvivid, and the relationships between the sisters are quiterealistic.That said, it does tend to be a winner. The very youngtend to focus on the fun parts rather than the New Englandcongregationalist preaching ... don't spoil it for them, at the youngage, by telling them just why the Alcotts, on whom this work wasbased, were the ""poor"" outcasts in the wealthyneighbourhood. END"
positive,"Students of Jude, Keep Reading: I am generally of the opinion that a review of a work of art should be an honest expression of one's feelings or thoughts concerning the work in question. ... That said, ""Jude the Obscure"" is an extremely challenging novel. But, the tragedy of Jude can be appreciated by anyone that possesses the capacity to think rather than the ability to regurgitate sentiments that can be read in any commentary on the novel. I want to encourage every student out there who wishes to read ""Jude the Obscure"" for what it really is - an enlightening and engrossing story. These are the people who will understand the meaning of the novel."
negative,"Sorry, but these were the worst blades ever!: I bought two packs from Save-a-lot. I'm sorry to say but these were the worst blades I've ever seen.The clip broke on over half of them and the blades were dull. It was like they pulled the hair out instead of cutting. I will NEVER order blades on-line again."
positive,"A great edition!: I love the Cambridge School series of Shakespeare's plays because of the way it helps you along as you read. Not only does it explain the language, but it explains the Elizabethan puns and points out things that you would have never noticed. I recommend this book to everyone, especially teachers for their classes."
positive,"Sheer madness, meticulously documented: Yes, all the reviews are correct: This is an excellent writer detailing some of the most gruesome killings of all time. It is the fastest 650 pages you will ever read, I gaurantee it.One note: This book might also be called ""Vincent Bugliosi: The Man Who Brought Down Charles Manson And Lived to Tell About It."" That is to say, Bugliosi is evidently proud (rightfully so) of his accomplishment as the lead prosecutor on the case. And he pretty much makes mincemeat out the intellect of the LAPD and the defense attorneys involved. But like any good prosecutor (and Bugliosi is most certainly that) he has quite a bit of evidence to back his charges of ineptitude. If I were Kanarek, or a Tate detective, I'd be pretty embarrassed knowing this book is an all-time bestseller.But who are we kidding, this is the definitive book on Tate-Labianca. A truly fantastic read."
positive,"Keeps me warm at night: This sleeping bag keeps me warm... I have yet to use it outside, but when sleeping in the car, watching TV, or having sack-races... it's a good buy."
positive,"journey to a different time...: ...when musicians made their music without the aid of synthesizers of mixers or computerized studio workstations. Not only is ""Freddy"" (as he is affectionately called by fans) the King of Oud, he has a magical voice. There is a craftsmanship and depth to his music that I really enjoy."
negative,"Truly awful!!!!!!!!!!!!: I read some reviews here and elsewhere that sounded positive, but honestly this film was AWFUL. My friend and I seriously discussed leaving after the first 20 minutes (somthing I have never done before), but decided to stick it out and hope that it would get better. It did, but only marginally. I ended up wishing that I had walked in the first place and not wasted my time and $9.00 on this sea of stupid lines and pointless ""plot"". It was insulting to both Hawaiians and Trans-gender people and most of all was NOT FUNNY, truly. I like Drew Barrymore, and Adam Sandler when he is playing a character with a brain in his head--and there is chemistry between these actors(...). Rent The Wedding Singer instead. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY--if you are over the age of 11 this film is too immature for you. And if you are under the age of 11 you will be bored."
negative,"Had to return due to allergy reaction!: Be aware these diapers may cause an irritation on sensitive skin, to my son it was like he was burnt on his tummy, genitals and bottom. Each changing time was hell and cries like I was peeling off his skin. I switched for huggies natural cotton and evrything is fine now."
negative,"D.O.A.: X-Acto heavy duty is dead on arrival. It could not sharpen a single pencil, just made humming noise. Will have to send it back. Like I have nothing else to do. I am out of luck with pencil sharpeners. The iPoint one I bought before at Costco never worked well and would always get stuck so I had to return it. People, recommend something decent, please!"
positive,"FINALLY - a mug warmer that actually works!!: I ordered this mug warmer with a little skepticism, as I had ordered a similar product in the past only to be very disappointed with the results. The Mr. Coffee mug warmer, however, lives up to its claim and keeps my coffee nice and hot to the last drop. It's funny how something so mundane and inexpensive can bring such joy, but this one really delivers. If you hate luke warm coffee, this is your best bet!"
negative,"Bad written - Wasted money: I think this book isn't worth the money you pay for it. Ray Bradbury does not describe the story very elaborate and and so e.g. it is very difficult to understand what the people are talking about.Furthermore, the tension the fireman acts with doesn't get clear in the description by Bradbury. This is a very bad style of telling a story and makes me think the author himself didn't like the story.The dialogues between the fireman, Montag, and the girl he meets on the street are forced and do not seem vivid. So it is a great effort reading it.I have to read this book at school and I do not have any motivation to analyze it."
negative,"1: ive bought some cheap and bad games in my day but wow! really, this is the crappiest game i have ever bought. i finished it but was contastantly reminded how lame the gameplay was ALL THE WAY through the game. if you want to try a cheap game like this one that is good, get conan for a few bucks."
positive,"spirited: My brother lives in Bangkok and I've been there many times so I was keen to see what a novel set there would be like and I wasn't disappointed - Mr Moore evokes the seediness and poverty without it appearing soul-destroyingly hopeless because he manages to balance it with interesting characters (both the good, the bad and the humanly flawed), a good mystery and moments of beauty and humour. I enjoyed it and intend to try the next one..."
positive,"The Best Voice and CD ever: This CD is pure gold and I recommend this masterpiece and it soothes the ear and soul. It's the best CD ever and he should have won the competetion. If you don't like him you will because this CD will make a fan out of anyone, this artist should winn so many Grammys and I hope he does."
negative,"Dual Moniter support doesn't work with 2 CRT's: I bought this card to because it is a reasonably priced dual moniter card. I have two CRT's (21"" and 19"") and wanted to increase my desktop real estate. It does not work well for this purpose. Installation was easy in my Dell 8100 system, but there is only one vga plug on the card, the other is DVI. Great if you have a LCD, but otherwise you must use an expensive adapter... Anyway, the output from the DVI port is of very poor quality. This may be because of the adapter, but regardless. it does not have a useful second output. Too bad, now I'm trying to use two separate card, which will be much harder to configure."
negative,I Hate It: Halloween 3 was one of the most Pathetic Movies ever made If you are a hardcore fan of Michael Myers you will Cry I only Got this just to have all of them
positive,The best jazz cd if not the best ever: Pat metheny and Jaco on bass are awsome toghter. the guitar on the cd is out of this world and it aslo as awsome paino and bass. Its hard to say how good this cd is you have to hear it for yourself. Art has its mona lisa jazz has pat metheny.AMIPLY AMAZING!
positive,"my first insight into greek culture and history: I'm 16 and before i read this book i had no knowledge of greek civilization other than the History channel. I really enjoyed this book, despite my ignorance of that time period. It was very educational while providiing interesting facts that made it seem less like a text book. It took me quite a while to finish it, but it was definitly worth it."
negative,Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers Cold Wax Strips 18's: Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers Cold Wax Strips 18's didn't really did not work for me so I will not be buying this brand anymore
negative,"""The Night Nobody Cared"": ah...um...well, my brother picked this up not too long ago, and , well...it sucks! it's the WORST of the whole series!i thought it would have to do with the mask Michael wears in the others, but not a FICKEN THING!!!!!!!!!!!!I gave it two stars because i liked the killing scene in the hospital, but then i took one because of how bad the rest was..."
negative,"Not scary at all!: The original was scary, but this is just an excuse to use special effects. This isn't scary, or funny, and should be on MST3K. Yes this movie is that bad. All the bad things you've heard about this movie, are truly an understatement to how bad it REALLY IS! This is ..., and will always be .... Sorry hollywood, but don't try again. We are a little harder to scare now. This would scare a 3 year MAYBE... but even that is giving it to much credit. Skip this and see something else."
negative,2-D caricature of a black comedy: This movie is awful. I am neither a Drew Barrymore fan nor a detractor. It seems her fans are the few that actually like this movie. The plausibility factor is zero which absolutely guts the humor premise. A good part of my tastes embrace dark humor but this movie looks more like an elaborately staged non-funny improv. They were reaching for Repo-Man but managed to bottom out under Peggy Sue Got Married instead. If you read all the reviews you will find someone who mentions this is the stinker they use to grade all the other movie farts. I agree whole-heartedly with that assessment.
negative,"Merely a short story: I found this ""novel"" to be one of the poorest I have read to date. The characters are not developed, the story line was weak and it lacked imagination. It seemed as if Mr. Patterson stopped by a bar one night and jotted it down on a napkin! It should have been labeled as no more than a short story.I believe the last time I read a book with such a large font, two inch margin on all four sides and less than 200 words per page ---- I was in the third grade!! New chapters were used as a way of extending the story/number of pages --- they were not used as a means to express a new idea or thought.Take my advice -- do not waste your time or money."
negative,"Complete garbage glass is almost as thin as paper: I ordered 2 sets of these and gave one to a friend as a gift. He was making us a couple of cocktails put the lid on the shaker and within the first shake it shattered. My set 3 glasses broke the first use. This is the cheapest quality glass I have ever seen. As soon as you unpack the item and handle a glass it feels like it could break in your hand. The glass at the local dollar store is fine china compared to this junk! I believe in the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" but in this case you dont get anywhere close to getting what you pay for. I only paid $8 with free shipping!"
negative,"save your $$$: I can't believe how much this cd sucks, save yourself 17 bucks & just download the ""we on fire"" mp3 its the only decent track on the album. And if u r looking for more ""bounce"" party tracks like ""back that ass up"" too bad; u won't find any here. What a rip."
positive,Wonderful book: Wonderful book- very informative. Cakes will be challenging but the directions are very clear. Not for a new cake baker but for the more experienced it is wonderful.
positive,"Biggest Bang Since Some Girls: A Bigger Bang is a great comeback by the Stones. Ron Woods slide on Rough Justice gets it off to arolicking start. It wont take long has good guitar.Rain Kept Falling has a Miss you vibe. Streets of Love is great. Back of my Hand continues the Stones great blues legacy. Laugh i Nearly Died is good blues too. The rock songs Oh No not you Again, Dangerous Beauty and Look At What The Cat Dragged In, make A Bigger Bang the best Stones cd since Some Girls."
positive,"Ulysses: This is possibly the greatest fictional work of the 20th century. I have no intention of enlarging on that. This particular edition is of the 1961 text, and contains the judgement of the U.S. obscenity trial. An inexpensive well-made book from Modern Library.Just buy it , read it and then reread it. I've been doing that for more than 50 years."
negative,"junk: As others have experienced, mine starts a a charge/battery/charge cycle that is maddening, and probably no good at all for the battery. Don't buy."
negative,Good when it works.: I had my Tassimo for about 4 years - never once had a problem. In fact I still have it...thank god because this is the third time IN ONE YEAR that I have had to pull it out to replace my keurig. this thing is ridulous - I don't use it any more than I did my Tassimo. If Tassimo just added more options my Keurig would be in the garbage!
negative,"Recipe for disaster: My girlfriends were acting so weird I finally asked one what was going on. She said my boyfriend had been hitting on every woman in our circle. I called my sister to boo-hoo and she said he had tried with her, too.After I kicked him out, my sister and I were turning the mattress and I found this book. My sister said this was the stuff he was trying. We called my girlfriends over to party and we read this silly system out loud. What a hoot! Women can't read a single page without laughing.I found out why my friends were acting so weird. My boyfriend's act was so obvious that my friends thought I must be testing them to see if they would betray me. The Valentine System is so juvenile that every woman who has read it giggles that no one smart enough to read is stupid enough to believe any of this will work.All these rave reviews testify that only dorky men would buy this book. If you need The Valentine System, you need a lot of OTHER things money won't buy."
negative,not for the verizion pearl: none of the cut outs for the buttons on the case match up for use with the verizon 8130 i was hoping since so cheap but did not work for me.
positive,Greatest book since I read the Tarzan novels: Aside from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan novels no other book has captured my imagination like John Carter has. I'm not much of a book reader and loved all of the Tarzan novels and have every one of them in origianl print and since I have read A princess of Mars I am looking forward to purchasing the whole Barsoom series and cannot wait to read them all.
positive,"""The Mountaion of Silence"" by Kyriacos Merkides: The book is informative, historically correct, and keeps the reader wanting to read more. Brings alive the traditional goal of The Eastern Orthodox Church - THEOSIS.Rev. Dr. Christopher Eriksson"
positive,"Brilliant: Once again Pitchshifter seems to have outdone themselves. With cuts like ""Hidden agenda"" and ""Condescension"" How can one go wrong. With Pitchshifter's hard-edged combination of punk, techno, and metal; and the brutal social commentary, this easily became one of my favorties."
negative,"Good story, poorly written...: I did not enjoy this book at all.In my opinion, this book tends to be a bit wordy and boring. The dialogue can be hard to follow at times, especially if you are unfamiliar with English slang of that time period. I had to force myself to read it, and the only reason I did so was because it's a classic. Although I get the point and I understand why the book has appeal, the writing didn't speak to me at all. Even if the story itself is good, and even though there is an underlying meaning that is worth conveying, to me, it's not worth dredging through the muck that is the writing in order to understand it.It's really quite unfortunate."
negative,"This movie should have been called ""Morons"": What is the point of this movie? To prove that there are really stupid teens living in the city with nothing more to do than talk about ""gettin' some"" all day?The acting in this film is pretty good but that is where my praise stops. I found this film to be a repulsive steaming pile with no redeeming value.If I was Chloe Sevigny, or anyone else involved in the making of this film, I would be embarassed to have my name on it."
negative,"Bleeds potential....but needs work: I was kind of looking forward to this album ,considering everything i had heard about it, so i listented to it 2 times all the way through and wanted to break someting. It is overall a very relaxing album that peaks nicely with spots of genius, but the whole album seemed choppy from song to song. The Quiet parts were too long and tempted me a lot to fast forward,and the worst part is that the good parts are so good that it almost seems like two different people were making this album. Who ever made this album obviously has enough talent to do a little better. Part of me thinks that this was just some exrcise in editing and production to try to push the boundries of what one could call an album."
negative,LACKING: BEEN THERE AND THE BOOK WAS SOMEWHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. NEEDED MORE INTERESTING STORY FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL PLACE. MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WILL WRITE A BETTER BOOK ABOUT THE PLACE.
negative,"POS if you want to set up a more secure system: I bought it for the price (it was on sale). I have DSL so the .b speed is plenty. Worked initially when there was not much security. But, the moment you enabled WAP etc, it worked when the PC was on, but lost its settings after a reboot. You have to enter wep keys every time !!! Tech support -- after loooooog waits, flounders around, abliet very politely. After 2-3 calls, they escsalated the levels to ""level 3"" who was supposed to call back with a solution, but does not. Basically, they will drag / delay etc till you give up & tey do not have to honor the lifetime warranty they advertise. Also, I had XP related problems (as did a few others). I have been working on PCs for 20 yrs, and this is a bust. Avoid if you want security. If you live in the farm and do not care about neighbors, I think it will work provided you do not load the adapter with encryption etc."
positive,Brilliant: TOXIC AVENGER 4 IS AN AMAZING MOVIE. hillarious and filled with violence the DVD is packed with extras including 3 commentaries deleted scenes and a full lengtht documentary on the making of toxie 4 . The best Toxic avenger movie gets one of the best dvd of the past year.
positive,"I, Robot: Will Smith has become a great action star, showing his ability to draw audiences to watch his action packed movies, such as 'Independence Day' and 'Bad Boys'. This movie is another action packed movie and is taken in the future, and is supposed to be a glimps of what could happen to man kind if machines could think for themselves. And yes, it goes on the same story lines where we struggle with our own creation in movies such as the ""Terminator"" series, etc. Again, we have a movie pointing the potential dangers of machine vs. man, which is the ultimate battle. Besides, some flaws in the movie, where the previews show Will saying to his boss, "" I sure miss the good old days...when people killed people.."" in the movie, they have the boss saying it to Will's character instead. But regardless of the few other mishaps, Will Smith's performance and personality with the great action scences makes up for it."
negative,"Didn't Like It: Jesse Stuart is a school teacher from Kentucky and should have stayed that way. This book seemed like an attempt to get attention in 1949 for his teaching skills. He my have been a good teacher but he wasn't a good writer.The Thread That Runs So True never caught my attention. The book was dull and boring. The book wasn't worth my $14.00. Jesse Stuart gets too much in detail with his story. A lot of the time he is talking about his money troubles and give us acual estimates. The Chicago Sun my have said ""stuart's joy for living illuminates every page."" but I never saw that illumination. I would never recommend this book to anyone."
negative,I did not buy this: I do not know why this is in my folder. I did not buy it as far as I know. You may remove it from the survey if you wish.
positive,"Vacuum for ""Wet"" pick ups !!: This little vacuum is ""Great""!! Light to handle, easy to use and no bags. Spill a drink - no problem, grab your ""Vac"" plug in the 20 foot cord and vacuum the spill in seconds. The unit steams stains away, then vacuums up the dirt with the water. Has an adjustable steam control, move from low-intensity to high-intensity for those stubborn messy stains. It was designed by Sharper Image."
positive,"It grows on you: The first time I listened to this CD, I thought it was okay. But the more I listened, the more I appreciated it. I burned a bunch of my CD's onto my computer at work and included this CD in the mix. I've noticed that whenever one of these songs comes up in the playlist I always notice it. Clay's voice stands out and I think it will stand the test of time. I can't wait until his next CD!"
positive,"The Cool Gizmo: I think the megaman PET is really cool. It is really cool that I can have my very own NetNavi like Lan and Chaud on the Megaman TV show. I get to fight viruses like Lan and enter tournaments once you bet 10 viruses.Then you can battle against rival NetNavis and use battlechips.I also like the fact that you can battle against your friends. The only thing I don't like is that when Megaman loses a battle, it takes a long time to shake him back to full health. But I do a little cheat so I don't have to. The cheat is this. If you are battling a virus and you know you are about to lose, leave the PET alone for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, the PET should be turned off by itself. When you turn it back on megaman should be back on the standby screen and the virus should have ran away. Overall I think the PET is very cool."
negative,"Nothing especially helpful for surfing: This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of 'namaste' B.S. to go around. The poses are fine and good, but the video doesn't really offer up any yoga that is different and specific to surfing. Maybe that's because yoga in general is just good for surfing, I don't know ... but I was expecting more.Save your money and just go to a real class."
negative,"Cheaply made!: These weights break apart VERY easily...the material is very cheap. They don't last and not worth the money, even on sale"
positive,"highly recommended!: Break-up into timed sections, question length and content and subjects covered pretty closely matched my exam, which I took 2 weeks ago. Answers to questions explain why one answer is correct and why the others are wrong. Also gives helpful test-taking tips and advice. Highly recommend it!"
positive,"thank you for paving the way for me: bryan wilson is da bomb! I am a singer myself and i know good talent when i hear it. and when he sang ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"", it blow me away! He is phenomenal and I love to hear him sing because he feels what he is singing about and what singing really is--the anointing you put into it, not the show so many people try to put on. I wish you much success in the future to come. Maybe I'll get to sing with you when I come out. May God forever bless you in your music ministry! Much love, Your sister in Christ, Connie"
negative,"The Worst DVD, period: The movie was funny at times. The DVD is horrible. There is nothing ""extra"" about it. The VHS version has more ""extras"" than the DVD.Huh?Avoid this like the plague."
positive,"Excellent Sourcebook: Excellent collection of essays- some repetitive, all comprehensive, accompanied by extremely good illustrations and photographs."
positive,"One of the great ones!: I've been waiting for this one on DVD for as long as I've had a DVD player. A true classic! One of George Cukor's best -- and he directed a lot of great movies! Based on the play, this taut drama brings us one of the great villians of all time. Boyer is not some scenery-chewing, soap-opera villian shouting and throwing tantrums. No, he's a soft, purring villian, a loving, concerned husband who is in truth driving his wife mad. She never looked better and Cotton is at his best. Check out the young Angela Landsbury too. Wonderful movie. I don't want to give it away. Just buy it -- you will not regret it!"
negative,"Where is her tell-tale wit?!: I was so disappointed with this book! I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's books under the name SK and have read all of them many times, but this was the first book I'd read written under her name Madeleine Wickham. I thought the story was incredibly boring. There is no humor and no one is remotely witty! The characters were all one-dimensional and not lovable at all like her other female heroines. Nothing happened and the pace was unbearably slow. I plan to read other books under the name Madeleine Wickham because the woman herself is a fabulous writer, but I didn't see her regular spark in Cocktails for Three at all."
positive,"Depression Management: This is an excellent audio tape that explains what clinical depression is. It is a good starting point to help a person recognize what they are feeling. The side on anxiety management is for heavy problems. It might have been better to make two different tapes, but I still would highly recommend it.I've given this tape to people who are obviously hurting. It is a way to help someone help themselves. It is easier to comprehend than reading a book on depression. Plus, it gives you a way to help when you see someone in pain."
positive,"Happiness all around: My wife is very happy with this set of dishes that we recently purchased through Amazon.com. They are everything she had hoped and expected them to be. My happiness is more related to the purchasing experience. One dish arrived broken and I was very pleased with the efficient, fast and convenient way you handled the replacement. Thanks for a good buying experience.Bob Cordes"
negative,"Well I seem to be alone: As an actor involved in the production of several of the plays from all in the timing, while I've found that the plays certainly are all memorable, and very clearly written by an INCREDIBLY intelligent person, far too often these plays suffer from being flat out unfunny. No, theyre not unfunny. The jokes just, far too often, come, and simply refrain from BEing funny. It's unfortunate. The Universal Language is a play that is always FUN to do, and one that will never leave peoples brains, but it's not entertaining because of any wit. This is what tends to happen to Ives. He gets going, and write a great play, but the characters don't have much depth, are not particularly interesting to play, and don't manage to actually be comical too frequently, so it's really not worth it to want to participate in the plays. (With the GRAND exception of The Death of Trotsky)"
positive,"The Abyss: Special Edition is a GREAT DVD!: ""The Abyss:Special Edition"" is the best DVD I've seen yet. First, the movie is one of the greatest science fiction films I've ever seen. It has a great story, written by James Cameron (""Titanic, ""Aliens,"" ""The Terminator,"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day), which is smart, fast-paced, and very exciting. It has awesome special effects, especially the giant wave at the end of the movie. And, the acting, well done by the leading actor, Ed Harris, who was also great in ""The Truman Show.""Second, the EXTRAS ARE EVEN BETTER! It has an excellent 60-minture documentary (don't watch the 10-minute one, it's a promotional featurette), storyboards, theaterical trailers, and countless special effects featurettes, and there are still countless more special features.Now, I all I want you to do now, is to go buy this DVD, if you are a serious science-fiction fan, and you want a great DVD loaded with special features. You won't be disappointed."
positive,Good: Works well. I used them with my washer and dryer so I could clean behind the washer and dryer great for the price
negative,"Crap...: I wish there had been SOMETHING in the product description that said these diapers were SCENTED! You'd think you'd have to claim that. Now, who knows if i'll be able to return them as i did open the package, only to find they are scented. my kids can't wear these!"
positive,"Corrupt U. S. Government NOT PROTECTING ANIMALS!: ""Stolen for Profit"" is beyond a five star book. This is the most enlightening book I have ever read. I wish everyone in America could read this book. Do you know that the U. S. Department of Agriculture lisenses ""dealers"" to sell to medical research? Do you know that these ""dealers"" are stealing your pets on a regular basis? They look at animals as MONEY and nothing else. We have to fight back. The best way to begin is by reading this book. WE CAN STOP ANIMAL ABUSE IN THIS COUNTRY! Let politicians know that you will vote for NO CANDIDATE THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS ANIMAL RIGHTS!"
negative,"Terribly Overrated: For the life of me, I will never understand the craze about this film. The acting ranged from terrible to 2nd rate, the special effects were too heavy, character development was virtually nonexistent. For a film that has been called the next Indiana Jones, everything in this film is lesser than Speilberg's and Lucas' superb adventure trilogy. I mean, what the heck was up with this film anyway? Brendan Fraser's trying to be an action hero, but also a comedian, just did not work as he never neared achieving either goal. The deaths of several of the good characters had no effect, as we never really got to know them. Not once DURING THE ENTIRE MOVIE was I on the edge of my seat, though it was all I could do to not lean comfortably back and fall asleep in it. Okay, perhaps that's an overstatement and a bit harsh, but this film is not as good as the critics say!"
negative,"Yeah, it's pretty bad.: A lamentable adaptation of the classic ""Three Musketeers"" saga. This film looks stylish, but is appallingly dreadful in its cliche-ridden script and clumsy execution... To begin with, trash all hope of seeing Alexandre Dumas's grand story in a millennial revamp -- the script takes such liberties with the original material that we should consider ourselves lucky they remembered to call the hero D'Artagnan. The big deal with this film is supposed to be the Hong Kong-style ""wire works"" action scenes, which were choregraphed by Xin-Xin Xiong, of ""Crouching Tiger"" fame... Well, there is no dragon hidden in these sequences -- they are both kinetically flat and a distracting anachronism: I don't think the French palace guard ran up the side of buildings, ninja style... so why pretend they did? This movie is full of failed attempts at wackiness and bonhomie... Pity poor Stephen Rea and Tim Roth who, as the bad guys, had to attempt to carry this film all on their own. Zzzzzzzzzz."
negative,"ALOT of angry mornings: This is the absolute WORST coffee pot I have ever purchased! After only a couple days,it stopped brewing! I went online and found out ths probem was very common,and they have a technique called ""burping"" it,which became a very routine thing,and sometimes burping oesn't work,and I'll go up to a week with it out of comission. It needs to constantly be descaled,absolute garbage of an overpriced product."
negative,"Worst Bass I Have Ever Heard: I got these very cheap with a coupon so they totalled below 3 dollars shipped. They are not really worth even that. In iTunes, I have set the bass on its absolute lowest settings and I can still barely hear non-bassy sound. The bass interference is so heavy that I cannot even hear the words to songs without modifying the equalizer heavily. I called the company about it and they said that it was typical for the model."
positive,its one of those movies: this is one of those movies that when it ends you sit there and think about it and how amazingly good it was. most movies you leave the theater with your friends and forget the movie 5 minutes later because there are more important things there like girls and food. anybody who gave this movie under 4 stars was probably sidetracked when they saw it or was some history teacher that cant stand innaccurate movies. and theres always the people that are obsessed with chickens and whatnot who should be ignored anyways. this movie just seems like its on a different level than all the movies being pumped out today for cash.
negative,"Call Me Insane, but I Wasn't Feelin' This: My taste in dance music is as diverse as anyone else's. I really dig soulful house, trance, two-step, and drum and bass. MoS has been one of the few labels that has consistently steered me in the right direction in terms of good dance music, but their winning streak ends here. I really liked the 2002 Ibiza guide, but this mix by Judge Jules didn't do it for me. We get nondescript, hyperactive trance numbers that start off promisingly but don't take off well. It would have been nice if we got more vocals and more variety, but I guess that doesn't really matter if this is blasting while you're at the club severely intoxicated. I'm actually VERY glad I got this used because if I paid the full import price, I would not have been a happy camper. While I'm sure this will appeal to some, this guide to Ibiza was a disappointment."
positive,The Duke at his finest: I simply love John Wayne movies and this is one of my favorites....which is rare since I love his westerns the most. He is fabulous in personifying Red Adair.....great movie that even my son can watch.
negative,"completely silly!: Who would give the green light to this?It is a total remake of the 1968 classic. The only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times.Since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it...it pales in comparison to the original. This was really weird to remake this movie.""Dawn of the Dead"" was cool b/c it had a new, fresh spin to the story. This has no scares, no atmosphere, no innovations and no riveting performances.Skip this one"
negative,"THIS IS A CHILDREN'S BOOK: I like to think I have read a lot of books in my day, and the most important thing to keep in mind when reading something is know the context of what is being written, make no mistake, this book was written for people too immature to read Harry Potter. The plot and characters are underdeveloped. The whole thing is a huge Tolkien ripoff (but so is most Fantasy). This book is for first time fantasy readers who are 8 to 12. But before reading this i would recomend reading Harry Potter and the Wheel Of Time so you have and idea of what good Fantasy is.i will admit it was entertaining but anyone who gives this 5 stars needs to read a Game of Thrones by George RR Martin and know what quality fantasy is. This is not quality, it is some kid trying to scrape money together to pay for college and taking the easy way out without making his book worth reading."
positive,The most amazing book in the world!!!: I would recommend this book to every citizen of this planet. I have read millions of books and this by far is my favorite!! The most amazing!!!
positive,"tragic love creates author: I loved this story. Looking at Becoming Jane was enjoyable on so many levels. First I loved theperformances of Anne Hathaway and all the family Austen. I particularly watched James McAvoy...I hadseen him in Atonement, but in this movie he is particularly appealing and watchable. I highly recommendletting go of any prejudices against sentimentality and just look at the landscapes and feelings ofEngland at his time of life. Watching this makes me more appreciative of LOVE and LIFE in the now."
negative,"Very old fashioned: I'm sure this was a great book at the time of publishing. But now, it's just very old fashioned.Many of the rules wouldn't applying these days, particularly on the web.I would have preferred a main focus on ""writing that works"", rather than a mix of different types of writing (letters, presentations, resumes, etc...). It doesn't cover any of those topics enough and you can definitely find online much better guides for each of them."
positive,"Best Dirty Irish Cd ever ;): Harry Bradley, originally from Belfast, has mastered the ""dirty"" style of Irish flute playing, where the player plays with a pulsing breath that pushes the lower octave notes to get a very distinctive tone. If you listen to Irish Flute music, you don't need me to tell you who Harry Bradley is. If you've never heard Irish flute music before, this is a great cd to start with (every Irish flute player has or belongs to a distinctive style; you can try Matt Malloy and Kevin Crawford for others). Look also for Harry's flute duet cd with Michael Clarkson, ""The Pleasures of Hope""(great stuff) and his other album ""Bad Turns and Horseshoe Bends"" is also excellent. I think you can download an mp3 to see if you like it; I recommend ""Miss Thornton's/The Primrose Lasses"", the third track on the cd which is a great set of tunes that also demonstrate the Belfast/dirty style of playing."
positive,Cleaned it almost good as new!: This product did all it claimed to. I used it on a percolator coffee pot that was over 8 years old. This pot made consistantly 1 to 2 pots of coffee per day over that time period. Dip-it cleaned the metal to a like-new shine. The coffee made from it now tastes fresher as well. This is a good product.
negative,"Scary when I was little, not years later.: I first found this book when i was little--and yeah, then it scared me more. I found it recently in barns and nobles, and wanted to buy it to re read it. Big mistake.This book is more hysterical than scary to me. I didn't even feel a little scared. Big disappointment for me. my advice? read it when you are younger, it might acutally be scary then."
positive,"Warriors is the best series in the world!: After reading this very book, I found I was hooked straight away on Warriors, and was excited about reading the next book in the series. I bought book after book in the series, until finally, I had all of them. Soon, I will order the 5th book in the 2nd series: Twilight, and am really looking forward to reading it. When I am in the middle of reading one, I am so engrossed so that I feel as if I'm in their world, hunting and fighting for survival. I love all of them so much that I've read all of them at least 5 times already - I only started reading them a year ago - and I'm positive that none of them will ever get boring. I do certainly reccomend them, as I love them so much!"
negative,"Not worth the money..: I bought this after looking at the description hoping that this will be the answer for ease my neck pain. Unfortunately, It did not. I tried both Hot & cold therapy using this. Neither is effective. First, the collar does not fit properly around your neck (for an average sized person).Second, Even after you strap the collar you cannot feel the Heat/Cold that much. Then i found out that the collar is not touching the skin on the sides of the neck. Also, the heat or cold lasts only very few minutes (Max. 5). Overall, I'm very disappointed. Definitely, not worth the money. My Drugstore Cold pack was much more effective."
negative,"Great Coffee when the brewing system works: We love this coffeemaker. It makes delicious coffee quikly. Depending on the situation, I enjoy the donut shop and breakfast blends.In our experience, the coffeemaker fails at an alarming rate. We went through three of them in a matter of weeks. Fortunately, the service department was helpful in acquiring a new one when the old one failed. The old ones were a few days to a few weeks old when they died.The fourth coffeemaker lasted some time. It could have been 5 months. To our dismay, it failed recently.We want a coffeemaker with some build quality that last. We might consider the Breville version of the coffee maker."
negative,"guess i'm out of step: i suppose it's possible that men of the 442nd spoke as the characters in the book, but i just can't quite picture it. i wasn't in the 442nd, or in WWII, but i did serve in Marine infantry in Vietnam, and these characters just don't ring true with me. infantrymen are tired, tense, sore, filthy, and smell bad. they're thirsty and sometimes hungry. they usually don't have time to be afraid, even when the fecal matter hits the fan. nobody i ever heard (before arriving in the Nam) wondered (aloud, at least) how they would perform in combat. when they don't like one another it's usually a lot more direct."
positive,"Hot Lead & Cold Feet: I really enjoyed this movie. It was very entertaining and a good, clean movie for the whole family. It has good moral values to it. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys the fun, enjoyable times with their whole family. Did I mention it was a clean movie? No cussing!! Kids movies these days add curse words to them for some stupid reason. You'll enjoy this film, I'm sure."
positive,"A very worthwhile investment: Previous to reading this book, I knew only that ASP meant Active Server Pages and that you could access databases with it. I knew nothing else, and this book gave me all the information that I was looking for.I found the examples very useful, especially in terms of accessing databases which is really why I bought it. The CD comes with all the source code, and I'm now happily ASPing away!I only have one criticism (and it's a small one); I would like to see a bigger section on VBScript, and perhaps a command reference at the back of the book.Well worth the money."
positive,"Very solid: I thoroughly enjoyed this game when I purchased it a few months ago, and still hop on occasionally if nothing else is going on. The player movements and mechanics are some of the best i've seen in a sports game.DEAD are the days where a player is attached to the ball as they run... now the ball has its own speed and force and the player needs to be careful or else it'll get away from them.A bit hard to get a hold of the shooting at first- but it's no harder than real life I'd say. Good level of customization and nicely detailed leagues with plenty of info.Highly recommended!"
negative,"A fundamentally dishonest book: The title of my review is 'a fundamentally dishonest book'...and it is.This book is a collection of articles by various authors on the subject of the Ainu people.There is a political orientation to this book.The editors,and many of the authors,make much effort to debunk 'the Caucasoid theory'.While there are a great many photographs of Caucasian looking Ainu people in existence from a century ago,there are very few such photos in this book,and I believe that is a very deliberate choice by the editors.Many of the authors make reference to the Ainu as having Caucasian appearance and yet the reader is left wondering what they are referring to when in the book nearly all of the pictures of Ainu are of Mongoloid appearance (these Ainu are obviously mixed with Japanese)."
positive,"A Good Intermediate Book: I've read tonnes of these books now, attended seminars on pick up, bought dvd's and even paid for private tuition so I don't consider myself a newbie at pick up anymore.The Layguide is certainly one of the better books out there on pick up. It's funny with some real laugh out loud moments.The one critique I could give this book is that if you're starting out in pick up then you're probably going to want something on actually approaching women or girls. Getting over your ""approach anxiety"" is the first step and should be taken care of before you try to become an expert! For this, the best book I've read by far isDestroy Approach Anxiety - Effortlessly Approach Women Without Fear. But after you get over your initial fear of actually approaching women then The Layguide is one of the books you should read to give you some more intermediate advice and tricks.Recommended!"
positive,"My niece liked it: Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Arrived when it was supposed to arrive. Overall, a very nice experience."
negative,"SUCKS!: ok..I will admit it I did like the song ""All the things shes said"" but the rest fo the cd isnt good at all...they sing about nothing! The only reason most people even like them is because there lesbians!"
positive,"This is a great cd!: This is a great cd if you loved the music in the game. It seems to cover songs from the begining of the game to the very end. It has ocarina songs, main themes, store songs and more. I've had the cd a week and I love it. Overall this is a great cd and I recomend this if you love the music in the game."
positive,A MUST SEE FOR EVERYBODY!!!!!!!!! (well almost everybody): This is a movie that everyone needs to see at least one time (anyone who can handle bizarre movies). This classic is the benchmark of all surrealistic movies. Outstanding performance!!
positive,"Fantastic case for small gear!: I have an assortment of usb and cardbus adapters with external antennas that I needed a small but durable case to keep them protected. Pelican makes good stuff and this model is no exception. The ability to customize the shape of the foam makes my gear have a nice tight, secure fit."
negative,"Poor quality illustrations: Do not give this book as a gift. It will disappoint. I am still looking for a high quality illustrated version of Great Expectations. However, I can vouch for the vendor who offered a low price and shipped promptly."
positive,"What is there to say, really ?: We bought this snappy little gadget to keep the family laptop powered for an upcoming trip. Recently took it on a test run with very good results. It plugged into the power port of our SUV, as designed. The laptop seemed to get a steady stream of power, with not a stutter in the DVD's performance. . The Xpower 175 features a blue LED when it is in operation and is both quiet & compact. Keeps our son entertained as the miles tick away. And when the trip is over, the Xpower, stows away in a carry pouch, perfect for storage in your laptop bag !"
negative,Dont buy: This video is not good. Peggy seems like a regular soccer mom who decided that she could make a yoga video. Her instructions arent good and her form is not good enough to be teaching others. The editing is pretty bad. And worst of all theres awesome surfing clips on when your head is bent over in your lap. How are you supposed to watch the sweet barrels?Maybe the other two Yoga for Surfers are better but I'm over it.
negative,"Depressing read.: The author narrated some amusing scenes (Subway platform sticks out in my mind) but overall it was a joyless read. She continually gripes about everything imaginable (job, mother's prying, lack of intimacy) but does nothing productive to initiate change, creates and maintains filthy surroundings, and is a perpetual job for her husband in her needs to be reinforced, picked up, coddled, and cleaned up after. What a bleak picture of what it means to be a woman living in 21st century New York. This book was a good reminder to myself to read the reviews before buying!"
negative,disappointed: i was really disappointed with this book. The other ones that she has wrote were very good but this one was dull. it was as if she rushed to put a new book out and didn't take the time to make it interesting. i would still read other books that she writes but i wouldn't read this one again.
positive,"Family-Friendly Hockey Fun: If you're looking for a good hockey movie that the kids can actually watch, this Disney vehicle starring Emilio Estevez is actually pretty decent. Estevez plays hotshot Minnesota lawyer and former youth hockey star Gordon Bombay, who gets popped for DUI and sentenced to community service. His assignment: Coach a hapless youth hockey team made up of misfits from the wrong side of the tracks. It's been called ""The Bad News Bears on skates,"" but The Mighty Ducks is a little too saccharine for the comparison. If you can get past that (and all the shameless tie-ins to the NHL franchise Disney once owned) there's some good hockey action and positive messages about sportsmanship, teamwork, believing in yourself and coming to grips with past mistakes. Especially in the final scenes, when the unheralded Ducks play for the league championship against their arch-rivals, the Hawks, a team led by Bombay's ruthless former coach. (Avoid the movie's two sequels, which don't measure up.)"
negative,"I DON'T AGREE: I bought both your book as well as Mental Models AS PER YOUR RECOMMENDATION AND REGRETTED THAT MORE.Yours is information vaguely spread along 560 pages and Indi's book is totally abstract, which I am still trying to understand. I would have appreciated if you could have cut all the fluff in 60 pages instead.GOD KNOWS how do you guys get all the five stars FROM"
negative,"Poor Streaming: Movie was great! The Amazon streaming was horrible. Several times the movie would stop to buffer but wouldn't restart on it's own. Several times we had back up and and restart the movie. Picture quality was good but streaming compared to NetFlix, Hulu etc. Amazon has a long ways to go before I'll buy another movie through your system."
positive,"Beautiful and sad: Sure the movie isn't in line with the books but if you consider it as a separate entity, it's really a beautiful story. The movie allows you to feel the emotions of war and a journey of love. It was frustrating at points, and I was a basket-case at other points, but over all it was an excellent film!"
negative,"Great movie, stunningly disappointing DVD release: I have no idea what they did to the soundtrack of this release - it is horrible! There is inappropriate background music that almost drowns out the dialog in some scenes. Most of the actual songs seem normal, but the mixing levels between the voices, sound effects, and ""ambiance"" music is way, way off.The color transfer also seems very shoddy in places - too dark in several scenes, such as at the outlaws' camp.Altogether, it is horribly disappointing to see such a wonderful movie treated in this way."
negative,"They have changed the design!: I'm a little peeved I been using Pampers Nany-Dry for 2 Years, unannounced the company that makes Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers has made a major design change to Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers (they seem more like Huggies) - much more elastic, narrower straps and much less absorbent material. It's hard to make it thru the night without a diaper change now!"
positive,"If you love the English language...: This is the largest, most thorough, most authoritative american dictionary available. It is a major publishing event when a new edition is released. If your idea of a delightful afternoon is browsing through a dictionary looking for previously unknown words, reading about their origins, and wondering about this amazing thing called the English language, this book will provide you with enough material to keep you happy for many years to come."
positive,"Enjoys it as longer as I can.: I remember that last time when I was teenager, I went to the theatre @ the mall. I remember seen as like that before. Finally I ordered ""A Bronx Tale"" on DVDs, They're a storying bout of theirs life in Little Italy town in N.Y. Island. They're all of Italian neighborhood, Bosses man who responbtiblies for treated of his own people who trusties 'em. He actually adopted w his son who spent time with his bosses. Excellent Movie. Thanks :)"
negative,"unhappy: don't buy this, broke out of the box,poor quality item, dissapointed child,worst present ever,stay away from this game not worth the time or money"
negative,"Unrealistic tale of young girl in WW2 Middle America: Book describes a situation so unlikely that that this should be categorized as science fiction. The writer badly misjudges trained soldiers and abused children. Although (mysteriously) this book appears year after year as a must-read for school kids, I think it should be relegated to the fluff fiction ranks of Sweet Valley High and The Hardy Boys. Characters are only developed in terms of their reactions to each other. No depth to father (just plain evil for no reason); no evident psychological damage to abused child (except hatred for father); soldier appears to be the least-trained soldier in the German army. It's just a badly composed story."
positive,"A Classic Must Have: We recently purchased this 2 disc Special Collection DVD. We love this movie and we are very glad to now own it. I think they did a good job with the ""Extras"" in the 2nd disc taking into consideration the age of the movie and all pieces collected for the Extras. We always like to see whatever they have that has happened behind the scenes while making the movie and how it all came about. The movie is a great classic of course and a winner. This is definitely a keeper for our collection and I highly recommend it."
positive,"When I first saw it in the theatre, I went right back!: I can't say I have ever laughed at anything so hard since. Neil Simon's parody of the 1930's and 1940's detective stories is superbly cast: Peter Falk plays Sam Spade, James Coco is Hercule Poirot, Peter Sellers is Charlie Chan, David Niven and Maggie Smith are reflections of Nick and Nora Charles. They're all summoned to Truman Capote's home to try and find out who is trying to kill them all. It's Simon intermixed with Clue and neither suffers for the blending. ENDORE! ENDORE!"
negative,"Don't buy this unless you want the complete set, it STINKS!: The movie really stinks. Only buy it if you're a collector and need it to complete your Halloween dvd set. Most horror movie fans consider this the worst horror sequel ever made. It isn't even about MICHAEL MYERS!"
positive,"Like looking in a mirror.: Mike Judge did his homework. As a computer programmer, I can say that this satire is right on the money!"
positive,"Map Books: We are a volunteer fire company with over 3000 streets in our first due. We use this binder for our map books in our apparatus. We have had great success with them and they hold up, firefighter proof as we would say."
positive,Oh the antics!: Danny Kaye does his typical antics throughout the film which is what makes it wonderful. The wordplay in this movie is really impressive and has some songs that will leave you tongue tied for days. The premise is an identity switch that leads to much confusion. Quite a fun movie!
negative,"If Ana loved it, I should too.: I didn't. This seemed so slow and plodding to me. I understand that this was a ""page turner"" when it was written. I understand that this is literature. I think it must be my instant gratification gene. I watched the movie. I am sure I missed tons of literary illuminations about character and plot, but I simply couldn't force myself to finish this book. This says more about me though than the author."
negative,"this should be titled ""An introduction to Jakarta projects"": If you are new to JSP/servlet development or want to know more about Struct or Log4J, this might be what you need. But for those who wanted to get in depth detail on Tomcat, forget it."
positive,"Good Stuff: I had the honor of previewing this book before it came out. It has great information. The little skits help bring home key points. Eva Rosenberg has a way of making even the most complicated tax information understandable. I think what I liked most is that she didn't offer any outrageous schemes to break the law undetected. Instead, Rosenberg gives readers the scoop on what deductions can be taken legally, how to stay clear of audits, and how to keep good records should you get audited."
positive,"Filters well and a good shower too: Installation was easy and the filter works well, keeping rust stains out of the tub. Also we have noticed a reduction in skin irritation relative to our old fixture, and our water does not smell as chlorinated."
positive,"Just like big chain stores: Ordered four shirts since I used them for work. Same shirts from the retail store; however mine weren't in OEM packaging. Don't really care, but it's actually less packaging to throw away :)"
negative,"Junk,Don't wast your money.: I got these in hope It would give me a good fit to my jawbone 2, but they did not work for me. I think they even made it less of a fit."
positive,Classic Thomas Hardy: Perhaps the greatest of the works by Thomas Hardy. It is the story of a tragic heroine whose life is shaped by events beyond her control.I purchased the book for a college class and hope to read more by the author.The descriptions of life in rural 19th century England are superb.
positive,"Great concept, really good film!!!: This film indeed deserves some sort of credit for originality and taking an idea plus putting a new twist on it. It's one of those underrated little gems of the 80's which I came to enjoy. The plot lacks a bit and the acting is pretty bland but the overall idea was awesome. Not very creepy but obscure enough to appease people who like a little mix of Sci-Fi and Horror. The soundtrack is really good also. Minimal electronic music with synths before it morphed into underground club music. If you're a fan of Halloween as a holiday, you may like this film for its seasonal appeal."
negative,"Ok: I think that the authors purpose for writing this was to send a message that there is evil in all men. I agree with him because the boys expressed it after they lost respect for eachother. They all showed some kind of evil on the island. The literary element that the author showed was symbolism. He handled it very well because it made you want to keep reading to see if his symbolism was true or not. In my opinion, this book was believable because imagine being on the for six to nine months. the boys went crazy thinking about how long they were going to survive which of course made the evil come out in them. The book was less than perfect in the ending. I probably would have had some cops investigate on why some of the boys that were dead looked the way they did. That would have been my way of changing the flaws."
positive,"Best of the series! Clear, easy signs & cute pictures: ""Get your spider-fingers ready...!"" (wiggle, wiggle)That's how storytime begins with this book, which will encourage active participation even in babies who aren't signing.Very cute pictures of babies and helpful captions for parents on the pictures of signs make this a series of books you will enjoy together again and again.The series is slightly inconsistent in that this is the only book to feature a lovely REVIEW of signs used on the back page (maybe they had an extra page because the song is short?). I find the review very helpful, and it gives the baby another sing-along opportunity she always loves!Recommended for ages 1-2 only, as it's a very basic song that older toddlers will probably not sit still for for long."
positive,"Does the job: I researched the internet and read all the Amazon reviews, and decided to add the Mr. Coffee warmer to my wishlist. My sister bought it for me and I've been using it for less than a week so far. I have to say that I think it preforms quite well. I have not tried putting a room temp or cold beverage on it yet, but will since it may just be strong enough. The less liquid in your mug, the hotter it gets and stays. The first time I used it, there was a melting or burning plastic smell, but this is to be expected and never occured again. This one does not come with a mug which I was dissapointed about, but my ""the Office"" mug works just fine. I might suggest using it with a mug that has a top or cover since this would maintain heat even better. The black color blends in with my desk and it's quite small as not to be an eye-sore. I'd reccommend this item, and it's saving me time and money since I'm not dumping cold coffee and buying more anymore."
positive,"The WinBack reveiw: Win back is perhaps the best shooting game ever to hit my life. It's a game that is so realistic with a awesome storyline.If they would to make a movie, it would probably be greater than Termenator 3. I mean think about this game. It's exciting, because your thinkin is one of my team mates goona die. And the leader of your team, actually works for the bad guys. Now That's a Classic. This is a must have. Trust me if you see it get it. Dont waste your time renting it."
negative,"Nice display but thats it!! Look Elsewhere: Got the 615C last June, '02. So far the latch for the cover has broken and won't stay attached. The stylus keeps slipping out - I've lost 2 already. The battery won't stay charged and the PDA orange light flickers when in the cradle. For the price, I should have looked at the Palm brand more closely. Had a IIIxe and was happy except for the display. The display on the Sony is the best out there, hence my purchase. But never again. For the price, the reliability is very poor after 6 months. By the way I have an aluminum case for the unit (after the factory cover broke), it's never been dropped or abused. Probably would have lasted a few hours with some abuse. No more Sony - it's Baloney."
negative,"Drive can't read CD-R/CD-RW's: I've had the drive for a few months now, and it worked fine during most of this time. But a couple weeks ago, the drive stopped working with CD-R's. It simply won't recognize the disc, and causes the entire computer to stall at times. It can still read regular CD's. Now I own a broken Sony mini-stero system (a gift), a broken Sony car CD changer (also a gift), and this broken Sony CD-R drive. I won't be fooled again into buying any more Sony junk."
negative,"DECEPTION!: Warning -- the two songs listed as ""Little Steve"" were written by him but are not the originals nor performed by him!"
positive,The hobbit: This was a great book I love the description and all of the characters it is defantly a dark and scary pg 13 book though
positive,"The Best...: Ok, peoples.... Mest is one of the greatest bands. I've been a fan of there since last October when I saw them in concert with Good Charlotte...with songs like ""Caddilac"" and ""Mothers Prayer"" what more could you ask for in a band. Great sound, awsome personalities!, and so far fans that would do anything for them. And they are rock'n without losing who they are, their roots. They know who they are, they know the sound they are, and wont change it for anything! The cd is one of the best Album's i got this year! The song are really catchy and you'll know all the words and backround music in about a day or two! This band... This CD kicks...Rawk ON!"
negative,"Just a few.: These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!"
negative,"Disappointed: I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and was disappointed when I got it. It said online that it was a 2-disc and I only got one disc. It wasn't in it's original packaging, and I payed as much for it as I would in a store."
negative,"Battery and screen suck: I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, because I wanted a simple phone that is light, tri-band, and with a decent battery (up to 2 weeks standby time nowadays is quite reasonable).The battery in standby didn't last more than 3 days, and if you turn off the phone to recharge the battery, the screen becomes totally dark: it is then impossible to know whether the phone is recharging, or whether it became fully charged, which I've never seen with the other Nokia phones!If these characterstics are generic, then get rid of it A.S.A.P.!!!!"
positive,Great book: J.R.R Tolkien does not disappoint in The Hobbit. I'm re-reading before it comes out on video since I haven't read the book in years and am still loving every minute of it.
negative,"british and boring: first of all, this is a book written by a british author for british women. i could understand most of the quips in the book, but not all of them.then all the advise. some good (and primitive), some not so good (unless you have the personality of joan rivers).i didn't like this book at all, but i thought i would give it a chance after reading the prequel."
positive,If you love Paula Abdul...: ...then you've got to get this tape! This sensational concert was filmed in Japan while on the Under My Spell Tour. It's exactly what you would expect from Paula! The dancing is awesome; the whole show is great. You'll want to watch this tape over and over again!
negative,"Didn't live up to expectations.: I ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole. Clark said they did not make this shoe anymore, so I had to order them through Amazon. Sadly, the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months. My son has since bought a similar pair from Sperry and they seem to be holding up much better."
negative,"Great story, no full color prints: I bought this book for my collection because it was advertised as containig ""twelve full color prints by Thomas Mackenzie"".Sadly, the Mackenzie prints are absent, they are, however, listed in the front of the book under ""illustrations"", complete with page numbers, just no wonderful Mackenzie prints.This is the ""River City Press 1978 reprint"""
negative,"DON'T LET THE TITLE OF THIS FILM MISLEAD YOU.......: If you are looking for the Audrey Hepburn Story, then this is most definately not the place. While the film is whimsical and pretty to look at, a documentary film or biography on the late actress would be far more capable of telling the story. The title role was horribly miscast, and while Ms. Hewitt tries very hard, she lacks the age, grace and wisdom to conquer such a role. I was very dissapointed in the picture, especially at the fact that they dedicated three hours to such a small portion of Audrey Hepburn's life and only ten seconds to her work with UNICEF (the best ten seconds of the film). While Hewitt fans are sure to enjoy her in a role that was very obviously tailored for her, I urge people in search of the ""real"" Audrey Hepburn to look elsewhere."
negative,Didn't care for it: This was one of those books I had a hard time getting into. It just didn't captivate my interest. I did read it to the end only because I was curious about Emma and how it would end. I remember very little of it and it is a long novel. It took me 5 months to finish it. I usually finish a book in a few days once I get started. Also it was written in an Old English style and some of it I did not understand.I would only recommend it to someone who likes the Old English writing style.
negative,"Needs Professional Editing: I'm new to telecom and I needed a comprehensive but easy to read book. This wasn't a good choice.The book does have a good glossary. However, after the first few pages the authors suddenly start tossing around acronyms as if everyone innately understands them.But worse by far is that paragraphs are out of sequence. You have to figure out for yourself that the paragraph you are reading is related to three paragraphs back but not the immediately preceding paragraphs. I found this very distracting and unpleasant and I really wished the authors had invested in editing services. You can piece together the logic but you have to be a pretty brave soul to take on a new, technical subject, a rather dry one at that, with a book that isn't strong on logical editorial flow.I wouldn't recommend this book except perhaps to someone already familiar enough with the material that the literary weaknesses don't hinder study."
negative,"APPALLING DVD despite great actors: I love Jeremy Brett and Piper Laurie. Their combined talents offer what few enjoyable moments there are to be found in this Macbeth, but they unfortunately can't salvage this atrocious production. Seeing it is enough to turn someone off Shakespeare. (Should that happen, Al Pacino's delightful LOOKING FOR RICHARD is the perfect antidote to restore passion for the Bard). But I digress. I want to issue a warning to all who might assume the DVD version of this Macbeth would be superior to the VHS. In this instance, tape was simply transferred unto disk with no remastering or enhancements, and there are no extra features. The visual and audio quality is appalling. I regret buying this DVD when I already owned the VHS (..like I said, I love Jeremy Brett...) The only advantage is being able to skip the boring parts to get to the monologues. But that isn't saying much."
positive,"I Recommend It: This CD is a complete compilation of all the songs from TLOZ: OOT. For the most part I like it, but it has some drawbacks. See, when Ocarina of Time first came out, I bought the soundtrack off of Nintendo, which only had 29 songs. Obviously, it hardly contains every song from the game, but the ones on this track are so much longer. Example: in my CD, Track Number 25, Gerudo Valley, runs through the 'verses' twice and then concludes, whereas on this CD, it only runs through once. Acually, it does that for most of the tracks. Zora's Domain on this CD is only about a minute and a half, while mine is longer. I recommend this CD to anyone who is a devout Legend of Zelda fan. It has everything on it, I was thrilled (I especially liked the Temple tracks). They arranged it well, though I think one of the tracks is repeated somewhere. Anyway, I think it's worth the money. GO FOR IT!!!"
negative,"only works with straight top tubes: great looking rack. folds up small enough to keep in the trunk.HOWEVER, it only works well for straight top tubes and pretty much eliminates anything except road bikes. top tube adapters do not work well with this rack.Does not work well with over-sized tubed bikes. Large tubes simply do not fit into the slots."
positive,Excellent: I ordered this video for my granddaughter. It came in perfect condition and on time. I am very pleased with Amazon.
negative,Oh my...: Quite old and outdated. Had to laugh at some things in this book. Please go with a newer version from this century:-)
negative,"The cheesiest movie of 2002: XXX was horrible! I didn't expect TOO much from Vin Diesel in the first place, but he was even WORSE than I had expected. This movie had a pathetic plot, stupid dialogue, and the most far-out fake action sequences I've seen in years. I do not understand what the hype is about XXX. The main reason why I kept watching was to see more of Samuel L. Jackson, but even his role wasn't worth my time, and I LOVE Samuel L. Jackson. If you just have to see it because of him, let me give you a word of advice: Fastforward to the Jackson scenes. I was blown away at the stupidity of this movie. I can't believe I sat through it. Poor acting, poor directing, and poor dialogue left me so glad to see credits! This probably isn't a movie for young kids anyway. It's PG-13 rating reflects violence, language, and a scene with sexual dancing. Don't see XXX. It's a waste of time and money."
positive,"A Rising Star: You know that an artist is popular when he garners so many reviews from so many people that love and hate him but this guy is a rising star!It took a lot of guts to get up in front of a panel of judges to audition for American Idol and then even more guts to sing in front of Simon and the rest of America!This album contains songs from different genres of popular music so there's something for everyone. I personally love them all! Give it a chance. I'm sure that you will NOT be disappointed.We gave Clay a chance and look where he is now!And for those of you who keep saying that he's ugly, take a good look at yourself in the mirror and see what's inside."
positive,"BEYOND EXCELLENCE: I am shocked to see that people write such wonderful reviews about Donald Lawrence but I don't see any about Bible Stories, which is without a doubt one of the BEST Gospel CD's EVER. I can't even single out songs... because they are all wonderful, you know what... I think I will single out a few! ""Message for the Saints"" and ""Didn't It Rain"" are just AMAZING tracks. I mean, amazing amazing amazing.... if you missed this album you are missing out on True and Filling food for the soul. This has got to be apart of any Gospel fans collection. I can't say enough about it... the first song I heard by Donald Lawrence was ""Message for the Saints"" and I was amazed at the character of the song, what I mean by that is... that blending of different sounds and octaves it was just a really uplifting song and it still has the same power today as it did back then. All I have to say is, if you don't have this cd GET IT GET IT GET IT GET IT GET IT. If you do, enjoy it!"
positive,"Warning: This book will change your life!: What best review can I give for a book that just changed my whole life? I think the best I can do is to honestly warn other readers about this power: ""Watch out! This book will change your life!"" But this will only happen if you read it honestly, with a true desire to acknowledge the title: ""Our Father Abraham"". Dr. Marvin Wilson, simply and powerfully, explains what Christians have lost since departing from the Jews. And, of course, what Jews might benefit from the Christian experience. Have you ever watched ""A Fiddler on The Roof""? Well, I hadn't, until I read this book. Now it's one of my favorite movies, because I know what's behind it! In short, if you really want to understand the Hebraic roots of your faith, don't start anywhere else. Buy it right now! And recommend it to as many of your dears as possible. But warn them: ""Watch out! This book will change your life!"""
positive,"A Magnificent Children's Book: A wonderful story about a boy and his father and their adventures in farawayland. A bed time reading classic every child will treasure. Very hard to find, but a must for any library as children will love this book even when they grow up - I know I do. Also highly recommended by Astrid Lindgren is The Brothers Lionheart."
positive,Awesome: Just an amazing item and would recommend this to anyone and the service was great as can be! Just awesome!
negative,"Dragged on too long: The book is almost 500 pages and it took about 250 to get to the intersting parts. The character development is incredible but the whole time you're like ""well, when are they gonna be connected?"" I previously read ""Rage of Angels"" by Sheldon and enjoyed that a thousand times more. I was a disgusted by Larry and especially Noelle. Adultury is a SIN!!!!!!!! I was disappointed to see Sheldon make it seem like it was no big deal. Not everyone has affairs and it is not normal. His book makes you believe it's OK to Sc**w the world. He's a great writer but I don't recommend this one."
positive,"At Long Last Amazon... my Fave ""As Seen On TV"" product !!!: Hey, Kids!!! Get your very own core sample, as seen in the opening credits of 'The Simpsons' !!! Mmmm... Uranium.The infomercial features none other than Billy Mays, continual winner of the ""World's Most Obnoxious TV Pitchman"" award for over a decade now. Hopefully Billy will have a 'mishap' during the taping and drop the sample down his pants."
negative,"After two weeks experienced no benefits: Saw this product advertised as a useful weightloss aid, supported by a report on the Dr Oz TV show. However, after two weeks of using this product, I found no benefit whatsoever. I will continue until the capsules have all been taken, although I think it's just another scam in the mega-million dollar 'weightloss' industry. I would suggest you do not waste your money on this product (although it was inexpensive)."
negative,Not so much: Product is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship. And then instead of sending next day to compensate they sent it regular mail so it took another week to receive. Not too happy with their customer service.
positive,"Wow!: All and all this is a very nice product. It really holds in those unwanted mid life bulges and it looks smooth under your clothing. It sort of helps your posture when sitting at a computer for very long hours. The inner cotton lining feels nice against the skin and it appears to move moisture,although not totally, away from your skin. Now mind you it is pure rubber, yes I said rubber, so make sure you wash it thoroughly, also it will take two days to air dry.I brought one with straps and bought the strapless one from Amazon......much cheaper than a boutique.Cher!"
negative,"trying hard but fail to impress: If you want to watch this, the better option is to rent it. It has nothing to do with the original. It stands on its own. Between the coke-takings and the iguanas and the alligators, there's not enough punch to make this film emerges as a great film to be bought and re-watch again in my book. There were a lot of potentials, but the director takes the easy way out with an already thin plot. Nicholas Cage was ok, too bad Fairuza Balk had only 2 scenes. Eva Mendes and Val Kilmer's talents were wasted. Just everage to such a promising start of a might-be-an-awesome film. Just ok, but not memorable at all."
negative,"Thanks a lot: I can truly say that my CD player saved my life. For a short while I regretted I couldn't at least listen to it, but I now realize my self-sacrificing CD player had better judgement than I do.For the record, I live a cardboard box. My only possesion was my CD player. I invested my begging money in this CD, I put all my faith in this little disc to keep me happy and to keep me going. So what happened?I'll tell you what happened.I put this hard-earned CD into my precious CD player, and you know what happened? The CD player's tiny crummy LCD screen started flashing obscenities at me, and then it exploded, melting plastic and battery acid all over, and ultimately burning my box to the ground."
negative,"the worst toy ever!: This toy took forever to put together and it fell apart with theslightest movement (how can a child play with a toy like this?). To the parents out there that are thinking of purchasing this toy, all I have to say is if you value your SANITY, you will run,run fast away from the toy store!"
positive,The last juror: He's still the best! Grisham has it down pat as a fascinating lawyer and story tell. Read all his books.
negative,"This isn't what you are looking for...: Sadly when a guide book isn't updated on a regular basis, it is no longer important. Such is the case with this fine book. I've got 5+ guide books on the topic and the only one worth buying is Fergusons. Good luck..."
negative,"Nice camera, when it works: I love the features and optics of this camera. I love everything about it, except that it really doesn't work and their service is terrible. Many people posted about the humming sound -- I didn't have that problem. But the electrical system was intermittent from the time I got the camera. I've sent it to them three times, and each time they repair it, or claim to. Now it is out of warranty and the battery still doesn't work. So I'll have to buy a new camera and hope that you don't make the same mistake I did -- go with a different camera."
positive,"100 Ways to Motivate Yourself: Change your life forever: From the first chapter, this book really drew me in and has given me so much encouragement and information. This guy is brilliant and doesn't over-word things until your bored. Very practical but extremely insightful and helpful. I'm ordering another one for my sister. This is a must read. Thank you Steve Chandler."
positive,"Whoa: I think this movie is heartbreaking, but amazing. I saw this a long time ago, and I recently went Best Buy and bought it, and I watched it again, thinking this is about four times worse then the movie ""thirteen"" in terms of kids getting in trouble. I love how it shows the downside to having sex - most shows and movies just have the characters go all out, like on ""Friends"" and not have any consequences. I think it's good that they show someone with HIV and Telly probably has it too. I think it sucks though that Jenny couldn't tell him in time, or Casper wouldn't have wanted to rape her then, if he had known. I really think that you should buy it, watch, but don't let your kids watch it unless they're headed down the wrong path."
negative,"Incredibly difficult to get through...: I used this book for an Organizational Behavior graduate course. The overall topic is very interesting, however, the book is incredibly hard to get through. It seems that all of the long drawn out chapters could be cut down easily to a tenth of their size, while still conveying all the necessary information. I found myself spending several hours reading each of the chapters, only to find that the same information was just being regurgitated over and over again. And I had to read many of the sentences over and over until they made sense. Though such an interesting topic, it was difficult, time consuming, and frustrating to get through the whole book."
negative,"Not this one: I found this book annoying. It probably has some good points, and even some helpful points, but I was annoyed with the tone of voice of the author. Give parents some credit, for heaven's sake! I read a group of 10 books about teaching gifted children, and there are so many better choices that I would not recommend this one."
positive,"Best War Movie of All Time: This and saving private ryan are two of my favorite war movies of all time. Midway tells the story of, you guessed it, the battle of Midway. This movie is more along the lines of an entertaining documentary than really a movie, yet it still great. I dont know, maybe because this is the most interesting battle of the entire war in my opinion, but this is truly one of those movies you have to see if you enjoy war movies."
positive,"WEEDS: Great show, obviously you know that if your looking here at it, it came packed well and shipped fast buy it!"
positive,"Amazing: This book is a must read for women of all ages!! Full of valuable lessons, the best book I've read in a while!"
positive,"Depths & Texture for Kindred in the Far East: Definitely a fascinating entry for the WoD series, and in my mind, a candidate for its own 'line,' rather than just a supplement to V:tM's Western Kindred. Complex, yes -- but reflecting the complex patterns of history and society of the Far East and the philosophies animating these mysterious creatures. If you look at just dots and damage dice, indeed, it is easy to create formidable fighters from these creatures--but there are lots of other opportunities and paths to follow, if you're willing to open your mind to them. It's especially important to remember how crucial ""setting"" is to these creatures...just as a lone Ventrue stands little chance of surviving in the Middle Kingdoms, in the West, the Kuei-jin are still making inroads. On a sigular basis, the challenges the West presents should keep these powerful Kindred in check."
negative,"Amazon says 50 minutes: while in fact it is only 25, as specified on the DVD. I am OK with the price I paid for 50 minutes. NOT for 25. If Amazon gave the right specs I would not have bought it. Now I cannot even return it, cause returning anything from Croatia is too expensive. So I am stuck with most expensive per-minute DVD in my collection. And the fact that I overpaid it is gonna be buggin me, and I'm gonna feel cheated for a long long time. Bad business, Amazon. Bad business. PS someone wrote 20 min in their review, 5 weeks after I ordered. Bummer."
negative,Things you already know: This books repeats its self over and over and it's things we know as women I wouldn't recommend to anybody could have wrote this book I guess I bought if because of the title......
negative,DONT EVER BUY THIS SHIRT: The shirt is NOT at all of a good quality. It does not worth $6 at all. Its transparent also. Please save your money and buy a better quality shirt.
positive,"Jonestown: I ordered Jonestown PBS Home Video and had already seen the movie years ago. It was like watching the movie with him and the real people in it. Awesome job. And shipping was within days, worth the price. I would recommend this movie and buying it here!!!!!"
positive,One of the best: Anugama is one of the best with world music.He takes you places and brings you back with grace.
negative,"Don't Waste Your Money: There is nothing of any value in this book. It's only 200 pages long, yet more than 50 pages are devoted to the author telling you how great his system is. As it turns out, there is no system. It's just a guy telling you to be confident. He also talks about 3 different types of women but never goes into detail about how to recognize these types. Overall, a complete waste of time."
positive,"A very good follow up to a great previous effort: While it doesn't have the hooks of Songs for the Deaf or the riskiness of Rated R, the new brew from Homme and crew does what its supposed to - make my neck sore, my hands crampinto permanent devil horns and my neighbors call the cops. There are plenty of gems on this disk, contrary to a previous review, but some will sparkle more for the die-hard fans than the newly baptised. Lullabies to Paralyze will probably bring more followers into the fold and undoubtedly they will find even more inspiration in the previous gospels of the Queens but it will not convert them as quickly or as plentifuly as did Songs for the Deaf, which owes thanks in part to three great singles, two great videos, and a hell of a lot of coverage by the media surrounding Grohl's much hyped return to the stool. As for those of us that have been here for a while, the dark forces of the desert rock are strong in this one and shall feed the masses until the next serving."
positive,"Did the trick: Since you're not supposed to put sunscreen on babies under 6 months, I was very worried about bringing my 3month old to the beach for a weeks vacation. This tent really helped keep him sun & sand free. We kept the tent in the shade so we wouldn't get the reflective sun from the sand and water. He was very happy playing in it."
negative,"Slow reading...: This book was a required summer reading book. It seemed like it took me the entire summer to finish it. It took a very long time to get through it, and I was confused at many times during the novel. Not recommended unless you're up for a challenge."
positive,i dont know why those bastards rated 1 and 2: those damn bastards that rated this cd 2 should be burned. they dont know what they are talking about.....sdre is the best band ive heard. well ive only heard about them a few months ago but i love their songs a(space)lot
negative,"THIS GAME IS TERRABLE!: The race tracks and the half pipe and all the skate parks are immpossible. I am lucky if i get off one trick. Steering the little guy is a tuff job too. He just goes around in circles. The graphics are nothing special. The plot to the game is stupid, getting money is VERY hard, and finding good stores are tuff. If you are about to buy this game, tony hawk skateboarding is 20x better....think twice before making the mistake i made!"
negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK: JUNK, JUNK, JUNK. As another reported, AA batteries are too big and do NOT FIT into many devices correctly. 3rd or 4th time I used the charger it significantly overheated and I believe would have caused a fire. I threw the whole mess in the garbage where it belongs. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK OR ASSOCIATED CHARGIN DEVICES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,Huge fan: Great packing. Great movie. We love it so much. Thanks for the hard work put in to packing the time!
positive,"Works beautifully!: If you own a Yamaha receive that can accept this dock, I would highly recommend it. To be able to control my iPod with my remote on my 46"" Sony LCD is like a dream come true. Just plug it into the receiver and follow the simple steps in the manual and there it is. It also recharges the iPod. I don't own a video iPod, but you can even play back video through this dock! An amazing little addition!"
negative,Does not work with Xbox 360 HD DVD player: Disc will not work with the 360 hd dvd player. Returned the product and received a similar non-functioning disc.
negative,Arg.: I feel dumber after watching this film. I think it is one of the worst ever. I didn't want to spend my time watching a bunch of kids with speech impediments have sex like rabbits.
positive,"A Classic thriller with that Fabulous Forties feeling: This movie is a gem. Perfectly cast, superbly acted, it is a riveting double plot woven in and out of L.A of the 1940's and the 1990's.Love, passion, murder, reincarnation are all blended together in a thriller that is spellbinding in the fashion of Hitchcockian ""film noir"". Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson spark passion in past and present as Roman/Margaret - Mike/Grace. It is especially enjoyable to watch the enormously talented Mr. Branagh play a case-weary L.A. detective. Derek Jacobi also scores definitively in a supporting role laced with both charm and menace. This movie is absolutely a must for anyone who loves the vintage Hollywood romance-thrillers of the of the Forties. END"
negative,Too old: This item is so old you need a network adapter or a phone line to operate. Still having problems getting signal to watch tv.
negative,"Good sound, comfortable, Broken after 1 month.: I bought these after shopping around a bunch. I loved them and used them all the time. For a month that is.Today when I was taking them off the center of the plastic behind the neck part snapped in two. If you are going to make a product that gets flexed in normal use, it better stand up to it.Oh well, guess I will get some sony's, I had my last pair of them till the foam ear covers wore away."
positive,"Lord of The Wu Tang: Basically the story is about 2 swords, 1 contains (inside the sword) the instructions for the most powerful kung fu, the other contains instructions how to lead an army and become China's emperor.But on one knows this secret. Everyone thinks these are magical swords and would give their owners invicibility.So the fight begins for the 2 swords...This is story a bit confusing, purely because the original story is over 3000 (3 thousand pages) long.What makes it even more confusing is this story is a sequel to another 3000 pages Kung Fu story.So to try and compress 6000 pages to a couple of hours on DVD would confuse any viewer unless you already know the story !Anyway, this is the best Kung Fu story ever. It was first published on a HK news paper in the 1960s.Most Asian males should know this story !"
negative,avid reader: BORING. this book should have been a short story. i am shocked that people liked it so much.
positive,"Great !!! If I could rate more stars, I would !!!: It is obvious that the inspiration was turned up to 11 on these guys. It never let's up. The best rock album I've heard in a while. The RnR Hall of Fame should reserve a space now in the 2010's for the BCs."
positive,"satisfied: I have tried several different brands of diapers for my son, but Pampers are the best. They are thin yet keep him dry for a long time."
negative,"I ""All-In-Wonder"" What is wrong with the ATI software!!!: The card is good as a standard video card, for games, windows, etc. The problem is the ATI software that is provided and is required to run the TV and TV scheduler (record TV shows). The software is very buggy, and has not worked on my pc yet. The support from ATI is poor, and after 3 days has amounted to not much more than suggestions to download the newer software and reinstall, which has no helped. After each re-install a new crop of crashes comes up, and the scheduler NEVER works. Save your money, buy a non ""All-In-Wonder"""
positive,An interesting look at high powered business in Hong Kong: This is a long but very enjoyable story. It captures the plots and dangers of business and finance in Hong Kong in a way that makes it so the story never gets boring. Clavell has a knack for historical fiction and insight into Asian culture that few if any western authors seem to. Clavell's personal experiences as a prisoner of war in world war II form the basis for King Rat and perhaps help explain his fascination with Japan and Hong Kong. Shogun met with great success despite it also being a rather long novel and Noble House builds on this story several generations later with the same vibrant and multidimensional character development that makes this book a great read as well.
positive,Dr. Barnett's newest edition to a timeless classic: In a world often fraught with depression and emotional prisons...Dr. Edgar A. Barnett gives us this enlightened book to show us step by step the way that we can turn the key and free ourselves through the use of analytical hypnotherapy. The chapter on self hypnosis has taught me great relaxation skills. I have been a fan of this book for over 15 years and find it as relative today as it was when it was first published. This newest version comes with a wonderful new cover design and clean crisp text. Wonderfully written to be easily understood by both the student of hypnosis and the average reader. Well worth the asking price.
negative,Terrible: Typical Hollywood movie trying to push off moral values that the average american does not believe in. This movie is slow and does not even make much sense at all. Hopefully most people do not live like this and if they do they would be considered weird.Do not waste your time with this movie!
negative,"what went wrong... with this book: ""What Went Wrong With Enron' desrves some credit for trying to quickly explain the collapse of the company just six months after it declared bankruptcy. But the book does a poor job of explaining how Enron grew to be the world's biggest energy trader, also lacks in color on the main personalities such as Ken Lay and Andrew Fastow and on the corporate culture that allowed for accounting fraud."
negative,not as good as i thought: It took me quiet long to get into all of the three stories!! The last one from C.E. Murphy was probly the one that i liked most but i was a liitle dissapointed. It did not really meet my expectiations
positive,Simply magic: This album is definitely one of the most terrific ones in the jass history. The sound stucks in your brain and let you fly to an other dimension.Also the quality of this vinyl version is great.Enjoy.
negative,"Why did this win best picture?: It is a great action movie. Keyword there is action. Best picture is supposed to be a drama, and Gladiator is far from and excellent drama. In fact all the dramatic scenes were pretty bogus. I cant even believe people voted Gladiator the best-best picture of all time. Gladiator should never have won best picture. If action movies won at the oscars than why hasn't Arnold won an oscar. Arnold's action beats Ridley Scott's any day. Another epic by another Aussie is 6 thousand times better: Braveheart. William Wallace has chunks of guys like Maximus in his stool. Braveheart is far and away a better best picture candidate. In fact every other best picture winner is better than Gladiator, because Gladiator never should have won best picture."
positive,One of the best EVER: Gladiator is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I loved it from start to finish.
negative,"Horrible book: The concept of this book made it sound like a fun book to read.However, I couldn't get past the second or third chapter. It has to be one of the worst books I've ever read. The author is more interested in whining about her own life, uses profanity more than I prefer (especially in a book which is supposed to be about cooking), and frankly wasn't very interesting.Read My Life In France if you want to learn more about Julia. :)"
positive,"correct version: I was hesitant to buy gladiator on blu-ray because of the ongoing probability that you can get the old, unremastered version. I received my copy and I am happy to say that I have the remastered copy with the issues from the old version resolved. I believe amazon only ships the remastered version now and that the old copies have been phased out finally."
positive,"Artie Traum: Essential DADGAD for bebinners: very good dvd however, it really applies to folks who play at least a little guitar before jumping into ""open"" tuning. Regardless, if you just want to sing along in front of the campfire with your friends, you can learn a lot about simply strumming the guitar to get by."
negative,"Laminator Plus: I was really disappointed to find this pad is two seperate pieces; I assumed the mouse pad slid out, but it doesn't. It is wedged in the bottom; very inconvenient. I would not recommend it. The pad itself is fine, it does have a small loop of velcro on the rear to hold your AC cord, it catches on your clothes and I will probably cut it off."
positive,"From Potter's field, buried with no name: Christmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI. When Temple Gault, a cunning serial killer whose killing spree began in Richmond several years earlier, resurfaces in New York with the murder of a female transient left in frozen Central Park, Scarpetta jumps head first into the investigation. The identity of the homeless woman becomes top priority, and when it is discovered who she is, the investigation is spun into a radical new direction. Meanwhile, Gault has set his sights on Scarpetta herself...leading to one final, terrifying encounter in the fetid tunnels below the city.A fascinating book with wonderful characterization, grisly accuracy and a high-voltage, suspensful ending. The Scarpetta series is the best! When it comes to crime fiction, no one does it better than Cornwell."
negative,"WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!!: WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! Gary the Snail is the best character in the cartoon. He meows, grooooowls, meows-&-growls at the same time, and can say ''No''. He plays the violin, wears a two-tone pair of Italian brogues, and reads the paper. He is a towering intellect and is granted ZEROOO role in this so-called movie! This omission has angered Gary fanatics all over the world! Any SBSP movie without Gary is sacrilege! WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! WHERE IS GARY? I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!! I WANT GARY!!!"
negative,"One of the most overrated mystery classics: I had great difficulties through the years reading this book. After finally reading it from cover to cover, my opinion had not improved: its chief virtue is length (mercifully short). It is mostly boring and of interest chiefly to students of the famous Tower of London murders it ""analyzes"". This book owes its reputation chiefly to the rave review that the greatest of all mystery genre reviewers, the late Anthony Boucher, gave it. For once, I dissented greatly."
negative,"A very forgettable novel: I chose this book from three options to do a term paper on in college. The only reason that I selected it was because it was not Huckleberry Finn, which I had read twice in high school. This novel is torturously slow and uninteresting. The characters are as rich as saltines. Save your psyche, read only if you have insomnia."
negative,"Wait For A Remastered Blu-Ray: This is one of my favorite movies, and definitely my favorite of Terry Gilliam's. That is the reason I was very disappointed in this Blu Ray release that is nothing but a straight transfer from DVD at best with no extras whatsoever. Wait for a decent release. I would give it one star, but I actually love this movie and couldn't bring myself to do it...."
positive,"Sturdy, well made, CREAKY (But a GREAT workout!): I've got to parrot the other reviewers in saying that this small device is a well built solid machine! This is made of a heavy gauge square shaped tubular steel, very nicely welded and painted. The electronic ""computer"" works as described, and the ""steps"" are a heavy, slightly yielding plastic, not brittle at all. The hydraulic pistons attached to the underside of the ""steps"" DO in fact, get hot after an intense 30 min. aerobic workout. Also the darn thing does creak with every step, not a small noise either, but a noise that you can get used to with the t.v or radio on in the background. I will in the future try the WD-40 method described in other reviews and will report back with my results. But I can tell you for $58.43 delivered it's a real good deal."
positive,"For professionals only: If you work as a professional color laboratory tech or studio photographer, this book has definitive information about the characteristics of the multitude of available filters. The information is simply available no where else in this easy-to-reference format. Be cautioned that this book is not targeted at casual amateur photogs or those learning lab techniques."
positive,"ENJOYABLE BUT VERY PREDICTABLE!: I enjoyed the book, however, at times, I thought it was slow and very predictable. Sometimes it felt as if the author was dragging the storyline out to add length to the book. On the other hand, it was an easy enjoyable read."
negative,"Sorry: more like jazz than zen...: First, this is a very short cd: only forty minutes. Second, although the string instrument(koto)sounds pretty much Eheiji-like, the flute, definitely the dominant instrument on this cd, sounds more like New Orleans jazz than zen, which is quite disturbing, to say the least. The first piece ends quite abruptly, which is a disaster if you are meditating.I was thoroughly disappointed and it was hard to remain calm and centered thinking of the wasted money. It landed in the garbage can after just one try.How other people could write raving comments about this cd is a something of a koan to me.I recommend Sanctuary by Riley Lee, which is real Japanese and Zen and is 61:19 minutes long!"
positive,"RUN To The Video Store and Buy This: This has to be one of the finest foreign action films I have ever seen. Kudos to the Germans on making this a fast paced, edge of your seat fantasy-action, soon to be cult- classic masterpiece. It puts forth intruiging circumstances. What if you didn't miss the bus or what if you bought that lottery ticket? In this film Lola and her boyfriend get to play out three different outcomes to almost identical situations. The dubbing to English is annoying at first but you get used to it. It is slightly off emotion. This is a great addition to your DVD collection."
negative,"the movie rocks, BUT...: ... sometimes it's nice to see that, indeed sometimes we germans clearly get better editions of some movies than you americans do. and in this case, the german company E-M-S did a very cool 2-disc Special Edition of Perdita Durango (original title) with the original english soundtrack. so I'd recommend this edition to all you americans with region-free-players, 'cause THIS FILM ROCKS UNCUT!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"Where it all starts: I read The Hobbit when I was in High School, but I doubt that I had the cognitive ability to actually appreciate Tolkien and his amazing story. The Hobbit is a classic, a true gem in literature. The Hobbit was more amazing than I ever remembered and I loved revisiting this classic story."
positive,"Finally a CD with real music!!!!: Its about time Usher released another cd. This cd is great, but is missing a couple of tracks that were suppose to be on the original version of this album. Unfortunately since they got on to [a downloaded site], he delayed the cd and took those tracks off. If those tracks were still on, i'd give it 5 stars. But if you want a good R&B/Hip-hop album, that isn't like all the other so-called R&B today, then get this cd. ...."
positive,"Maceo Parker is the stuff!: Maceo Parker can freakin groove...I saw him live last year in Florida at an outdoor concert, rain pouring down, and everyone in the crowd plain funkin. He's comin back to Alachua Music Harvest again this year with his old partner, the man himself, big JB!!!"
negative,"A Person with a Disability Speaks Out: This book is AWFUL! First, the title is offensive. I'm in a wheelchair and I hate the term ""crippled"". It's demeaning and insensitive. I thought Max Lucado was supposed to be a compassionate Christian? By naming the book this title, it not only teaches a new generation another ""hateful"" term it promotes treating people different because of their abilities or lack thereof.Furthermore, I found this to have the message of ""pity the disabled"" not treat them as normal and productive parts of society, which many of us are. If you truly want to educate your children about differences DON'T buy this book. It's ""well meaning"" but inaccurate books like this one that further alienate those of us with disabilities and perpetuate ignorance and misunderstanding."
negative,"Amahl and the Night Visitors- DVD of the 1955 telecast: I love this opera and I want to use it for my English classes here in South Korea. I ordered the DVD of the historic 1955 telecast. Of course, I knew it was B & W. What I didn't know was the sound wasn't clear and many of the lyrics indistinguishable. Sometimes the music was too loud. The limitations of the stage, after viewing so many natural settings on TV of the past 60+ made many things stilted. I suppose that I should have expected these ""problems"". Nevertheless, I suggest that you re-master this production and give it the visual and audio clarity it deserves.Thank you!"
positive,"think of it as your buddy: A super overview of the subject, this book helps me check every so often to see if I'm covering all bases. I found the pages on making the web work for you to be especially useful. The book sits on my buddy shelf--books that bail me out when I have a question or issue."
positive,What a rush!: This is the first Clancy book I've read and even though I'm no military expert I found it perfectly readable and enjoyable. I just hope that Clancy's other books can produce like this one. A great read that is a real page-turner.
negative,"Warning to Parents: Toy Makes Rude Sounds: It is an intersting concept, however, when you play your iPod through the toy, when you play relatively quiet music, it will burp and fart, implying it is ""bored"".This is a drawback for parents needing to teach their children polite behavior.I found it obnoxious."
positive,"one of the best: Dune is a classic on so many levels. There's not much I can say that hasn't been said by other reveiwers, but I wanted a chance to throw my five stars in.If you haven't read this sci fi masterpiece, pick it up (or check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend) and give it a look. It will take you to another world, as the best fiction always does."
negative,TERRIBLE! Leaks!: This is the worst nighttime diaper we have used. They leak 100% of the time leaving our baby drenched in her own urine! Awful. :( I highly recommend Huggies Overnites-zero problem with leaks and a great fit.We will not attempt to use these again.
positive,Enjoyable: The movie was great my husband was really surprised that I found it. He loved Transformers as a kid. The movie arived faster then I expected and was in excelant condition. Thank you we were very satisfied with the prouduct.
negative,6 foot not 6 inches: Amazon sent wrong cable to me twice... the picture and description clearly show a six inch cable. Original order and replacement were wrong.
positive,"An excellent way to jump-start the screenwriting process: I had already written a couple of screenplays before I read this book. While I can't say I agree with everything in this book's approach, I can say that it helped me put ""pen to paper"" when I was ""stuck"" otherwise.There are a couple of weak points to the book. One is that King should have advised that the writers know something about supporting characters before starting to write the actual screenplay. Another is that she advocates a set pattern of writing when in reality such a formulaic method will not apply to all people.But, I still highly recommend this book as it was extremely helpful to me. I would just add a cautionary note to modify her method of writing to fit your own. Once you do that, you will become more prolific in your writing."
negative,"Switch a Ball: I've bought this product to save me the time and money and I ended up losing money.In the first few months the ball was changing fine and everything is good. Now it's rusted and the 2-5/16 well not come out. So I'm stuck with 1 ball, just like a normall hitch. I really took good care with it and I had a bag for it. I use to clean it everytime it rained on me while towing or if it got dirty. That still didn't help."
positive,"Hunting the Hard Way: Thia was a gift for my Husband, who loved the book. It arrived on the date we were told it would."
positive,"i really liked this album: icp for the most part has disappointed me in the past with the releases of abk,amb and Esham. but i have to say this album is up there with the Jeckel Brothers era."
positive,"wrist weights (one lb each): I'm very happy with this product, for me right now, they are perfect. The 4 rating is twofold however, one I can see how many people might not even be able to get a wrist in. I have small hands and had to struggle (but I like the snug fit), others probably couldn't even squeeze in. And also the material feels great, but looks a little dicey. The seams are already straining quite a bit with the struggling, I could easily see a rip in a few months of regular use. At 10 bucks though, I wouldn't mind an investment 3 times a year if need be. Anyway, great product, could be a tad bigger with sturdier material around the sides. But for right now, these are exactly what I was looking for to add to my cardio workouts."
negative,"Dull, Disjointed: Two hundred pages into the book, and I'm still waiting for a cogent theme to emerge. Poorly written, poorly documented, and thin...in other words, perfect fodder for a commercial movie."
positive,"Beautiful: I love piano music, and this is the ultimate. It's something that you can listen to not just at Christmastime. And ""Improvisation on a Theme adapted from Pachelbel's Canon in D Major"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. It's quite a long song and it just carries you away."
positive,"Great Product: These condoms fit great and are very durable. The sensitivity is unparalleled compared to other brands I have tried. Currently, I have experience no breakages or any packaging defects."
positive,"A love Story for all Nations: Teachers take note! This is a must read for all future leaders. Jim DeFede tells the reality of people coming together to be ""in the moment"" during a very difficult moment.Clergy, this is a must read for religious studies!This is a how to book for adults -- how to turn evil into good, how to step across politics, religion, take down the borders that separate us and take charge, how to work for peace.Parents, a family read! Young and old, children, women, men and animals, every one is counted and made to be accountable for making life go on!A fine gift book --Heart warming sincerity at its best!"
negative,"Ah man. Another ""Collector's Edition"".: Universal is going to release a crummy ""Collector's Edition"" DVD and then next year, a ULTIMATE EDITION. The film is probally really good. Just, I probally won't buy this DVD."
positive,"Acting like this is quite rare these days.: This is a good action movie with great acting which is why it gets 4 out of 5. I've heard about the famous car chase scene for years and until now finally seeing it i must say it is quite overrated. BUT it must of been spectacular back then. Gene Hackman does some excellent acting, of course, which is about the best thing about this movie, just him."
positive,"not that common: this CD is not all that bad. most of the tracks are not that hard(there are a few though). their lyrics are deep. they express their feeling about God without coming out and saying the word God a thousand times, which is something i like."
negative,"Very poor product: Don't waste your time, money, and effort on this product. I think I got maybe 15 blades of grass. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
positive,"I Like it, my ABS & BUNS are still burning: If you want a video that works your abs and buns, then here it is. I have done thousands of situps and leg lifts and ever other thing you can do for your abs, but Kick to get fit, kicked my abs and buns. I think the reason it worked so well was because we didn't do situps or traditional ab work. We did knees and kicks and uppercuts, which seemed to work areas of the abs that I have never worked before. Also, my buns felt like they were going to burn off from all the kicking and kneeing. I really liked this video and I am seeing the benefits, 19 pounds and 3 pants sizes in 4 weeks."
positive,"Warp Brothers 3X50 Black Plastic Sheeting: Purchase this to lay on ground before putting mulch down. Worked great, very heavy plastic, would purchase again. I see this lasting years under the mulch."
positive,"ZELDA!!!: Oh Yeah, this is it. The Legend of Zelda Original Soundtrack. Chalk full of all the classic songs, Like Zelda's Lullaby, Serende of Water, Potion shop. It has all those songs and more. It even has the sound effects for whenever you open a chest. For all Zelda fans or even those that like music this CD is definately a must have for any collection."
negative,"This book is not the best.: I bought this book and struggled through it to review for my certication exam, and I did alright, but I noticed a few instances where either through typographical or proofreading errors the book presented incorrect answers to its sample problems. I also felt that this book's section on calculation review was written to sell the calculations manual available from the same series. If you haven't done serious calculation work for some time, this is not the review for you. I use calculutions frequently as I work, and even so, these authors managed to make me question my ability. There are probably better review books available, but I was too cheap to buy another after spending $35 on this one."
negative,"THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!: This movie is bad! There is so much to say about why it is bad, I do not even know where to start. First, There is really no plot! NONE! The acting In this film is also awful! The script, Awful! Everything, awful!. I am so glad I rented this, and did not buy it without seeing it! I gave this movie 1 star, but it really doesn't even deserve that! This film only has one good thing going for it, an Early appearance by JENNIFER GARNER. I have been a fan of hers since the 1999 TV series TIME OF YOUR LIFE. This movie should have been a short film, a very short film, then maybe it would have been entertaining. It is not short, it seems to never end. This is by far THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! Don't even waste your time watching this..."
positive,"Final Stan Getz Live Performance: Since I have been a longtime afficinado of Stan Getz, and own many of his cd's, I decided to purchase this ""People Time"" 2cd set of Getz andKenny Barron. As it turns out, this is Stan Getz's last Live Cd performance, since he died several months later in 1991.The performance of both artists is very good, and it makes me appreciate the tenacious qualities of Stan Getz over his five decades of work.The service provided by the Seller was excellent and I would definitely utilize them again."
negative,"Hideously Awful!: Wow. I really didn't know they made movies this bad. While Lambert has been known to star in a few clunkers this one has to take the cake. The script is just the pits, the soundtrack is an incessant techno-type music that seems out of place, the setting is terribly unconvincing, and the actors (to the extent that they can act) are worse than just about anything I've ever seen.Avoid this film unless you are a connoisseur of bad movies. Otherwise, it'll subtract at least 5 points from your IQ."
positive,Midway collectors adition: I like this movie but I'm having a problem with it it stops two or three times thru out the movie and I have to push the play or skip button a couple times to get it going again other wise I'm happy with it.
positive,"Excellent Product: This has been really helpful for maintaining protein levels after my surgery. It really mixes well with sweet or savory foods. The only issue is that you can't get it too hot; if you want to add it to soup, you've got to let it cool a bit first."
negative,"too small!: Yes, they are super thin. However, we found them way too small. They were uncomfortable for my husband to wear and spoiled all the fun. Stay away from these if you consider yourself ""bigger."" We've read great reviews about these and were really dissapointed. So... two stars."
positive,Love it!: The frisbee arrived faster than I expected and it throws great. I bought it for an environmentally conscious friend and ultimate player and this was exactly what i wanted. It already has gotten lots of use. I would definitely order from this seller again.
positive,"Pretty Good: It's your basic boy meets girl, boys insane, boys tries to kill girl, and so on. But I really enjoyed this movie, Reese Witherspoon is a pretty good actor, and Marc Walhberg is a good psychopath. Watch this movie."
positive,"Freddy Invades the Real World!!!: After The Final Nightmare, Wes Craven is having nightmares again, so he decides to write a new script. Beacuse the Nightmare films have ended, the 'real' Freddy decides to come to our world. Wes Craven, Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon are some of Freddy's targets he tries to kill. He tries to get Heather's son, Dylan too. The real Freddy is a lot scarier and more evil than Robert Englund could ever portray! Heather decides to play Nancy one last time and kill Freddy...for good! If you love the Nightmare series, and a movie within a movie, you might like WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE!!!"
negative,"Hey Bob Hoskins...what do you think of Super Mario Bros.?: The following is excerpted from an actual interview with Bob Hoskins, star of Super Mario Bros.:Guardian: ""So, what's the worst job you've done?""Hoskins: ""Super Mario Bros.""Guardian: ""What has been your biggest disappointment?""Hoskins: ""Super Mario Bros.""Guardian: ""If you could edit your past, what would you change?""Hoskins: ""I wouldn't do Super Mario Bros.""Don't mince words, Bob...how did you REALLY feel about Super Mario Bros.?"
negative,"Think twice about buying this player !: I purchased this player last August and it worked fine for 4 months, even though I didn't play it much. My intent was to use it primarily on plane flights. Suddenly and for no reason, I was unable to easily insert the earphones into the player. With a little effort, I was finally able to insert the earphone, but could not get any sound.I contacted Sandisk and was very disappointed with their response. The player has a 1-year warranty but it's very apparent that Sandisk is attempting to discourage replacing defective products by making purchasers jump through hoops to test the product and prove it is defective rather than immediately fixing or replacing it. If the player won't work as advertised, why should I be inconvenienced as a result.In addition, a senior service person was supposed to contact me about the problem, but has not done so. I would never purchase a Sandisk product in the future -- too difficult to deal with if there's a warranty problem !"
positive,"Great Book for Tai Chi / Chi Kung Beginners!: If you're just getting started in Tai Chi and/or Chi Kung, or thinking about starting, then this is a book you REALLY want! It's absolutely full of information on the basics of Tai Chi and Chi Kung: where they come from, what's involved in practicing them, what they can do for you. An excellent companion book for your class in Tai Chi or Chi Kung. BE WARNED, however: you WILL NOT learn either of these effectively just from a book! Find yourself a competent instructor if you're seriously wanting to learn."
negative,"Of interest as a historical source: The ""History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science"" may be of significant history for a reader who is interested in 19th Century views on religion and science (and as such it certainly has great merit), but for a reader seeking genuine insight on the books topic it largely useless.The author, keeping with his time, follows an evolutionary vision of human thought, instantly discarding any thought of the ""primitives"" and seeing true value only in his ""enlightened"" mind-set. Perhaps even worse, there is more than a bit of religious propaganda that sneaks its way into the text, without the author ever denoting it as such. For example, the ancient Christian polemic of Bahira, the heretical monk, is repeated as historical fact with no indication that it is at best pure legend."
positive,Works well: This charger is just what I needed to replace my Apple charger and it costs a whole lot less. The only recommendation is that you make sure to plug it into a surge protector as there is no third-prong ground on it.
positive,"Excellent read - brilliant writing: Released in Europe as ""Nell"" (hardback) this is a riveting autobiography of of Nell McCafferty, a journalist and activist from Derry, Ireland who was prominent in both the civil rights struggle in the North of Ireland and the women's movement in the Republic. She was a writer for the Irish Times for years covering the justice system and won awards for her series on the Children's Court. It's a wonderful book... she has a warm, down-to-earth style, somewhat self-deprecating, often wry and witty. But what really caught me was the first person accounts of things like Bloody Sunday and the Contraceptive Train. I was living in Ireland during these years and remember well the controversy surrounding the idea of women working after marriage and having a say in their reproductive rights. Nell McCafferty is a woman of tremendous courage and personal honesty who bore witness to some of the most important events of 20th century history."
negative,"Review of this digital download, not of the material, merely the presentation and the first version downloaded but removed.: Ok, just where to begin. First this digital download version is a joke. Someone did not format correctly. Each line is either double or triple spaced, even if you change font. Why stop there? Why not put a word per page?I would like to return the digital download, but can not find a phone number to speak with someone. Or a mechanism to return it.1984 is a good read. Content is good, presentation, not so much."
negative,Are you kidding me???: Are you kidding me? Is this seriously a professional film?I can't think of a worse way to spend 2 hours of my life!
positive,VHS = 5 stars - DVD = 1 star: This 1991 concert is excellent with the best lineup since the original band (69-71) were all around and making great music. Warren Haynes makes for an excellent 2nd lead guitar with Dickey Betts and the band plays many of their classic tunes including extended versions of Elizabeth Reed and Jessica. don't buy the dvd as the editing is awful - but do get the vhs for all the uncut tunes.
positive,"overall a good book.: Props to Will Connelly. I found it real researchable, very good to find, and overall the book I must find. I love it. It gives tips on rehearsing, what studio to built or to use, what type'a of equipment you must use or have, I mean it gives everything out from chapter to chapter.It also includes bibliography and recommendations you must read and know about. Good information."
positive,"Strong Woman: 200-300 worddI really liked this book because of Hester. She was a protagonist who refused to obey by socety's rules. She is a role model for women who wish to be free. Sure, she made a mistake. But, don't we all? Adultery is not right, but we learn from mistakes.I really liked to read about the time period because it was so different from our own. It is hard to believe that Hawthorne was only a writer for his time period."
positive,this video shows marily manson at their best.: This video shows Marilyn Manson at their best. The sound quality and video quality are excellent. Pick it up if you like Marilyn and after you have watched it...You'll like them even more. END
positive,Great movie and great to own on DVD: I thought this movie was great and the best way to view all of the special effects and action (other than at the theater) is on DVD.
negative,"Alright, but could be better: I had to read this for honors freshman English, and now my AP English class is considering reading it again for whatever unGodly reason. In classical Dickens style, Chuck makes a good social commentary or stirs some good emotions, yet does it way too slowly. The plot speeds and dies down, goes somewhere sometimes and goes nowhere even faster more often, and brings up characters who have no real purpose. Dickens is accused of being ""wordy,"" and I see why: British authors were often paid by the word and length of their novels and short stories. No wonder so-called classics like ""Tale of Two Cities"" and ""Great Expectations"" is heaped in a drudgery of fluff."
positive,"Best Bang for your Dollar: I have used this for about 2 months now. A friend was so inpressed he bought one too. I take this everywhere I go. While waiting for the wife, I watch a movie in the Van. (Using the Van's speakers the sound is great.) My wife & I took a trip & she used it & loved it. (This after telling me ""I was wasting my money""). The picture is great! The battery lasted through 2 movies. You get everything you need to hook up to your TV or home theater. The remote is a credit card size gadget. It does alot. The size is perfect & feels solid. You can't go wrong with this unit..."
negative,"This book is bad: When I finished this book I was very depressed and somewhat angry. Most of the characters in this book remind me of the shooters at Littleton, CO. This book would probably disturb someone who had experienced violence at the hands of thier peers. Why are books like this on middle/high school reading lists? I thought we were trying to promote good values in school, not total disregard for life!"
positive,"I loved every minute of the cd: I feel that version 2.0 was one of the best cd's of the year. It should have won a grammy. as well as the first cd 2.0 delived great vocals,gutair and a good beat. there is no need to skip tracks because all of them are well tuned to the point of profection. 2.0 is a must for anyone that enjoys rock or alternative. 2.0 the bands second cd shows improvement from there first album which was also a great album."
negative,"Steady Price Increase: I've been buying Pampers Baby Dry on Amazon for many months. The price is being increased every month on the same product with the same quantity. Unacceptable. I love the diapers, but will most likely be buying from somewhere else from now on."
positive,"Among The Greatest Kung Fu Movies: I'm now a grandfather. But I've been watching kung fu movies ever since 1961, as a kid growing up in San Francisco Chinatown. This movie rates as one of my all time favorite kung fu movies, and I own about 100 or so.The print isn't very good. The subtitles are hard to read. The story is among the most complicated and convoluted, especially for the non Cantonese speaking. But who watches a kung fu movie for plots?What I really enjoyed about the movie is that it actually shows what the Chinese cinema could actually do. It has tremendous battle scenes. Despite the poor print quality, the movie has some fantastic visuals.The movie is not a documentary. The movie is not an ""imagined documentary."" A lot of things seem to come out of left field. But it's OK. It's a MOVIE!!Quite frankly, the movie plot could easily be translated into a Star Wars episode!"
negative,"You've got to be kidding: I have been an avid science fiction affectionado for 40 years. This was the worst written tale I have ever tried to get through. If you like your prose written at a third-graders intellectual level and with the insight of a redneck moonshiner, this is the book for you. Where did they find the readers for this audio book? Unbelievably inadequate."
negative,Too long and boring: It's too long and boring. I think this book is not suitable for Hong Kong students in primary six. It makes us sleep. There are a lot of difficult vocabulary words. I wish there were more pictures and easier vocabulary words. We shouldn't buy this book. It's more boring than the Bible. I prefer to play computer games.
positive,"This is a lot of fun: The adventures of Homer, Freddie and their friends are a lot of fun to read. You'll laugh when Dulcey Dooner, the town grouch, receives an inheritance from a relative who'd been an inventor and finds that it's far more than he or Centerburg bargain on. This is a great book for kids, including the ones in their 40s and 50s!"
negative,Online Pampers are poor in Quality: Pampers that I bought online are very poor quality than that are purchased from stores.Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Economy Pack Plus Size 4 192 Count-Jhansi
positive,"Childhood Memories: I read an article that said Franklin W. Dixon died thinking he was a failure. He was miserable and disappointed that he never wrote a best-selling novel. What he didn't realize is how important he was to boys that religiously read every Hardy Boys book. ""The Secret Panel"" is possibly Dixon's best story in the series. The Hardy Boys almost have a car accident with a mysterious man named John Meade and Joe finds a unique key with a weird symbol after he leaves. Later, they discover Mead owned a mansion in Bayport and he has been dead for five years. Things get even stranger when Chet Morton's beat up boat sinks for no apparent reason."
negative,"False Intimacy has false determinations about God & sex: This book was a complete turnoff. Instead of relating to scientific, psycological explanations of sexual addiction, the author blames everything on lack of closeness with God and not being saved by Jesus Christ. This author could use a good shrink. Take respondsibilty for your actions. Is God or the absense of him respondsible for everything. What a crank. Buy this book and go to seminary school. What a waste of time and money. Pure garbage. Now I need to buy another book to find out about my sexual addiction (psycologically) not spiritually."
positive,"I'm ready to begin watching the DVD!!: Batman Begins is my favorite movie of all time. I watched it 10 times in the theater and I am going to buy a big screen tv for the dvd. Every young man should watch this movie as it features an all star father figure cast of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and the immortal Liam Neeson. Watch as they mold an angry young man into a legend. Not to be overlooked is rising star Cillian Murphy as he plays the creepy Johnathan Crane/Scarecrow. After the disastrous Batman & Robin in 1997, this is the movie Batman fans have dreamed about for years."
negative,"Very disappointed: I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he is so disappointed that I didn't choose something of higher quality. I read all the reviews and thought it sounded like a good first mp3 player that he could use to work out. At first, I couldn't download his music onto it at all, which turned out to be a simple thing: there is a button on the side that locks the player, which is not mentioned in the enclosed guide. The headphones started to cut out within a day, and if you wiggle the wires it goes in and out. The control buttons are loose and move in different directions, sometimes getting caught under each other. After 2 uses, it quit, and only works randomly. I am returning the product and will go for a real ipod next time. (We also use itunes, and it has been a pain to transfer our music to another program.)"
positive,"Helps baby sleep, but also makes him smile.: My little boy, who is 15 months, loves this aquarium. The music is very soothing and helps him fall asleep. Just today I rocked him with the music playing and he was asleep within minutes.I know he also loves to play with the aquarium since I hear him playing with it in the morning and after he wakes for naps. Sometimes he'll want to be put in his crib just to play with it.We are having baby#2 soon, so I am definitely getting a second one so both kids have one in their room.I highly recommend this for any baby!!!"
positive,"Better now than 20 years ago: As a high school sophomore when Back to Egg came out, I remember that it was considered a ""wild rocker"" at the time (at least in my conservative rural high school). I listened to it back during that time and particulary liked the songs ""Getting Closer"" and ""Arrow Through Me"" (that latter was used in a Benji/Chevy Chase movie-seriously). But then came more serious McCartney works --the experimental McCartney II, the sublime Tug of War and quickly this album was pushed to the rear of my collection. In recent years, I have rediscovered it and now view it as McCartney's ""lost album."" Even Paul has dissed this album but the songs have a clarity and attitude that make more sense to me know 20 years down the road. Okay, I still don't know what the heck he means by ""I'm getting closer, my salamander"" but gee it sounds so good. This is a McCartney junk-food album, many people don't like to admit that they like it but it sure does sound good and what a voice!!!"
negative,"Nice House: Although billed as a ""comedy"" this movie doesn't contain a single laugh. I guess what they meant is a ""comedy of errors"" where unlikely-event-follows-unlikely-event to the point of compounded absurdity. The film doesn't feel like Frank Oz either, but more like a second- (or third-)rate BBC television programme. Characters enter hysterics, stereotypes are overplayed, and everyone talks in a stage whisper. I'm giving it two stars primarily for the gorgeous chateau in which it was filmed -- I want to live there.After I kick everyone out."
positive,"Zorba tells us what the life is !: I have just finshed reading Zorba the Greek yesterday. I was just like the boss who always just thinking and asking what the life is. So I could do nothing. But Zorba told me "" Do anything ! And then you may find out the answer"" I really recommand that you should meet Zorba.."
positive,Up From Slavery: This book is a must for todays generation and for those who feel in a minority. It is a great encouragement as to what a person or group of people can do if they set the mind to it and are willing to exert some effort. There have been times that my wife and I cleaned toilets for a living and we determined to do the best job we could. This book helps me to have another reason as to why we did that.
negative,"What a piece of junk!: Recently, I went and bought this CD Player, i was going to geta ... Sony one but ended up with this one instead cuz' it was cheap u know? Well, this one I bought didn't even have antiskip protection at all! It skips whenever I go and it eat batteries like crazy! I had wasted over 10 batteries within a month. What a piece of junk! I don't think this product differs either so I recommend not buying it and get a better product. In fact, I just going to get a new CD Player from KOSS which I think will be better. This is not worth your time, and the cd players ugly too!"
positive,"Great job TIVO !!: I was so thrilled when TIVO came out with this wireless adapter !! With cell phones increasingly replacing the need for a land line, TIVO hopped on the wagon. The only reason I had a land line was for my TIVO service. With the wireless adapter, I had my land line disconnected and am happy to save that monthly expense.Adapter works great and I've had no problems with it over the last 10 months or so since I purchased it.It was easy to get working !"
negative,not sufficient after a long day at the computer: I am a writer and have to work 8 hours straight at a keyboard for clients when on tight deadlines. It was suggested by a specialist that I ice my wrists every night. I thought this would be a neat way to do it. The concept is good but the beads never get cold enough to accomplish the therapy and subsequent relief needed.
positive,"Puerto Rican experience life in the New York City: I think that this book should be required for all Puerto Rican people who live in New York. This book talks about what it was like to grow up in New York in the 1940s and 1950s. I think that this book does a good job explaining the experiences of a family. Also it talks about what Piri Thomas does and what kind of problems he is involved with, like drugs, in gangs, and that's very similar of what is going on now. I think people who don't want to be in a real trouble should read this book. I enjoyed the when Piri Thomas was sleeping out of his house because I imaging what can happen to me if I do the same things. This is the best book for anyone who is interested in learning about what is like for a Puerto Rican family to live in New York City."
negative,sucks: It's not what you'd expect. Almost all signals around interfere with the video and audio of this camera. I takes too much adjusting every little move the camera makes so it is impossible to view off of a moving toy like a helicopter or RC vehicle as the product states plus RC products emit own signals than can cause video interruption. Not a good product at all. Will be more careful what cameras I buy next.
positive,"Why the '20's Roared: This disc contains a brief history of great music from the '20's interspersed with embarassing schlock that would make a mother wince. Most people will buy it, and justly so, to hear Bix; however, after listening, the discerning buyer will be happy that he has heard Steve Brown, a very under-rated musician, at his best. Frank Trambauer carries his friend Bix, either through direct inspiration or with wonderful counterpoint in several of the songs. Some of the cuts, like I Didn't Know, have been mastered through a string telephone. But carping about the sound when you're listening to history, or complaining that Chauncey Morehouse was only permitted one high-hat and a snare in the studio, and thus criticising his drumming seems tawdry.This is a great addition for both jazz neophyte and discerning collector of twenties memoribilia. But when you hear the ""restoration"" [sic], you will mourn again the passing of John Davies, who knew how to treat this sort of material."
positive,Wow is this real?: This book is absolutely a good book. I really enjoyed it. It draws you to it and you can't wait to find out whats next. I know there are men of God who are like this. But it does make you wonder why people do what they do when it comes to religion. I love it. Can't wait to read your other books.
negative,"Why did she bother?: I was a great fan of the Authors previous books. I found all of them imaginative and the detail very interesting. I have to admit that The Plains of Passage became a little tedious at times, but the story line made it worth the while.In this installment however, the detail was tediously boring. I found myself skipping pages to try and get back to the story. But the story was merely a recounting of the previously explained history of Ayla and her skills. The characters are even so similar to previous books characters that the encounters are repetetive. The story that this book tells is almost non- existent. The characters are one dimensional. It could have been told better in two hundred pages.In other words, it was a big disappointment, a well written yawn."
positive,"Maybe I identified too much! But I loved it!: Ok- I too am coming on 30 this year. I too love to cook. I too am a slob in the kitchen (and out). If you get through this book you'll see why I may have found myself enjoying it because I could identify with Julie Powell a bit; but it had great things to offer besides-things outside my realm. She does a great job laughing at herself and her predicaments and I enjoyed going along for ride. It is not ""great writing"" but it is worthy of reading and the story and laughs make up for it. Enjoy it over a weekend!"
negative,"hate this movie...: i don't like this movie at all. the plot is just dumb and really bad. the soundtrack is good though. i can't say that madonna is one of the best actress out there but she has a few, good decent films. if you're a fan, just skip this one."
negative,"!!!!!expired perfume!!!!!: I bought this 2 years or so ago, and I am STILL upset about it. it arrived and was a dark orange-ish color, and smelled rank and well just old. I would never ever buy from here again. I waited 15 years to have this fragrance because I could never afford it, only to be let down terribly. maybe they didnt know it was expired and had went bad..i dunno....in any case, bad bad experience."
positive,"A real treasure: My husband loves watching documentaries, but cannot sit down and read a book. Until this one! He read everyday, until he finished it, and has started reading it again, 2 months later. His dad was an Army veteran, but he would never talk about it."
positive,Nice Book: Very nice as advertised. Quick delivery. Dr Lumpkin was a professor of mine and I worked with his wife. This book is fairly rare but well written and a family favorite.
positive,"Shriekback's Organic - All Natural - High Bran Album: Shriekback's Barry Andrews is a genius of the highest order. This album has the band ditch all synthesizers (A bold move! Electronics being heretofore their main life-blood.) Andrews' garage sale of the sorts of machines worshiped by pale Englishmen with funny haircuts and their ilk frees him up to add yet another depth to the Shriekback sound. Attempts to express my enthusiasm for works of art like the contents on this CD are ineffable - at least on my part - but I do want to register my 5 stars, and hope that anybody who follows my other recommendations will try this great work of art as well. This is like eavesdropping on Shriekback in a world of no electricity. Thank God somebody was cranking a generator or some such device in order to record this work. AWESOME in the organic, original sense of the word. BUY! BUY! BUY!"
positive,"Misogyny or reality?: Feminist bloggers love to expound on how misogynist this story is, but crime happens, criminals victimize women, and if supercriminals existed they'd be victimizing the superheroes' women given half a chance. It's a good story. Don't miss it."
positive,Looks as good as new: If you haven't exprerience Kubrick you're missing on a substantial proportion of the world's most remarkable films
positive,"""A Best Buy!"": This version is a perfect reincarnation of this well loved musical. Julie Andrews' voice fits Ms. Anna perfectly. This album is a welcome change for Lea Salonga and Peabo Bryson in that Lea beautifully sings in a soprano voice and Peabo's versatility just shines. The dialogues are well spoken. The music and the ochestrations are much richer than any version I've heard. Can't miss on this one!"
positive,"Virtuoso female jazz vocal performance; a new superstar!: I had the once-in-a-lifetime experience of hearing Eve perform many years ago in a small club in Durham, NC, when I was a medical student at Duke. She must have been a young teenager at the time. I just wish I had been a record company executive, so I wouldn't have had to wait so long for this solo album! Many of the selections are jazz standards but arranged and interpreted in completely original ways. Eve is simply an incredible talent. Chip Crawford is also a superb pianist. I think I've listened to the ""Lush Life"" track at least a hundred times already!"
positive,"Just good to be back in King's world.: There is something about diving into a King novel that is like nothing else! I have read everything Mr. King has ever written, and for the most part, I love his writing, his sense of humor, his characterization. I was a little disappointed when I started this novel, like everyone else, I was anticipating another ""It"", or ""Stand"", but as I got into it(200 pgs. or so), I found that I was coming to know the characters, and getting involved in their lives. I love the King-isms of all his books and I just enjoyed being with him again through another story. True fans of King will like this book for that reason only. Anyone who hasn't read King, should not start with this novel; this is for true King lovers only."
positive,"I love it!: I love this movie!To see Jerry in a dress is always funny.Skinny and hairy!What a riot!!!He's a very handsome man,but he makes a funny looking laaaaaadddddyyyyyy!!!It's worth watching."
positive,Good For The Kids: This book was written for kids who enjoyed the remake of Planet of the Apes. Grown-ups will probably not enjoy it but it was not intended for grown-ups. The book is a nice effort for the kids. The mediocre script for the movie did not leave the author of the book with much to work with. It is nice to see that a new generation of Apes has begun and I welcome the effort of the author.
negative,"Horrible: My 4 year old hates this toy. Not only does it pinch when it snaps shut, but the same tooth triggers the snap every time. It didn't take him long to figure out which tooth NOT to pick. This toy was a huge disappointment this Christmas."
negative,"Lord of the Flies: I was not a fan of this book because i couldn't get into the story line. I read it simply for school, not pleasure"
negative,"""Edgy"" for the sake of edgy: I get that pay cable shows can show whatever they want, but with ""shameless"" they're just doing it because they can. It's a COMPLETELY inaccurate portrayal of 95% of the residents of the south side of Chicago and they commonly mistake normal Chicago landmarks. It seems as if it's a show made by people from California who have no clue about what Chicago is like.p.s. I call bulls***on ANY girl who looks like Emmy Rossum shoveling s***for a living. It just doesn't happen. I don't care how poor they supposedly are."
negative,"So Disappointing!: I was so excited to try this item when I ordered it, but when I got it I was so disappointed because it didn't work. It didn't even turn on! I didn't try to return it because I was under the impression it is a nonreturnable item. I won't order this product again but will try ordering from Amazon again."
negative,"Color does matter: Like the others, I will not buy this item unless I can chose the color. Of course the color matters. The company must not understand that customers like choices."
positive,Review: A brilliant piece of work. The genius use of foreshadowing definitely keeps the reader wanting more. It is definitely a greAt novel.
positive,"Love It, but...: This amp plays crisp and clear, but i was a little disappointed in the power. I should have known better 50wpc. Still sounds great. I'll just turn it up a litle higher."
negative,"This way to the egress.....: When P.T. Barnum wanted people to leave the circus he put up a sign: ""This way to the egress."" People thought the ""egress"" was an animal instead of an exit. I suppose today some of those same kind of gullible people think Casteneda's books are fact instead of fiction...it's a shame how he ran a 30-year con on the naive. Sometimes, I suppose, even the stupid. I'll bet he laughed all the way to the bank."
positive,"don't waste time w/t chopped up versions usually shown on TV: This is a wonderful movie. The chopped up versions usually shown on TV are pretty good, but the real thing is like a completely different movie. The parts cut out are key to both plot and character development. Maybe the best example is Madonna's role, which is far more nuanced [and likeable] than the flat one in the usual TV version. Next would be ""Dottie's"" leaving the team, which makes far more sense in the original movie.Buy it. You'll love it."
positive,"Best Office Comedy Out There, Instant Classic: There is not a workplace in the world that one can walk into and not find somthing that parallels this something in this movie. This was Mike Judge's live action directoral debut, and he hit this out of the ballpark. Known for bevis and butt head and King of the Hill, Judge placed together and excellent cast to bring out the best humor that many of us can relate to in a close quareters office based setting. From the Fax Machine to the Memo's, to The overall dissatisfaction and unfulfillinness of the job. The there is Milton...just an awsome character. Laugh until it hurts. Buy this movie, you will watch it over and over, worth the investment"
positive,"Excellent boot: This is the boot I've been buying for general purpose for 10 years. An excellent boot - wide enough for my wide feet - fit well right out of the box - leather is tough enough to last many years and out sole is very close to being a 'mountain' out sole. Good support, good shank, good cushion. this my boot of choice of work and light hiking."
positive,"Funny pacifier!: This was a gift to my boss for her 6 month old son. She commented on the packaging and quality of the pacifier. It's not cheap or thin plastic. The way the part that goes into the mouth is shaped she says was just like the expensive ones, a comfortable fit for him. She totally approved- and that's hard because she's a fist time mom and rightfully picky about what her baby has. Needless to say....that photo of him using it was hilarious! Her and the hubby get a kick out of it."
positive,"Not too shabby: I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. We used it outside for the summer and it's great. I would suggest keeping it inside as the outdoor elements warped it after 3 or 4 months--and also the sun faded it quite a bit. It was pretty sturdy until the wind and rain got to it. I think if you plan on keeping it outside, consider it disposable after one season. If you keep it in the house, it would last a long time. Great fun and a great deal for the money! And as an adult, I DID fit into it with her!"
positive,Good chick flick: I purchased this for my teenage niece and she really liked it. She said she would watch it a second time so I think it must be really good.
positive,"An instant classic!: Peggy Sue Got Married starring Kathleen Turner is a film I absolutely loved as a young girl. Turner is flawless and so vulnerable as the title character, no one else could have pulled off such a real and touching performance. Nicholas Cage is superb as well, his voice is so funny in this one, you have to hear to believe it. This sweet romantic drama was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and look for his real-life daughter Sofia Coppola as Turner's younger sister. This film is a must-have, you will enjoy it."
negative,"Can see it: Every time I try to watch this movie on Amazon Prime I get audio, but no video either on my TV via a Roku box or on my computer. For the life of me I can't find anywhere on the Amazon site to report this problem to anyone. Do you think anyone from Amazon reads these reviews and can help."
negative,"Disappointed: My 7 year old son with special needs is very interested in anything related to dentistry (books about going to the dentist, the books Open Wide and Dr. DeSoto, ...) so we were really hoping this toy would get his attention too. However, it is just not very entertaining and it is also very fragile. The teeth would get stuck from the first day we opened it and after dropping it a couple of times, it broke apart, so we are no longer able to use it anyway.Unfortunately, this toy was a dud at our home."
negative,"NOT THE GREATEST!: No wonder there are so many unhappy men in America...that attitude from a woman did not fly with me. A friend of mine had it and I wanted to check it out. She is definitely a bitch in many ways, but not like in the book."
negative,"Boring: Unfortunately I received this book for Mother's Day and feel obligated to read it from cover to cover. Under normal circumstances I'd chuck a book this boring into the can and pick up something more stimulating. I'm on page 310 (it's taken me 4 weeks to get this far) and wish I was on page 749 so I could put this thing on the shelf to gather dust. When my family asks if I'm enjoying my book I cross my fingers and repy, oh yes, thank you very much."
positive,"A great book to jump start your imagination.: This book means a lot to me, it was one of the first I can remember reading. This book sent me off on a life long pursiut of fantasy and sci-fi reading material. This book ranks in the top ten of the hundreds of books I have read. Diane has spun a tale that completely spellbound me into a world of magic. Best of all the characters were completely realistic, and were people I could relate to in my own life. In the end I was almost convinced that magic could happen."
positive,"Gritty and Awe-Inspiring Album: Pearl Jam does it again! Everytime these five get together, a mystical magic fills the air. This time you can't but help listen with both ears as the eclectic (and I do mean eclectic) and electric sounds embrace the deepest part of your soul. Wonderful lyrics and musical accompaniment proves that Pearl Jam is here to stay. They have evolved and come up with a different sound everytime. This time around proves that they are essential artists. Great job!"
positive,"Excellent Diaper: This is a fantastic diaper. It can do what it says-- stand up to a 12 hours of peeing overnight. It handles big bowel movements well. It's never leaked. My baby has not had any kind of reaction to the diaper. The only reason I give this diaper 4 stars is because Luvs does the same thing for much cheaper-- in this case about $15 cheaper for the same amount of diapers. Luvs does have a powder sent which I would not prefer if money were no object, however it's not too strong and is worth it to save that amount of money per box."
positive,Great Documentary!: This is by far the best documentation of the Peoples Temple and the JonesTown tragedy!
negative,Great idea...bad support: I bought the Sony E-Marker because I thought it was a great idea. I am the type of person who does not remember who sings what and the title of songs. I was estatic when I received it in the mail and could not wait to start using it. To my disappointment when I went to download the driver I found out that it is only compatiable to Windows 98. I am currently running Windows ME. I tried to contact emarker for support with no luck or response. I have no idea when an update will come out so basically I have a product that I would love to use just sitting on my desk taking up space.
negative,"stupid shipping: good price, but stupid shippingthey couldn't deliver this item, and the order returned.they refunded only part of money and i paid and i lost all saved money of online order because of this unexpected returnyou should be careful when ordering something online"
negative,"Not worth the money!: Not worth the money do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more on a better built cabinet. It was difficult to put together and broke the first time it was opened, it's just very flimsy and poorly made. I would not recommend buying this shoe storage cabinet to anyone. Stay Away!!"
positive,"A book that will become your world...: A avid fan of Science Fiction. I started reading the series when I was only ten years old. It changed my life. It taught me a new way of experiencing the world, a new way of living. I'm nineteen now, and this series is still the deepest most meaningful written work I've ever come across. Dune is a piece for everyone. But please, read ALL the books. Too many times I've heard people complain afer reading only the first. It's like using only one of your senses and then deciding that life's not worth living. Read them all, and let them combine to become the greatest work of all time."
negative,batman begins: when i ordered this product i looked at the picture of the case and when i recieved the blu ray it was in spainish and english which is fine if you show the same picture of the blu ray recieve and not like me which is falsly advertised.
negative,"Can I give it a lower rating?: [...]These brewers only seem to last for maybe a year or so....I've gone through four of them and now the fourth one is having problems. I will NOT buy another one.Shame on me for giving Green Mountain (yes they are the ones behind Keurig) my money.I bought my first one from amazon which was replaced by keurig, when that one failed they wouldn't replace it but I had 8 boxes of kcups (at $9/box - you do the math) - i bought another one from another retailer - that failed after 10 months, yes they replaced it and now that one is having problems again...save your money buy a starbucks gift card or a french press."
negative,"Excuse me??!: Excuse me, Alexandrea Marie Anna Bunitorsua, are you STUPID(I think you are) you want to have children at 15 yrs old? what are you, a rebel? Oh, and girls CAN participate in sports. You're lust chicken to try it out. Ohh. talk like that again. girls can participate in school. your just dumb enough to know that!- Rovi, a BRATZ collecter"
negative,Von Richtofen & Brown: This movie was so full of incorrect facts that we just shut it off and decided that the money spent on it was a total waste as was the time spent watching it. Just a little research would have made a half way credible movie instead of a complete farce.
positive,"NItty Gritty-This book gets to it...: Nappy... this book gets down to the nitty gritty. Venus and Kandi are so real. I could see myself in both characters. I think many black women are like Venus, independent, take charge, and wish or have tried (as I have) cutting their hair off. Kandi, on the other hand, is what we have to at least appear to be to black men so that we are considered attractive- long hair, sexy, somewhat dependent, emotionally needy, and not intimidating. If you want to read a book that is not only pleasurable to read, but infused with a realistic look at the lives of young black women then I think you will enjoy this one."
positive,"Greenfingers: What a brilliant movie, and to think that it was based on a true story. If you are a Clive Owen, Helen Mirren or a David Kelly (Waking Ned Devine and Fawlty Towers) then this is a movie for you."
positive,"favorite classic: loved it in high school, love it as an adult...Great book and very informative.Book is written well with ability to keep the reader interested in the book and all it has too offer.Characters and other plot."
positive,"Best and Most Realistic Horror Film of the Year!: The entire family had a wonderful evening wathing ""The Haunting"" tonight. The scarriest part about it is that it is so realistic. You feel like you know the people and that you are there in the house with them! One of the best parts is the Special ""Behind the Scenes"" portion on the DVD. We really enjoyed this part of ""The Mummy"" but this was even better. A movie in itself! A good movie for a cold winter night (the kids will certainly join you on the couch!)"
negative,"dissapointing...: As an avowed fan of the paranormal, I found ""Investigating the Afterlife"" a bit dull and predictable. Not much different from what is shown on TV's documentaries of the paranormal. Mysterious noises, footsteps, doors that open or close on their own, unexplained lights and shadows showing up in pictures, etc., etc. For me, the DVD did not show anything new of what is already being featured on this documentaries. Admittedly a waste of money."
negative,"To put it more succinctly.....: There is nothing innovative in this book. What was innovative of Tolkien, LeGuin, and Mcaffrey has been regurgitated in Eragon. It is remarkably well done for a teenager's mimicry of greater works, but will remain just that. Mimicry. Two stars instead of one because it was readable."
positive,"Good but needs some more explanation: I have been reading this book for a couple of weeks and have found it very helpful in my journey towards understanding Java Development. There are lots of examples and the book is generally very readable.I do have a critiscism though. The book in some area's could have done with a little bit more detail in its description of some of the tasks provided by ANT. For example in it's covering of the <apply> task the use of the <mapper>, <srcfile/> and <targetfile/> tasks within the context of the <apply> task was only 2 sentences. Although the authors had covered <mapper> in a previous chapter they could have discussed them a little bit more in the context of thier use within the <apply> task. I had to sit down and work out how to use them rather than relying on a clear explanation by the book.All in all though I have found this book helpful and I now feel as if I understand ANT quite well."
negative,"Don't waste your time!: I consider myself to be a ""serious"" history buff, and this book is not history! It's a boring rehash from behind the front German generals. What ordeals did they suffer compared to the troops on the line? This book was boring, stilted, and told me nothing I hadn't read elsewhere."
negative,"Babydry?!? Should be called baby wet and leak: These didn't work for my daughter at all. Too short, Leaked every time she urinated. I love Pampers Swaddlers, but the baby dry are awful and not worth the wasted money."
negative,"Terrible book!: Several things are required to write a boring,rip-off book like this:1-A way to publish/publisice the book(his parents own a publishing company)2-Time(he ""graduated"" from homeschool at 15)3-An ego the size of Texas(how could he not?he copies other books,and has the audacity to say on his website ""I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf."")Overall the book was predictable,and obviously copied from Tolkein,Star Wars,etc.May your sword stay as dull as your books,Paolini!"
positive,"Very Cute: The Teletubbies are gentle and caring. I realize there was some controversy over the Teletubbies. However, I found them to teach sweet lessons of caring, watching over each other, gentleness and so on.This video is about going to bed and having sweet dreams. There are lullaby songs, short little segments that are typical of the other Teletubbies vidoes make this a good video to watch for five to ten minutes before turning off the TV. Manners for when someone is sleeping are demonstrated in one segment. Nothing is repeated which makes this a much more engaging video than the other Teletubbies videos.Enjoy."
negative,"Easier way to handle the Mormons at the door.: I have an even easier way to handle the Mormons at the door, and I'll give it to you for FREE. When they come to your door, say ""Thank you, but I'm not interested"" and then close the door. Save yourself 6 bucks and let people believe what they want. I do this every time some person comes peddling to my door. Be it a salesman or a religious representative of any religion."
positive,"A nowadays science-fiction: In 2081, a new kind of telescope, using subtle quantum effects, allows for a detailed examination of all the planets of the galaxy and abroad. Life is present everywhere, but not civilization. Subtle evidences show that civilizations are numerous, but that they disappeared... Where? What is our own enthralling future?This book is anticipation in the Jules Vernes style: bold but realistic prospects with nowaday 2000' science, some scientific popularization, without forgetting warm-hearted characters in an optimistic vision of life.Richard Trigaux, author."
positive,"good: I also expected more, but i liked it a lot. And yes, it is for serious readers (you cant read Jane Austen if youre not one). Is funny and I liked Emma a lot. Although mr. Knightley was too old :p But is great. You must read it."
negative,"Disappointing: The device randomly disconnects itself from the WAP. It may randomly come back again, but no guarantee. The new drivers from Belkin's web site have not solved the problem. Unreliable. Go for another product."
negative,"Bad sound quality: I just purchased this CD via digital download, listened to the tracks, and the quality is BAD!It sounds like the mp3's were digitized using a turntable with a dirty needle! Or when the mp3 file was created that clipping occurred.As this date that I posting this review, DO NOT BUY these mp3s unless you want to hear cracks and pops!The tracks themsevles are good music, but the sound quality sucks!"
positive,"Fine book to read: Even if some people disagree with me, I will say this is one of the best books you can read. Everyone must read this book, it has the power to change your beliefs about the world.1984 goes deep to show you what the world COULD be like if a ruling party did all the right things to gain complete control over the populace. Your daily life monitored continuously, no rights to show individuality or freedom of speech, and constant fear of being whiped clean off the world if you did anything not in accordance with the Party, also known as Big Brother.I sure hope something like this doesn't happen to us any time soon, not until I build my rocket ship to go to Mars and live in a cave.I would certainly recommend this book to you, for only 300 pages it is some good reading."
negative,"A Repetative Scare: In The Haunting a group of people are told they would be paid if they stay in Haunting Hill for one night so a skeptic can prove his point that there is nothing to fear. It isn't long before there are attacks. Such as when the stairs one person is on collapses when he is over a story up, and when a mysterious oversized hand reaches and tries to grab one of the occupants. This movie starts out well because it's scary like it's supposed to be and is very unique, but you quickly notice it's also very repetative."
positive,Wonderful book!: There are so many wonderful recipes in this book that I can't wait to try them all. It has been so much fun reading the book that I am really looking forward to getting all the ingredients and trying them. I plan to take the book over to Scotland when I visit this year to give the family some exciting new ideas. A GREAT BOOK!!
positive,"Mere words cannot describe how astonishing this book is!: This has to be the all time best book I have ever read. The detail is so great you feel as if you are actually there to witness everything. For those of you who have read this, I suggest finishing the trilogy. and for those of you who have, then send some equally good books my way!"
negative,"Buyer beware-this book is part of a system!: I could not understand why Amazon wanted 65 bucks for just a book with no description listed, so I went to Lowes and bought it for 20 bucks. Started reading and immediately found out that every word in the book refers to the authors' protractors and other accessories which can be bought through his web site. If you only bought the book with no accessories as I did, you are pretty much out of the loop as all the pictures and examples include his products. His system may work, but why not be up front about it? Just tell us what is going on, and if you are like me and already have invested in a really good (Starrett) protractor, pass on his book and get a more straightforward guide to installing trim.I also agree with others who think the reviews are fishy. Amazon, you really dropped the ball on this one, with no details on the product.By the way, I took the book back."
negative,"Julia good, Julie lackluster - 2 thumbs down: I wish I hadn't spent $ seeing this since it did bash a political party, which I find divisive for our troubled country right now. Streep's characterization of JC was strong but greatly undermined by a very weak and uninspiring depiction of Julia Powell. More Julie than Julia made for a recipe of too much Julie and not enough Julia to make the film worth it.Here is something tongue in cheek to watch though (: [...]"
negative,"It wasn't good.: ""This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.""-Dorothy Parker. That just about sums up my feeling towards this book."
positive,Great Thriller!!!: This is a great thriller about 2 ladies seeking justice and revenge!!It's a must see!!!
negative,Irobot 3d: The 3d effects were not as expected. Movie wasn't made in 3d likely reason. Not a bad movie in general.
positive,Rush 2: Extreme Racing U.S.A.: It's one of the best games I've played in a while. The only problem is you have to set the car perfect or you can easily over steer. The selection of cars has grown with adding some and deleting some. I like how you can change the engine from a V6 to a V10.
negative,"Contains Alcohol: I'm not going to go into the effectiveness of Motherlove's More Milk Plus but want to warn - Careful, this particular formula has grain alcohol. I bought without knowing or realizing it. I have been using the one WITHOUT alcohol and ran out so bought this on Amazon and noted that it tasted different - it burns (like taking straight shots of vodka) and tastes bad. Upon checking ingredients it shows 42-52% grain alcohol!My preference is for the one without alcohol because it tastes sweeter (actually got so used to it I ended up liking it very much - imagine my distaste when I first put this in my mouth). Not only that, it makes me uncomfortable worrying about traces of alcohol in my b-milk.So 2 stars for this but I'd give the one w/o alcohol 5 stars because it helps with production."
negative,"cheap radio: This radio did not cost much, and did not provide very good service. The tuner was poor, it always drifted off station. The reception was weak as well."
negative,"My Childhood! :(: While the stories are good, what made these books for me as a kid and most people I know was the artwork. MAN, they scared the crap out of me as a kid as well as everyone else. The new artwork is generic Harry Potter-esque and has none of the unadulterated creepiness the original one had. Get the ones with the original art folks, there is a whole new generation out there to be as freaked out as we were."
negative,"Whose Planet Is This For?: A friend gave me a copy of this book--and at first I was delighted. However, it made me more and more uneasy. What difference does it make if we pronounce things differently--even incorrectly--if the people around us understand us? So we don't appear stupid? So we can appear to be elite? Where I live, I often have to listen closely and patiently to understand immigrants' English. It seems silly to worry about trivial differences under these circumstances.Walking through downtown Pasadena today, I heard two girls talking: I'm so excited about esta noche, one said to the other. What fun to bounce between two languages like that! With this kind of vitality, who needs a dried-up old guide to speaking ever so precisely?"
positive,"what the scorps really sounded like.: excellent packaging version of the 1982 reissue version from heavy metal worldwide label, excellent artwork, excellent remastering, and hey finally lonesome crow with lyrics, although I still wish they would rerelease the original full cover ,with rare photos and maybe bonus tracks from those sessions,(unlike the cheap import copy with bonus tracks from virgin killer)this version of lonesome crow is a must get for music collectors and scorpions fans."
positive,"Fantastic: This book has everything, from a beautiful item to display to much more inside the covers. There's no better naval works to be read, than these"
negative,"no color choice, no buy: I want a specific color, not a random one. Thanks to the reviews, I won't be buying this one either !"
negative,"Awful!: I've not had paper jams or feed problems in ten years. Now they are back! In two months I have printed perhaps 100 sheets. Now there is a problem with 3 sheets out of 4. Every other HP printer that I have or have had feeds paper with no problem at all, but this one does not!"
negative,Horrible: This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad writing. Bad acting. Bad plot. I cannot understand any of the good reviews. Save your money and your time.
negative,"Didnt enjoy very much....: This is the second book of Virginia Henley's that Ive read, and I was disappointed in it after reading ""A Year and a Day"". It was no where near the quality of story as a Year. Don't get me wrong I did not hate the book, but I found the characters totally stupid at times, and unintelligable. Im taking my book to the used book store tomorrow to trade for something else. I guess I will have to try another one of Virginia Henley's books to see how they fare."
positive,"On of my favorite Barbra Streisand movies, ever!: I realize it's a bit campy, but I just love this film, and I'd love to see it on DVD in widescreen. But I've no idea why this hasn't been done. The music is great and la Streisand is in top, youthful musical form here. (Forget about Yves). But, don't miss a young Jack Nicholson as Daisy's half-brother. ""Love with all the trimmings"" has to be one of the sexiest numbers ever filmed, not to mention a great song. I love this film. Please, someone! Do a DVD!!!"
negative,"Don't buy the outdated version!: The writting is great, but this version is outdated! It is for the 1998 test objectives that were retired in March! Buy the Fifth Edition of this book."
negative,"Very Disappointing: This book has nothing to teach aspiring foodies about how to cook. The constant references to her sex life and that of her friends is very tiresome, as is the quantity of cuss words, essentially on every page."
positive,"finally!: I found this album on a cassette without a label, listened to it, loved it, then went on a mission to find the name of the album. i finally did (after emailing virtually everyone i know) and hope to have it for my birthday. I just love it! like people before have said, all the songs are so unique and would be gems by themselves on any other band's album, but to have them altogether is magic. my all time favourite song (so far) is the fool on the hill - i listened to it around italy, so whenever i hear it, i adore the song, and think of people, places and things i saw when it was on - i used up so many batteries rewinding the tape so i could hear it again! it gets to the stage where i stop and rewind it halfway through so it never finishes. enjoy..."
negative,Charlie Brown: This book was okay but boring it has no action it also did not change from a little girls voice to a big girl or women voice
negative,"Rates Minus Stars: This is a supposed ""thriller"" that is actually a dull, dialogue ridden yawner with little action and uninteresting characters. The ""mystery"" involved is psuedo-solved in a very unsatisfiying way and the reason behind the murder involved is (to say the least) contrived. I read the descriptions on every box and bag in my cupboard before I resorted to complete the reading of this book. I held out a very small hope that its ""resolution"" might be in some way satisfying. My hopes were crushed. I will avoid this author at all cost in the future."
positive,An old favorite: There is nothing better than rereading the classic story and then watching Alistair Sims play Old Scrooge. It makes for the perfect Christmas tradition.
negative,"Bait, switch, and burn: I was very excited when my wife presented me with the ultimate edtion blu-rays for the third and forth harry potter flims, my excitement quicly faded when I came to realize these were nothing like the first two in the ""ultimate"" series. Unlike the first two there is no addtional scenes edited into the films making the rest of the five hours of extras look as sad and tasteless and the flimsy child's deatheater mask that came with another of thier products. What adds insult to injury for me since it was a gift i can't return it for my money or set it on fire to sooth the burn I feel from being bait and switched by this company. So I'm stuck with them but I'll not be giving them anymore of my money any time soon and I will be urging others to the same.If you agree please go the WB's site and give them the review at home, I did, and now to cut and paste to E-bay review. I can't get my money but I can sread the hate around."
positive,"As a teacher this is a great resource for advancing students: Other reviewers are correct, this is not for beginners. It is intermediate to advanced and worth every penny.I have both of these volumes (1 & 2) and I review them every few months as a reminder and touch up to my playing.I think John is a fine teacher, and if people have not learned the language of music, they may find his explanations confusing. Not his fault, but the short-comings of other reviewers (in my opinion).I found his discussions straight forward, plain, simple to understand and challenging to put to the fingers."
negative,"DVD doesn't work: Funny, just got this review in my email and today was actually the first time I wanted to view this movie. Well, come to find out, it doesn't work. Says its not compatible. I have never ever had a dvd not work. It also said that its not supported under explanation on my player. Well, I will be calling for a refund on this DVD...no sense of wasting money on something that doesn't work. I have seen the movie and I love it...very funny."
positive,"The future of music.: If you are into experimental music then check out El Guapo's ""super/system"". This is experimental indie rock that is actually listenable and fun."
negative,"Olympic dvd: Too little of the the major events that I was interested in, and too much of the little events"
negative,"Didn't help: I bought this to replace my original fuel cap to eliminate check engine issue. However, this fuel cap didn't help and the error codes re-appeared.I bought another fuel cap from Napa and that solved the problem!"
positive,"The closest thing to time travel: This is the first book since ""A Night to Remember"" that actually carries you back through time to the decks of the sinking Titanic until you actually feel it yourself. You feel the emotions of the people that night - and then you are yanked forward in time to the expeditions that first discovered and explored the Titanic, and then Pellegrino moves you back and forth in time again and again from the night of the sinking to the expeditions until at last you become, like James Cameron's Rose, unstuck in time. It is easy to see how Cameron was so moved by Pellegrino's morphings through time. A reading of this scientist's other books reveals that he seems to be unable to tell a tale in linear fashion. In both ""Unearthing Atlantis"" and ""Ghosts of the Titanic,"" he unfolds archaeological investigations by telling the whole history backwards! It is difficult to imagine what he will do with time next. But I'll be there for the ride. You can bet on it."
negative,Tape Reading and Market Tactics: I read the reviews before purchasing and they were outstanding and was shocked when the book arrived because the publishing date was well disguised as this book was written in the 1930's. The forward was updated twice - the last was in the early 1970's. If one would like a nostalgia look at tape reading this book is for you.
positive,"Hey ! It's a nice Chain,: The title says it all. I bought this chain to display many silver based pendants I have collected over the years. The rope necklace was worth the price & then some !"
negative,"Tolkien: I am not a Tolkien fan, I've realized. I could drum up no interest whatever in his stories OR his characters."
positive,"This book has changed my perspective: First of all, to any woman is having doubts about buying ""Why Men Love B!tches,"" I need to tell you - Buy it!I read it in 1 day, I could not put it down and my whole perspective on the dating game has changed. If you are always the girl who is too sweet or too nice and gets walked on, you need this book! And I don't mean to type this review like its the lines for an info-mercial. haha. But, I'm really glad I found this book. I feel like from reading it I have a new sense of what to do out in the dating world, I feel like I can have more confidence now. I now see that I'm the most important thing and when you focus on you, everything else will fall into place and its very important to view yourself as being a PRIZE."
positive,"Elizabeth George Speare rocks!: Well, I've read of all of Speare's works that I can find, The Bronze Bow (awesome), The Sign of the Beaver, Calico Captive (finished it in a day), and The Witch of Blackbird Pond. This one beat them all! I never thought that she could write anything better than the Bronze Bow, but obviously, I was completely mistaken. In fact, this novel replaced my longstanding favorite book, Jane Eyre, as it slowly but surely crept its way up to number 1. I loved it; it's awesome; what else do I need to say? However, if you have no idea what good literature is, then you won't like this outstanding novel."
negative,"Avoid: I was highly disappointed with this cd. Perhaps I expected more of the Kharma era Sanders or any of his early 70's releases. Anyhow I've always experienced Sanders as somewhat of a self indulgent artist even on his best records and in fact some of his best playing really is on other peoples records so in some ways I'm not all that shocked at the medocrity of this cd. The music is bland, overwrought and trite somewhat similiar to any of the faceless and equally uninspired New Age releases that you might stumble upon. This cd should be avoided and if you want to here some more current Sanders check out Sonny Sharrocks album ""Ask The Ages"" that features Sanders without the pretension and self importance."
positive,"a must-get for the battle of geonosis!: My son just got interested in collecting star wars action figures. He found this figure new in the case at a CD store in Greenville, SC. He has really enjoyed using this figure to recreate the battle of geonosis from Attack of the clones. It is also good for Dooku's final battle against Anakin in Revenge of the Sith. The only problem is the the paint on his lightsaber handle wears off easily. But it is a very good toy and an excellant addition to any star wars or action figure collection."
positive,"Basic and just right: This Sanyo rice cooker is just right for cooking rice (what a concept!). It's a plain Jane, but does the job very well. The cooked rice is tender without being mushy, the grains individual and not stuck together in a gummy mess. It's easy to adapt rice cooker recipes - ""The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook"" is a terrific companion and clean-up is fast.If you're looking for a basic rice cooker without the bells and whistles of various programs, this is a good one to choose."
negative,"Don't Waste Your Money: I wish I had come to Amazon.com and read all the negative reviews before I wasted $... on this junk. I read the rave reviews on the back of the book and foolishly bought it. It is a rambling collection of pages about a period of history in which I have no interest (the 1800's) and the writing in very choppy and boring. The back of the book gave no clue as to the time period or the nationality of the characters. The ""coming to America"" stories are my least favorite. I never, ever throw books in the trash-I usually give them to charity or to the library. I threw this one away. I want this book off the street, so no other poor soul would make the same mistake I did and read this drivel."
positive,I love my Sony e-marker!: You do have to remember what station you were listening to but I usually only listen to three different stations and it's easy to switch between the stations on the web site. I also like the sound clip option that is available for many of the songs. If it's been a few days since I've heard the song and I'm not sure about the station I can listen to the sound clip and easily identify the song.I teach an indoor cycling class and have found this to be an invaluable tool for finding great songs!
negative,"""Pop"" psychology at its worse...: ...Mr. Jensen and his wife have developed a veritable cottage industry replete with workshops, seminars, presentations, publications, certifications -- if you've got the money then they have something to sell you...and all of it is centered around what is termed ""brain-based learning""...but what this book presents is little more than 400 pages of scientifically unsubstantiated claims and recommendations...for example, it claims that the color yellow somehow enhances intellectual performance and, hence, classrooms should be painted yellow...however, he doesn't offer a shred of evidence to back that claim up...it's all just ridiculous...how does this stuff ever make it into print?"
positive,"QUITE THE MAN: This is a wonderful abbreviated version about a great man of his century that could take up volumes and volumes. The tome was informative, precise and a joy to wander through this man's accomplishments. It's not necessary to list everything that should be in his obit - read it. It will be worth your while."
positive,"Superb story!: I have read a lot of Joni's books, and being a paraplegic, I have corresponded with her as well. This true story starring Joni as herself, really makes you look at life in a different perspective. EVERYONE needs to watch this movie or at least read the book."
positive,Where the Cypress Rises: This is an unusually perceptive and open first-hand account of an artist and her family's move to Umbria. Unsentimental descriptions of their everyday joys and frustrations are counter-pointed by the dramatic upheaval of major earthquakes. Ryan articulates connections between the natural and built environments and the adventure of the self; between ancient traditions and contemporary creativity. I found it highly engaging - a page-turner. I'll return to it.
positive,"The Elements of Style Illustrated: I gave this book as a gift to someone who has always touted the original. She was skeptical at first about its needing illustrations, but thought it might induce younger people to check it out. As far as I know, she is very satisfied."
positive,"A Good Book The Hobbit: You can not put this book down! For there is a lot of action and a favorite wizard Gandalf. You know from the movie ""Lord of the Rings.""Well I give The Hobbit four stars out of five. My reasoning for this is because some parts get dall and you can't wait untile it is over; but then agian some parts you can not put this book down because of all the action.The Hobbit is like a spin off of the book ""The Lord of the Rings,"" because it has Bilbo Baggins going on this crazy adventure with the dwarfs to get reveng on a dragon. On the way to persue the dragon they have absocales to face in which caves to exploer and such. Well I enjoyed The Hobbitand if you pick it up and read it am sure you will like it too."
negative,"Avoid this product.: A man should not smell like an entire bottle of cologne when he gets out of the shower, nor should the entire house he lives in smell like a giant vat of cologne. Go buy a bottle of nondescript body wash and after your shower apply a few squirts of the cologne of your choice. But really, why would you need cologne if you're just going to the office?! You don't! Please make it stop!"
negative,on order: I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.
negative,"Good music, but the quality is awful: I love Joe Williams' voice. Every Day I Have the Blues is great. But the quality of the recording [stinks]. It sounds like it was recorded in the 1920s. I regret buying this cd."
positive,"surprised: I was very surprised at this movie. I really enjoyed it. The acting was very good. The story kept me on the edge of my recliner. At first it seemed like the typicle tv movie, but i was proven wrong. I highly recomend this movie."
negative,"A betrayal of the book: Those of us who grew up with and loved the books, were able to overlook the differences in the first 2 movies because for the most part they kept the characters true. This last movie was just a horrible mess! Except for looking the same, I had no idea who these characters even were! Save yourself and dont even bother."
positive,Awesome book: It was one of the best books I have ever read actually it is theonly book I have ever read
positive,Great product: We really love the Pampers baby dry for our 13 month old. We can't really think of any significant leaks be it during the night( when we don't change his nappies cause it disturbs his sleep)or during the day. Also with Amazon's great prices it is a good buy...
positive,"This is one of my all time favorite cd's!: I absolutely love this cd. It reminds me of the 80's music I grew up on. When I first heard ""Ooh it's kinda crazy"" I did think it was George Michaels and I was pleasantly surprised when I purchased this cd that Soul Decision is talented enough to write their own lyric's I don't think there is a song on this cd that I don't like. This cd puts me in a good mood, if you can appreciate a good love song and enjoy easy listening music with a pop and funky beat this cd is for you! I hope they come out with another cd soon."
positive,A classic: Never read this before but understand why everyone likes it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read.
negative,"Size of Print: The print in this book is very small and I find that my eyes begin to hurt after awhile. It definitely, for me, interferes with the pleasure of reading the book."
negative,"did not purchase or receive: did not purchase , did not purchase, did not purchaser, did not purchase, get it!! i have bo experience. i prurchased the other 2 disc ""longest day"""
negative,"Sized Incorrectly: I purchased 2 Intex Pillow Rest Twin Beds due to the size specifications of 40 X 80 X 18 1/2"". They were to be used by my >6 ft. tall family members when visiting. I was extremely disappointed when we inflated the 1st bed - which BARELY measured 32 X 70 X 16. I sent a letter to the supplier, CMS WorldWide Sales, explaining my dissatisfaction & was told to send pictures & measurements (which I did) and they would [quote]...""Once you had provided us the information we had requested, we will be glad to forward you the return shipping labels.""This was months ago, and to date I still have 2 Intex Pillow Rest Beds (the 2nd box was never even opened!) that are no where near the specs stated on the packaging.I will NEVER order anything from the CMS WorldWide Sales supplier again."
positive,Anthony Wilson's Recording SAVIVTY.: I have listened to other recordings by Anthony Wilson and as with this and the others they are very enjoyable. I do look forward to hearing more (future as well as past that I have not yet heard) from this artist. Thank you.
negative,"One word: Garbage: I have been using this printer for over a year. This is a very loud and inefficient printer. It can't even print doc well. I use top quality paper and this does not help. It is a particularly voracious ink eater as well. Stay away from it, even if they give it to you .. It is huge."
positive,"Troy is very underrated: It is an amazing album,i love it, the inclusion of troy takes the music to another level, buy it! Everybody knows that youre insane is out of this world!"
positive,"Insightful look at the war of ideas...: This is an insightful look by the renowned conservative historian and economist at George Mason University, Thomas Sowell. It probes the on-going cultural war of ideas between the Left and Right. I also recommend the Vision of the Annointed by Sowell and Intellectuals by Paul Johnson."
positive,"A Mixed Bag: Having several times made the trip to Normandy and the beaches, I was initially very impressed with the accuracy of the landscape. Moreover,based upon my reading of the history, the movie itself is, overall, a very true to fact rendition of the events of that day. And though not as grimly realistic as subsequent cinematic depictions of the events, it does capture the angst.For me the only disconcerting flaw in the rendition is the typical 1960's cinematic tendency to ""cuteness"". There are numerous examples, but the scene showing the two opposing files of Germans and American troops along a low wall was just too egregiously precious."
negative,Dissatisfy: I purchased these shoes for my Son - He owns a Landcaping Company and he walks alot... After one week the sole separated from the shoe - He had to stop and buy a roll of duck tape. He love the way they felt and his feet wasn't as tired by the end of the day. Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good.
negative,"Absolutely Terrible!!: As most Stephen King fans, I bought this book without following any suggestions,or reading any reviews---just because he is Stephen King. I began reading this book over 3 weeks ago, and I finally put it down yesterday because after 400 pages, I just didn't care to finish it.(I read the first 200 pages in a little over a day). Shame too, because ""Dreamcatcher"" began as such a promising story,written by the man who I attribute many hours of captivating reading. Not this time. Don't bother!"
positive,"Read this book!: I really can't give this novel any less than five stars. I read it every year and find something new, something often horrifyingly accurate in whatever political climate you're in. READ IT!"
negative,"Poorly compiled.: That's it. Don't bother. The big print in the book garners it the one-star review, otherwise I would have given it none."
negative,"no product: I am unable to review this product as the item NEVER arrived and I ended up with a refund.Will be looking for another source, and trying to order it again.If and when I finally do get the item I will let you know what I think about it then."
negative,"Useless: I was so excited to receive this to help my 5 year old with her addition and subtraction. You are supposed to press on the button and ""magically"" the correct answer appears.No magic here! The answers are simply underneath and as you push, the correct answers underneath are supposed to become more transparent or visible (similar to using tracing paper and placing it over something you want to trace. The closer the tracing paper is to the image you want to copy, the more clearly you can see it.) Well, neither my daughter nor I could even make out what the answers were. How are we supposed to read THROUGH a plastic button? It made no sense.This was really a disappointment and such a waste!"
negative,"not sturdy: I got this for my 15 mt old daughter for Christmas. I am most disappointed with the lack of sturdiness of the plastic base pieces. Also, there are levers that you can flip down under the piano part that is supposed to keep the piano steady instead of letting it rock. My piano levers did not work and the piano always rocks. The long piece that runs from the piano base out to hold the seat part is very flimsy and bends quite easily. The seat itself does not fit properly onto the long plastic piece that is supposed to hold it. The screws to attach the long piece to the piano and the screws to attach the seat were very difficult to work with and they never did go in right. My daughter does love to play the keys on the piano and the music is quite nice but the design of the seating section needs some improvement."
positive,"I love this product: I have been searching the product like this for long time,I got one. The important feature are pronounciation and quickfind. Just by mouse over the word you can find out the meaning."
negative,Not good at all: I got one of these a year ago. The issue I had was that the thing only had about 15mins of power before shutting down. That is usb or powering a 7w fluorescent bulb AC.
negative,"Duck and Cover: Duck and Cover, Take the Money and Run, etc are some of the phrases that come to mind when I think of how I would describe this movie. No, more correctly these are phrases that would describe why Mel Gibson would ever make a movie like this. They had to drag me to the theatre in the first place to see this film. Luckily I needed no such assistance when the film ended. Seriously, this is a very forced comedy and not a very good one."
negative,"Not worth the money: I've read hundreds of fantasy books and this is definitely the worst I've had the misfortune to read. Instead of reading this poorly conceived knock-off, I recommend that young readers check out Anne McCaffrey's Dragonsong trilogy, Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea series, Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain series, Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series, or if you like SciFi, Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series.I found Eragon to be a simplistic reworking of stories/themes. It is sad that the publisher's of the 21st century are playing it ""safe"", like most modern entertainment, and giving us nothing new. I was surprised that Anne McCaffrey endorsed this book. She writes ""pulp fiction"" fantasy too, but hers is much better. He even takes the name ""Eragon"", which is very similar to a character in her book, The Skies of Pern, named Erragon.I've never returned a book for my money back, so this was a first."
positive,"Not Bad At All.....: This is the first romance novel I've been able to read through from beginning to end in a long time. Nothing unusual about the story. Just light, breezy read on a Sunday afternoon.And both lead characters were likeable. Something that's harder and harder to find in the genre, IMHO."
negative,"They burst when full: I bought these as a ""night time"" diaper. Most of the time, they work great. However, if the diaper gets too full, they just burst and the absorbant material goes everywhere (about the consistency of little bits of tapioca). It is very difficult to get all of it off of my daughter without giving her a bath, and I worry about what chemicals it might contain. This has probably happened three times in the last two months (only putting the diapers on at night). I am going to stop using them now. As a note, my daughter weighs about 24 pounds, so we are on the low end of the weight range."
negative,"Downright Awful: Soundgarden rules. No doubt about it. But if this is the best Chris Cornell can do on his own, he should bring the band back. This album is painfully bad. I was reaching for the advil midway through the third song. This is NOT anything like temple of the dog either. Any moron who loved this album was not a big fan of BadMotorFinger."
negative,"Manufactured garbage re-packaged: Sweat and Suit were two of the absolute worst albums of last year. Sadly, both of those disasters are being re-packaged and released again. Everything on here is just terrible. ""Grillz"" is also one of the worst songs I've ever heard all year. It figures that only Nelly would make a stupid song about his diamond teeth. It also figures he'd make a song with that horrible H-Town rapper Paul Wall. I blame Nelly for the state of hip hop today. He also created hip-pop which is one of the worst music genres ever created. Hell Cash Money and G-Unit make better club songs than this idiot. One of the year's absolute worst albums."
negative,"picture freeze: Just like Arie Socorro, I had the same problem on the picture freezing on that particular chapter. You have to skip to the next chapter to get it going. Other than that this movie is great"
positive,"Perfect for every Blue's Clues fan and their parents: I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this CD. But my 2 year old is a huge fan of the show, so I took a gamble and that CD doesn't owe me a nickel. It is just as clever as the TV show with the same format. The new songs are entertaining for both of us and the old stand bys are there so he can sing along. It is terrific. The only problem is there is only one ""episode"" on the market. Please hurry and make another one!! I think we know this one by heart!!!"
negative,Leaky: My baby wakes up everyday with wet clothes in front! Not something we have every had in the past 13 mo's with other brand diapers. Would not buy these diapers again. The fabric is soft and the diaper is not stiff I do like the texture and overall feel but when the baby is waking up wet and mad this needs to be addressed. Defiently not Baby dry! Overall not satisfied.
negative,"Poor design: Although advertised to fit a 1996 Suburban, they do not. The tab on the back is not aligned and it doesn't fit flush like it is supposed to."
positive,excellent book: good product and good bible study material. learn lots about the work of the holy spirit and how it builds community
positive,"A nice package!: Postcards From The Edge is a wonderful, edgy comedy with a tightly written script, wonderful lead performances, and it is littered with cameos and small roles that give a industry-insider feel without detracting from the story. If you love State & Main...you need to watch this as well."
negative,"Skanky lightning in a bottle: I have heard many CD's in my day, and none have irritated me as much as this CD. They spout of phrases of anarchy and rebellion while doing the talk show circuit promoting this piece of crap. They seem to be the worst kind of hypocrites, ones with a bad sense of humor. Tumpthumping looses it appeal the second your hangover sets in and manages to sit in your head for the rest of the day. It seems destined to become a staple in the yuppie dance floors of the future. After sitting through the full 45 minutes or so of the Chumbawumba exprience, I reversed my stance on euthenasia. Stay away, fa r away. Unless you are completely lacking in taste, then you have my blessing."
positive,"Good introduction to superstring theory -: This book was a good introduction to a topic I was curious about and many other general topics as well. Higher dimensions, matter-energy and space-time, relativity, black holes, wormholes, and time travel are all covered. This book was written to be understood by the layman but some of the explanations could have been more technical. This is still a great start for someone interested in these topics."
negative,"zZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz: This CD is so boring! There are no good up beat trax on this cd, Buy this CD if you like for music to put you to sleep!"
positive,"He's done it again!: I have all four of Dierks' albums. From the minute I heard ""What was I Thinking"" for the first time, I have been a fan and have seen him live seven times.Long Trip Alone is mature and polished. The production is seamless and the band is hot. It's hard to pick my favorite cut but ""Soon as you can"" is a winner as is ""That don't make it easy loving me"".There is something genuine about a guy who sings about honky tonks and heaven. Buy this disc - you won't be sorry!"
negative,"No.: Just....don't. I tried watching it, I really did...this neither follows nor references the Halloween franchise, and lacks *any* discernible theme or plot. Seriously - what did I just watch 40 minutes of?"
positive,"Genuine Page-Turner: This book was very intriging without being bloody and gory. Each character had substance, either you loved them or hated them. Larry Douglas and Noelle Paige were definate ""hates."" Also, I learned a great history lesson, too. Sheldon certainly did his homework on this one. Good til the end."
negative,"FERTILIZER FOR THE GARDEN: This story was so bad that it was EMBARRASSING! Olivia, the matriarch of the Dollanganger twins is featured in this tired prequel. Bitter and resentful over her lot in life, she marries an unloving man named Malcolm and has two sons.Irate over Malcolm's adulterous ways, Olivia understandably resents Malcolm's latest love interest, the lovely Alicia. She doesn't take into consideration that Malcolm rapes Alicia and this act results in the birth of Alicia's daughter, Corinne. Malcolm insists on naming his baby Corinne after his dead mother. During Alicia's pregnancy, Olivia keeps her away from her son Chris (who would later, with Corinne, become the parents of the Dollanger 4) locks her away in the attic (the attic again)!Alicia is a fool for allowing Olivia to spirit Chris away and even more foolish for letting Olivia keep Corinne in that malignant household. Common sense does not enter into this story.This book is good fertilizer for the garden."
positive,Offic Space with FLAIR: I love this pre 21st century movie. The CD came in good condition which is all one can ask for in a product that one has already watched several times before. Good stuff.
positive,primo toothpicks: These are absolutely the best toothpicks you'll ever use! Love the brush on one end and the tapered end on the other. These work great!
negative,"A disappointment: Having heard the author speak on the radio, her works praised highly by the host, I decided to start with the first of the Monk series. Unfortunately, I found the main character thoroughly unsympathetic and unlikable. The story was slow as molasses with bits and pieces of useless information thrown in to fatten the book. Also, I don't know the clinical features of amnesia, but it seemed that Monk's memory loss was selective and inconsistent. The ending was highly anti-climactic and the fate of the characters in question never revealed. I was very much looking forward to reading her books, but was sorely disappointed."
positive,"A Voice From the Past: Professor Rogin explains much about our country and our national mind-set although this book is not for the casual reader. The simplistic, politial tract of Ann Coulter, for instance, is to this seriously written HISTORY as a supermarket tabloid is to a play by Maxwell Anderson. Professor Rogin presents Senator McCarthy as a rational outgrowth of the fear of change that gripped the conservative mind just following WW2.Even today, some of the same fear is used by those who wish to USE the easily led. ""Socialist!"" ""Communist!"" are often lables attenpted to be tied to those who simply think as liberals. If there were a charming McCarthy who knows how far such movements would go?As always, I am thamkful for Amazon. I can find and buy VERY extraordinary books at very reasonable prices and have them delivered to my door."
negative,"i didnt understand: I bought this book hoping it could help me understand shakespeare's words better, but it didnt. Instead I had to look up every other word in a dictionary or sometimes even online. Soon it just got so hectic that i just threw the book out and bought a better more reliable source."
negative,"No Masterpiece: I'm not sure why I've given this movie one star. Perhaps it's because of McDowell's acting, which is good. When I saw the film in 1971 it made a big impact: 32 years later it says nothing at all. I'm not shocked by violence or nudity; it's just that it's a very poor work of art, empty of everything except design, ugly, repellent design. I'm beginning to think Kubrick must be the most overrated director of all time. As another reviewer has pointed out, his films seemed to get steadily worse and worse. And all of them have one thing in common: they are s-l-o-w. It seems to me that Kubrick was obsessive and dedicated, but just not very bright. He was also, apparently, intensely depressed about life. Still, it was clever of him to make such a big thing of these disadvantages. I suppose his films are worth seeing, once only. But after the first sensation of puzzled surprise, they just turn into hideously tedious sludge."
negative,"Why Couldn't We Get the Uncut Concert??????: It's a mystery to me why the Hendrix family (ExperienceHendrix) couldn't release the complete and uncut recording of this performance. Instead of releasing the complete recording of this historic concert, the Hendrix family has edited (or deleted) instrumental sections (from songs), guitar solos, some of Hendrix' comments between songs, Larry Lee's solos, most of the percussion section, and two songs (Gypsy Woman and Mastermind).The Hendrix family has announced in the past they have hours of live recordings. It's probably safe to say that we can expect more of the same with regard to these future recordings, that is edited songs, deletion of songs, etc.Unfortunately, we'll never be able to experience these shows complete and uncut. Despite Jimi's musical prowess and talent, which is in abundance on this recording, I can't recommend it."
negative,"egregiously bad: I agree with the previous reviewer; I 'bought' the full book (as it was free) and found it so full of garbled text & typographic garbage as to make it, for novices, worth its price: nothing."
positive,"brilliant: C.S. Lewis, besides being a great fiction writer and a fair poet, is a briliant mind. His theology, well, his theology is the theology that you want to read. When you read this book you can really see one of the greatest minds at work. For the faithful as well as the unfaithful intellect, this is a book to read."
negative,"Still haven't received item: Bought for my mom for Christmas she loves this perfume and it does actually smell pretty good however I was supposed to recieve my order by the 20th at the latest.its now the night of the 22nd and I am very worried it wont be here for Christmas. UPDATE: Spoke with Amazons customer service and they are replacing my missing item. It will be here tomorrow. Still sucks cuz it wasn't here in time for christmas, however I'm just glad they are replacing it for me."
negative,Boring!: William Golding likes to kill you with detail in this book and he comes pretty close! There is one part about a fox and you wish that you would just die. The characters are confusing and the book is just bad!
positive,"An old favorite: This movie has been an old favorite in my family for as long as I can remember. Danny Kay is hilariously funny, and the storyline absurd and entertaining. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for lighthearted fun."
positive,"Julie and Julia: Julie Powell is in a rut; not enjoying her job anymore and feeling somewhat purposeless. On a trip back home to her parent's house, she finds a copy of Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking and comes up with a crazy idea. Over the course of one year, she is going to cook every recipe in the book and write a blog about it. This book is an extension of that blog and her experiences during the project.Julie is a humourous writer and does not glamourize her feelings, successes, and failures during the year of cooking. Some of the side stories about her friend's lives could have been shortened or left out, as I found myself losing interest in these parts. I would also have liked to read more about Julia Child as well, but overall, this is a fun read that really lets you get to know Julie....and way more about bone marrow and killing lobsters than you ever wanted to!"
positive,"Tis is a excellent book.: I feel that the textbook, Fundamentals of Management by Stephen P. Robbins and David A. DeCenzo, is a good book for the beginning management student. The book made use of illustrating it's points by using graphs. This is important for the students who are having a hard time understanding what the author is trying to say. It's hard for someone to succeed at something if they do not understand the different aspects. I would recommend this book to anyone who is planning to have a career in business."
negative,"Far too blatant an ending: To Mr. O'Brien:Damn you sir. A well-written book, but you leave the exploits of Aubery and Maturin, and the status of Mss. Sophie and Diana quite unresolved...a blatant call to purchase the next novel.I shall read no more of your scrivening, sir, Forester would not leave his readers hanging so. Your technical knowlege is not sufficient to save you. Were I a Gentleman, I should challenge you at the next opportunity. Enough!"
positive,"Great Cookbook: Texas Ties is a wonderful cookbook. Everything that I have made from this book is delicious!!! It uses fresh ingredients so all of the dishes are full of rich flavor. It also makes a great birthday, holiday or house warming present."
positive,"Based on the South African release of this tape: Based on the South African release of this tape, it is actually quite good and informative. It includes the music videos: Hold On, Release me, Impulsive, You're inlove, The Dream is still alive, You won't see me cry. It also includes some behind the scene footage of the ""You won't see me cry"" music video. Also, between the videos there's some interview footage with the girls of Wilson Phillips (Chynna Phillips, Wendy and Carnie Wilson).I wish they can release a full DVD with the music videos of these gifted singers. I've seen on the web that there were videos made for Flesh and Blood (from the Shadows and Light cd) and also some of their other songs - they can also include live footage from shows of these girls. The Bangles were released on DVD why not Wilson Phillips?"
positive,"Breathtaking scenery: ""The Wonders of Alaska"" DVD makes you feel like you've actually taken an Alaskan cruise around this vast state and its beautiful nature scenery. Where else can you see whales and bears in their natural environments, massive glaciers and vast wilderness? The DVD is exciting, with beautiful footage, interesting content and great narration. I highly recommend this DVD to all nature lovers wanting to experience the wonders of Alaska."
negative,Not worth it: We tried this dish a couple of times. It didn't warm the foods that much more than just putting warm food on a plate & feeding it to your hungry baby. Just another (unnecessary) step in the feeding progress. Don't waste your time.
negative,"Disappointment: If your going back and forth between this bag and the other bag (Classic Accessories 74877 Hitch Tote), get the other one, this one is crap. The material used is a very thin, paper-like material that you sometimes see items wrapped in during shipping. I was thinking (hoping?) it was nylon or gym bag-like material, but it's not. It's not very puncture proof. Also, there are no pockets or dividers, not really a big deal, just FYI."
negative,"Too long between books: When I found out Jean Auel had a new book out, I bought the hard cover not wanting to wait for the soft to come out. That was a mistake. I have been a big fan of Jean Auel for years, and have read her previous books numerous times. Shelter of Stone however left much to be desired. Her detailed description of ""everything"" was a bit much. I enjoy a good detailed book, but this one was overdone. I had to force myself to pick the book back up and continue reading it. The first five hundred pages were slow going, but after that, things picked up and it was easier to read. Hopefully her next book will be less descriptive of rocks and ledges and more of the story of Ayla and her new homeland."
negative,"Yes, weird line breaks: I downloaded the sample chapter onto my Kindle and yes, the line breaks are strange. It does not read flush left to flush right, but rather like poetry in couplets. Which is ironic, given how poorly poetry line breaks are done on many e-readers."
negative,"dawn on a distant shore: Very disapointing. I loved Into the Wilderness and could not wait for DDS, signing up for delivery before it came out in print. I found it difficult to get into and just didn't keep my attention. I actually had to force myself to sit down and finish it. Sadly, DDS lacked the excitement and sexual tensions of Into the Wilderness. Definately not Sara Donati's best work."
negative,"stan larano: wish it had ac cord,batteries on high only last a few hours no good for my purpose,won't go overnight.......good for a few hours outdoors.......Wenzel LED Fan Light"
negative,Horrible: Not a good tank game at all. My grandson hated it. Won't be buying any more of these Panzer Commander videos.
negative,Unhappy Customer: I do not recommend this toy for a child of any age. The noise that is supposed to be music is scratchy and unclear. It most certainly is not relaxing.This product is a waste of money.
positive,Great: I was so pleased with this CD when I listened to it. His voice is amazing and the songs are great too. I highly recommend it.
positive,"Sensual and erotic.: This is the best gay paranomal erotica I have read and I have read quite a few. The sex is steamy because this writer bares all with her words. Add to that a touch of magic and the sex is also sensual and alluring. As in ""A bit of Rough"", Ms Baumbach once again proved her talents. This story is not merely sizzling sex. Her characters, both main and secondary, are well developed and her world building skills is a pleasant surprise in this latest effort. I will read any m/m stories from this writer. Surfing her website I am glad she has quite a few planned in the horizon. Looking forward to her summer release in Loose-id website."
positive,"One of my most often-watched DVDs: This was the third DVD I ever bought, simply because it was inexpensive. It is a wonderful movie with great characters, and I have watched it at least as often as any other DVD in my collection. Very enjoyable. Be forewarned, however, that the DVD transfer quality is very poor. The first time I watched it, I was surprised when I saw ""lint"" on the picture in some frames! You can forgive that when you remember how little you paid."
positive,"100 years of solitude: Garcia Marquez is the best writer in Latin America. He show to the hole world our pains, our fantasies and our feelings and nobody can make the same like him. He is so sensibile like his own people but he have the great chance to tell things in beautifull and wonder words (I hope you can understand my english)"
positive,"Lauryn Hill: What can I say about this artist and her CD? I think if you ever like just a song from this artist, then you should definitely look into obtaining this CD for your ears pleasure :D"
positive,"It is about time for this release.: I first bought this movie on Laser Disk (3 disks) withall of the deleted footage and the additional ""making of""material. The underwater stage and filming were well done and the use of new diving equipment to make the movie that much more realistic was a great part. The directors cut helps make the movie more understandable, although I would agree that the pace can be somewhat nerve racking. The few technical in-accuracies are not enough to go into here because VERY FEW movies are made totally technically accurate and if more were there would be more box office failures.Overall a good movie and the documentary makes a good learning experience on some of the technology used to make movies.Review based on Laser Disk Version END"
negative,Visioneer doesn't honor its warrenty: My visioneeer scanner broke down after 3 months of use ... Visioneer isn't standing up to its warrenty claims.
negative,"Title is deceiving: I was a rookie golfer when I bought these golf balls, was under an assumption that I was getting 90 golf balls.I felt like they were just ordinary ones, nothing special to mention about it."
positive,"probably best way to demonstrate different martial art forms: Actually not a bad martial arts movie. sure it is simple, but that is not a bad thing in this case. Rather than a contrived and cliched plot, this movie (based on the real experience of Frank Dux) displays different forms of martial arts through the brutal kumite (similar to shoot fights or UFC). The sub-story of two US government officials chasing after Frank is fairly pointless and doesn't add anything to the story (and neither does the ""love"" interest), but overall a good display of different martial art styles."
positive,"A little something for everyone: I wasn't sure what to expect with this CD other than a great voice. What I got was that and a great mixture of ballads, mid-tempo songs and songs filled with angst and love. There is something for everyone on this album. Don't listen to reviews that say it is too vanilla or lacks even a hint of sexual innuendo. Listen to the song Touch and hear the sexy longing in the voice and the words. The only thing better than listening to this album would be to see it performed live."
negative,"Oh dear............................ this is not good.: Rod, I love you, always have.I just couldn't get into the American song book stuff. In fact the first of such albums when straight into my bin.To hear you were doing a ""rock"" album was news I needed to hear!!!This is not that album. Get back to me when your ""rock"" album is coming out.So don't do this to us again ......... you're a naughty boy, now go to your room and think about what you've done!! You too, Mr Big Shot Clive James, I'm sure you're involved with this somehow."
negative,"Not that good: The movie itself was at best camp. Poor story line, poor acting, disjointed plot. On top of that the qualify of the video sound was horrible. The voices were completely out of sync with the video. For some reason if you tried to fast forward (which did not work) it would get the voices back in sync with the video . Had to do that about 15 times. I really should ask for my money back but just not worth the time and frustration of Amazon telling me I am the only one (ever heard that before) with this problem and maybe my comcast internet connection isn't fast enough - it is - there are none faster except maybe fios."
negative,"Red mug with hearts has poor quality glazing cup generates a lot of heat in microwave: I purchased 8 mugs from Fred Meyer in Eugene, Or. 1-2 years later all but 1 of the mugs are chipped. I would not purchase this product until the manufacturer improves the glaze. When the glaze chips off it takes a chunk out of the cup. At $8.99 per cup I am very disappointed."
negative,"Canada Green Grass, not green: I order the Canada Green Grass about a month ago, I wanted to re-seed my back yard, evendo my brother told me not to buy it because he lose his money. I follow the instructions on the label and it never germinate. So I end with two bags of seeds that are good for nothing. I will not recomend anybody to spend their money."
positive,Excellent use of Humor to teach Finance: Robert Cooke use humor throughout the book to help nonfinancial manager understand financial reports. The use of the Spouse House Firm throughout the book allows you to see the develop of financial reports as they apply to a small growing firm. Robert writes as he is right in front of you talking to someone he has known for a long time. He uses humor to help you understand the difficult concepts of the book. If you are looking to learn financial statements or just refresh your skills this is the book I recommend.
positive,"again a milestone of electronic music: Highly praised album that was recorded in January 1977 and shows Klaus Schulze possibly at his artistic peak. Here we have two titles reaching the 30-minute mark that a musically very different from another (like ""Timewind""). From dark, ambient noises to melodies of unearthly beauty Klaus Schulze shows us all he has to offer. And what he delivered on side 2 with ""Crystal lake"" surely belongs to the top 5 five recordings of electronic music ever made, a track of almost mythical quality. If you're a fan of Tangerine Dream's ""Cherokee lane"" on the Encore album (and who isn't?!) you will play this piece a dozen and dozen times until you CD player begins to smoke. To sum it up: buy ""Mirage"" and lose your head."
negative,"A poor implementation of Plug N' Play: This device should configure a lot easier than it does. I'm a programmer with many years of experience configuring hardware. I found this one annoying to set up.You may have to download new drivers for this device from the simpletech website. Once you get the correct version of the drivers, and install it following the instructions EXACTLY (the device cannot be plugged in while loading the software) it eventually works ok.Note that there are two DIFFERENT part numbers for this device. 90000-40388-001 and 90000-40388-002. The 001 version does not support some platforms that the 002 version does. I recieved the 001 and have had no end of difficulty with it.If I had it to do over again, I would spend a bit more, and get a device from another company that supported more than two media types."
positive,Highwater mark of Seventies Film-making: Probably the greatest use of film-making artifice in the last 50 years. Stanley Kubrick uses sight and sound like no other. He melds all of his tricks into a mind-blowing whole giving the film a present-future-timeless feel. Malcolm McDowell is just incredible in this movie. As wicked as he is we still have a certain empathy for him. Without a doubt this movie is a must own. Everybody should study it for the wealth of aesthetic horizons it reveals.
negative,"An E-Book RIP-OFF: There is nothing whatsoever to justify the high price. It is a book with no extras, unless you count the excessive errors. It has the feel of something which was scanned by an eighth grader with a short attention span. Missing and extra spaces, incorrect spellings which appear to be a result of scanning with fifteen year old OCR software, and improper formatting.I actually like the story more than I did thirty years ago, though that old paperback had fewer errors."
positive,"Great..: Anne did a wonderful job ""being British"" and I LOVE all of the actors in this movie. It was a beautiful script and well done. Great story.."
negative,"NO COMMENT: AS I LIVE IN EUROPE, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WATCH THIS BLU RAY DVD.THE FORMAT WAS NORMALLY ""ALL REGIONS"" BUT I GUESS THAT ONLY THE PEOPLE WITH A REGION 1 APPARATUS COULD WATCH IT. SO I SPENT MY MONEY FOR NOTHING. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. I WANTED TO SEND IT BACK TO AMAZON BUT FINALLY I CHANGED MY MIND BECAUSE I WOULD I HAVE LOST MONEY."
negative,"disappointing: It usually takes a while for me to appreciate each PJ album but this one never came around. The only song I really like on the CD was ""Rival."" It was kind of depressing because I kept listening to the CD waiting to discover something brilliant like I have in the past and it never happened (except for Rival)."
positive,"Worth Owning: Love the conversational tone the book is written in. The ""introduction to crochet"" instructions are easy to follow (I'm sort of a beginner), and I really like quite a few of the patterns.And yes, there WERE errors in the patterns, but if you get the most recent printing of the book, those errors have been fixed."
positive,"Classic: Heartbreaking, yes; but definitely a classic worth reading and re-reading. Steinbeck is one of the great American writers, and his stories are gripping, heartbreaking, redeeming, and moving."
positive,"Mystical, enchanting, funny: The Hobbit is a kinda fairytale about Bilbo, the hobbit, and his journeys throughout the world, to retreive the dragon's treasure. He meets many strange and wonderful characters along the way, each adding a twist to the story. I recommend it to 12- year olds."
negative,"I DON'T GET IT: I don't understand why Gabriel Garcia Marquez will get such great reviews on 100 years of solitude, I thought it was one of the worst piece of Magical Realism that I have ever read.Don't waste your time or money on this terrible piece of literature, Sincerely, it is a pointless, mediocre and most definitely not Nobel Prize material."
negative,"Excellent start but falls flat: This book has an interesting goal: To explain engineering failures. But instead of an in-depth failure analysis of the Hyatt hotel, Tacoma Narrows Bridge, and buses, the reader gets the same simple ideas repeated again and again. The Hyatt hotel disaster is mentioned in detail three times before its chapter. That chapter just retells the story and adds little value or insight. This book needs better organization and more real detail and in-depth analysis."
positive,"Pharisee bashing: Excellent book. Lawrence is the only writer I know of who was able to trace the priggish type of American back to Benjamin Franklin. Franklin was a great man, but one of his more regrettable legacies appears in the modern WASP holier-than-thou type, the type that thinks it's inherently immoral to stay up late, and inherently moral to be a non-smoker. Take a close look at his interests and you'll see that it's to his advantage to preach what is, basically, servility. The rest of us Americans can't stand him (I'm convinced that Al Gore lost the election because he embodies this type), but his belief in his own piety remains unshaken to this day. Well, Lawrence gives him a perfectly-placed kick: check it out.All of these essays are thoughtful, funny, and insightful. Lawrence has a unique way of grasping the undercurrents of works of fiction, and many of his most surprising assertions ring true upon reflection."
negative,"Overrated: Overrated. Just god awful, can't stand it. Ok, I know that isn't really helpful, but I have a feeling that this is one of those books that everyone claims to enjoy becuase they don't want to be accused of ""not getting it."" The characters were really difficult to care about, and the writing was just blah. Truly overrated (like most Oprah books)."
positive,"Above grade: Very good horror flic. But the DVD ending left me puzzled. Turn out the lights, you'll be rewarded."
positive,"I love Jeremy Brett!: Okay, maybe I'm partial because of my deep and undying love for Jeremy Brett, but I love every video in this series. This one is a little skimpy on Brett-time, and it's not clear who some of the characters are. I think this comes from extending one of the shortest stories in the Canon into a two-hour movie. But if you want to see Holmes as a weepin', kissin' fool, this is the film for you. This is one of the only episodes where Holmes shows anything approaching deep emotion, and I love it just for that. And Jeremy Brett. (Yeah, I know he's dead. If I ever learn how to revive people...never mind.)"
negative,"Not what I'd call swing...: I was looking for another BBVD album, but this definatly is not the right choice. Maybe another one of theirs would be better. Man! Now I have to go back to the store and return it. It's probably great music, but I don't care much for this particular style, especially when I expected Mambo Swing or Go Daddy-O! It's like eatting a raspberry when you expect it to taste like blueberry.Don Quixote's my favorite of all of them."
negative,"Bad sound - no bass: The sound quality is so bad...especially when volume level is increased...no equalizer options so can't adjust the bass, treble etc.,No holes to hang somewhere....poor design so it just rolls out if I try to place in a table....And it looks like eyes of some alien from mars....so bright blue light, disturbing eyes at night...pluses are quick delivery and cheap cost....I am using it to hear audio books...(and for music I bought an some other product).....Best option is to put some +20$ and go for some popular + good speakers available in the market...If you want to hear good music with decent bass + treble + balance...it is not worth..."
positive,Macally Macintosh Powerbook adapter: I have purchased three of these adapters and they work well. They will charge a G4 Powerbook while the unit is running. All 3 have worked without problem (sometimes the cord comes loose so you have to check that it is tight). No LED on the connector to indicated charging as with the original Apple adapter. Won't work on the new Intel MacBook or MacBook Pro.
positive,"Gladiator: I bought this on the review of another. I have always loved movies in the Roman, Moses and Cleopatra times. This one also proved to be a worthy buy. The movie did not drag for one minute as it kept your attention at all times. If you looked away you would miss something.I really good movie!!"
negative,"STOP think don't do it: Don't use this crap in a newer engine. My 03 Nissan has been going through oil. I put this into my car and within 5 miles, failure. Car stalled and would barely run. Had to have the oil & filter changed including diagnostic time $85 shot."
positive,"Never gets old: Still as good as the first timeI read it - oh so long ago, when middle earth was young"
positive,"TEACHER'S HELPER: I bought this to have on my desk at school and it is an excellent quick reference to hold my seating chart, lesson plans, class schedule, school calendar, meeting calendars...as well as many other things. I have been meaning to try this method of organization for years, and I have to say that I LOVE it."
positive,"A well written elementary QM text.: David Griffiths concentrates on the classic and important QM proplems, such as the Schrodinger equation, the finite square well, the delta function potential, the hydrogen atom, spin, etc. He does not touch on QM ""side line"" issues. Thus the students efforts are most efficient. Griffiths develops each subject in a balanced and easy to understand way. His book could be home studied without assistance from an instructor, which is certainly not true of many QM texts. The exercises are well selected and appropriate, and many of them have implicit or explicit answers provided. Along with QM by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, I would rate this one of the best choices for the beginning student. While Cohen-Tannoudji is comprehensive and elegant, Griffiths is basic and focused."
negative,"MISLEADING DESCRIPTION: The description on the website says it has an 11-inch dome, that's why I was willing to pay the high premium for the cake stand. But when it arrived I carefully measured the dome and it was only 10-inches. You can get a 10-inch one and it cost LESS THAN HALF as much (search ""diner cake stand""). DON'T FALL FOR IT!"
negative,"Keurig won't fool me twice.: Most of the five-star reviews on here appear to be from people who've owned their Keurig for a week or two. Yes, mine worked great back then. After about 9 months, averaging less than one cup per day (clearly not over-use) mine started ""short-cupping"". I have experienced the same poor results as others utilizing the telephonic customer service suggestions. My unit does fine when I run straight water through it, but it doesn't have the oomph to force water through the K-cups, and the backflow dribbles the water back into the reservoir. Clearly this is a pump problem, not a plugged line. Mine has passed the warranty period now, so I am simply going to resurrect my Hamilton Beach Brew Station which still works well after many more cups than the Keurig ever did. The Keurig cost three times as much but didn't last a year. No, there will not be a 2nd Keurig in my home, let alone a 3rd or 4th! Buy one if you dare, but don't expect it to last beyond a year."
negative,"The worst book i have ever read in my Life: This is quite simply the worst story i have ever read in my life.It was depressing, LONG, and meandered its way aimlessly till the end. Whats worse, the book could have ended half way and still had the same impact. The character still meets the same fate, everyone would have felt the same way, and the reader would have been spared several chapters of agonizing reading had she made a different choice after confessing her secret to Angel.If you like reading a depressing story where it seems like the author is taking sadistic joy in tormenting the protagonist, this is the story for you. For everyone else, stay far far away."
negative,"The Grammy awards don't matter: The Grammies really don't make a difference. look who was nominated - Shania Twain, Madonna, Backstreet Boys...and Lauryn Hill. Go figure, the committee has poor taste in music. You have to understand that in order to receive a nomination, your album must have sold at least a million copies.Nothing special about this album at all, it sounds just like any other hip hop/R&B album. ""Doo Wop"" is incredibly overrated and overplayed, right down to Lauryn's own Busta Rhymes knockoff in the song. ""To Zion"" and the title track among others make this album quite a drag.If you want to hear a truly amazing album, check out the latest releases by Leah Andreone, Sprung Monkey...or, better yet, the greatest album in the '90s, ""Fantastic Planet"" by Failure. They will truly knock your socks off...this won't."
negative,"This edition is full of errors, mistakes, and typos: DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!! It is full of typos, missing information in problems, mislabeled diagrams, and wrong answers! I spoke with PR and they said that, yes, indeed that is correct, but the 2002 edition has been corrected. Can you imagine what I went through while studying? I was second guessing myself left and right. I finally realized that, no, I do what I'm doing, it's the book that was wrong.Please don't buy this 2000 edition, it is a waste of your time and money. The 2002 edition ought to be much better, and probably quite a good study guide. I, however, have not seen it and do not know for sure, but PR should be a fairly respectable test prep. company.Happy GREs...hahaha"
positive,"An Excellent Gift: I was given this book as a Christmas gift by a very good friend. She is American, I'm a Scot and, at first, I wondered why she was sending me a book called Inheriting Scotland. Then it dawned on me, my friend was one of the authors of the series of interconnected stories which make up this book.On boxing day I sat down and read the book and I can say - and this from one who is steeped in Scottish folklore - that I enjoyed it immensely. All of the different authors jell together so well that the tale seems seamless. Of course I enjoyed Janet's contribution, but also I thought that that 'The Inheritance' episodes were very well done, and held the book together, and I also very much enjoyed 'The Corbie's Nest' and 'The Luck of the Sixpence'.I thoroughly recommend this book to all readers with a love of Scotland, and a bit of mystery, intrigue and romance."
positive,A Big Smile: I bought this book as a gift for my daughter. She was thrilled when she opened it. We had been looking for this book in local bookstores and was unable to find it here. I should of looked at amazon a long time ago. Thank you for helping me to make my daughters christmas a little brighter.
negative,"It's a piece...: Oh the problems I have had... (note that I only use the B side of the unit ) ...1. frequent auto-reboots. Yep, it resets itself at random...2. very limited range... walk into the kitchen => no signal3. limited compatibility... Had to replace a few cards ( MS & SMC work & can be found cheap )4. the wireless connection seems to slow to a halt... you can still pull an ip and browse the internet (at circa 2400 baud speeds)... a reset of the unit fixes this momentarily, but considering you have to either a) walk to the unit and push a button or b) slowly load it's config page and do it -- it's not worth the hassle.Do like me and buy something else... something with all good reviews."
positive,"Incredibly Beautiful: Although meant to be a children's book, this visually stunning work can be appreciated by people of all ages. Ed Young weaves calligraphy, collage, and the written word together in a most incredible way, through the theme of 'the heart'.I discovered this book about a year ago at a history teachers' conference. This year I purchased my own copy and was told at the time that someone had just purchased it for a wedding (shower) gift. What a great idea!"
positive,Great movie: Who does not like all the transformer movies? Great special effects everytime. Worth buying and watching several times. Does not get ld watching.
positive,"Measure of a Man measures up: Measure of a Man is one of those rare CDs where every single song is worth listening to! A mix of uptempo pop and ballads, this CD provides a range of styles to showcase Clay Aiken's amazing talents and prove once and for all, that he is a true pop superstar.I'll be listening to this one until my player wears out!"
negative,"Incredible Music, Poor Packaging: This contains some of the greatest music of all time, especially in the form of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""I Am The Walrus"". However, compared to the original lavish LP packaging, the CD packaging is a mere shadow. Capitol should upgrade this CD and include the original packaging elements as well as perhaps some background information about this important music."
negative,"Probably the worst film I've ever seen: Not quite sure why I watched this all the way through - really wish I hadn't. Full of cliches and incredibly predictable. The chemistry between the two leads was good, but the rest was pure crap. Sorry, those who worked on this film. Just my opinion."
negative,"Broken after a few uses: Filter is a little narrow, but it worked fine until I unscrewed it during the third use. Perhaps I overtighted it, but it was a little hard to unscrew from the lens. When it finally came off, the two glass pieces separated. Unfortunately I wasn't able to reassemble the two pieces, so I tossed them in the trash and thought to myself, ""That's what I get for [...]."""
positive,"How public opinion is shaped by movies to support power cla: Images manufactured with the intent of directing public opinion to support adventurers and profiteers is the tragic central theme of this novel. Our nation is in the hands of rascals and criminals, but as long as the pictures are pleasing and square with some melodramatic logic, the great unwashed stay quiet. It's enough to make you weep."
positive,Grandson LOVES this DVD: Thank you for the prompt delivery and it was in great condition. My grandson loves it! Thanks!
negative,"Not the best: I had great expectations when I picked this book up from the store last month. This book is okay, but certainly not ""the best"" as many claim. My suspicion is that people on this review site tend to be a small but determined bunch of supporters. The biggest flaw is that the book is boring. It truly is difficult to keep turning the page. After being 1/2-way through, I just had to toss the book out. If you scroll through the ""real"" reviews, you will find this is a common lament. Also, it doesn't have the same emotional life as ""The Lord of the Rings"" and does not draw one in. Dune is certainly not in the same league as Tolkien's works."
negative,"This is the WORSE book I've ever read.: I feel that its my civil duty to warn people not to waste their hard earned money and precious time reading this book. I bought this book based upon the author's name. I LOVED her first novel, and thought this would be along the mystery, emotion and suspense would be of the same level. Instead, I found myself half-way through the novel wondering if I should discard it, or hope for the best. It takes forever to start, the characters, once developed are so flawed and unlikable that it simply turns to a disappointment. The ""good"" guys turn into a new form of ""bad"". BTW, this is a murder mystery, and when she finally gets to wrapping it up, the ending and the motive for the murder are swept under the carpet. You are more then welcome to try to get through this horrid novel, but again, I highly recommend spending your time and money on either her first novel, or something new altogether."
negative,"Wrong Stuff: Product not as pictured. Ordered the Silicone Personal Lubricant as shown but received the Gel.The original stays slippery for a long time, enhancing the wife's pleasure.Gel gets sticky and is a turn-off for her."
negative,"Moon in my Room?: The text fights off any sensible reader and answers the question, ""If kids are afraid of bears, what are bears afraid of?"" with a simple example: cloying rhymes.Illustrations are very cute, making me wonder if this was designed as a TV show that didn't quite make it to the tube."
positive,"Breaking of the new wave: Breathless - in it's lean, pared down, gritty realism - is a seminal movie. Michel Poiccard (Jean Paul Belmondo) is a disaffected youth, a sort of French James Dean, who steals a car, shoots a policeman, then goes on the run. Whilst trying to track down money he is owed so he can escape to Italy, he pursues his affair with the beautiful, bird like Patricia by breaking into her hotel room. In a memorable, drawn out scene, the two lovers flirt and fight amongst the pillows, discussing the deeply philosophical and the trite and trivial. The dialogue sequence in this scene is a superb piece of cinematic realism. The detail of Breathless - Michel's white shirt and Bogart style cigarette and hat combo, Patricia's striped dresses, he city of Paris, a sharp jazz score, the doomed forebodings of noir - raise this film up to its position as Flicks magazine puts it: the yardstick of celluloid cool."
positive,"Moby.: You'll Want to PLAY it over & over again....: Reading through Moby's collection of short essays included in the MOBY'S ""PLAY"" CD booklet, you feel Moby's perspective on mood, depth, and inner peace. Especially, the piece on MOBY'S PLAY CD Track # 3: Porcelain. Buddhists should be aware of Moby's diveristy and interest in preserving his choice of living a life in devotion to the inner spirit and awareness of himself. Moby is a vegetarian after I read through his CD's booklet, I learned what kind of person he was. His music talks to the spirit and provides a sense of inner peace. I highly recommend this album to those who are interested in thoughtful and question answering music. Moby is truly a talented individual who seeks inner peace within himself and share this music with the world. Beautiful music!"
positive,"Beauty, love, adventure, pain - all here: Loved this series, seems like forever. My view of a deity I could speak to and not flinch from , came of this world... go read it and you'll see why.Everyone else told you about the characters and world. I think I memorized huge parts of this book before I even knew I was doing it. That's how special it is.IF you want another bit of this world, she wrote a story honoring Andre Norton [Moonsinger's World?] with a Rodmistress who always makes me cry. And that's not all bad, either. Won't even let my mother keep this book long, and part of why is Diane's story!You'd also love her beings in ""So you want to be a wizard"" series. That's going on book 5 now. Haven't read that yet, but I will, and I know I'll love it.To all my fellow readers who've been there in your hearts - may the Goddess hold you in Her hand..."
positive,Fresh Prince Will: I love the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and was happy to add to my collection season 5. I will look to add season 6 soon.
negative,"One Star....All For Jiminy Cricket!: That's right, you heard me! I hate this movie! I used to give it two stars, or maybe even three, but over time it just got worse to me.One of the many misunderstandings about this film is that it is a kids' movie....when I was a little kid, I found it quite scary, depressing, and even disturbing (the scene where the boy turns into a donkey still sends shivers up my spine).However. . . . . . Jiminy Cricket should've won an Oscar! He is the true heart and soul of the film. He is very, very funny!!! Some might say that Pinocchio is the best. But he comes off as an idiotic little brat/punk. And supporting Oscar to Cleo the cat! He's awesome! I hate the goldfish, however!All those who say this is one of Disney's best: BAH HUMBUG!"
negative,"To shave is to conquer.: Disapponting. This hairy film uselessly battles the common fur-generated fears/attractions. It's the typical beauty-and-the-best dynamic, but with a solid representation of the art of shaving."
negative,"So overrated it hurts: Wow, we've really been conditioned to settle for less, haven't we? This is a dumb comic book movie with fake special effects, corny acting and that geek Tobey Maguire. For a real comic book movie, check out George Clooney in the awesome ""Batman and Robin."""
positive,"Great CD: Love Regina's work, love Jazz. I am a violinist and love hearing the violin played in different genre's love what she does"
negative,"Tresure Island: ""Treasure island"" was a hard book to understand at my age (12). Its sentences were written in old English, which got you confused. The sentences were also pretty long. There word choice was hard and confusing. On page 118 the 4th sentence has like three hard words. The description was good but at times the plot was confusing. A significant event that happened was when the mutineers attacked their ship and killed Flint.My personal opinion of this book is I thought it was bad and hard to understand. It was written so far back that the old English was so confusing. It seemed like there were like ten different things happening at one time. So a good age for a reader of this book would be around thirteen and up. Twelve year olds could read it to if you're a good reader. But if your not that great of a reader than you might think the book is confusing like I did. So all in all, I would give the book a three on a one through ten scale."
negative,"Good on the what, weak on the why: Given this is not apologetics, an overload of what is done, with continual references to the lifelong study required, I felt I did not know much more about the reasons behind the liturgical rites and the precepts of this religion than I did before starting this book."
positive,"kewl!: The movie the Odessey was a very very good movie. It was very well writen and acted out. I saw this movie during my History class at school. The actors did and axcellent job in acting out this movie. They made me feel like I was in the movie with them the whole time. My favorite god was Aeolus. He was very funny. Odysseus was played by Armand Assante. He was a very good actor. My favorite part in the whole movie is when Odysseus and Teemachus kill all of the kings that had come to marry Odysseus' wife, Penelope. The only thing wrong with the whole movie was the sexual content. There was no nudity but there were a few love seens. The special effects are awesome. But there are a few boring parts when the people were talking."
positive,Lens Cap: This lens cap works good. It is of good quality and fits my camera lens filter with no problem. I put it on my Canon SX40 with with this size adapter and filter.
negative,"Y can i not rate anything a zero!!!: This cd is nothing but talentless crap, the only good song is sick little suicides, the rest of the cd is no more then a joke, they try to be like NOFX and they cannot pull it off at all, they suck so much ass, i hate this band and would never support the shows they play or them for that matter, crap crap crap is the best way to describe this cd!!!"
negative,"This was the worst toy I have ever purchased: This was awful. I guess you get what you pay for!!!!! When we opened for the grand daughters to pay with Christmas Eve, the teeth was sticking and there was no excitement. I was suppose to snap it did nothing."
positive,"It's Just The Best: When I was little, this is the first movie I remember seeing. Again and again. Every time I saw it, I would laugh, cry, and swear that someday I would own a copy. I finally do, and it has not changed. I have every line memorized, every song (and they are wonderful, to whoever wrote that top review), every little nuance . . . it is so much a part of me that I cannot imagine what I would be like if I had never seen it. Different, and probably worse. Believe it or not, this wonderful child's tale of magick and monsters and True Love does have a moral and lessons. If you have children and haven't shown them The Last Unicorn yet, be sure to soon. It's too good to pass up!"
negative,"save your money: really awful movie. The main character was completely without expression or emotion. The climactic fight scene was so completely ""out there"" that you might believe you stumbled into Shrek outtakes. Honestly, what barn has over 20 ladders?"
positive,"Welcome back Robin !: My first listen to "" Go my Way "" was like a visit from an old friend. From the title track's first note I was hooked.This is an excellent effort. Robin's unique tones are here with some fresh twists.His vocals are a great suprise to me.From ""Go my way"" to ""In my dream"" this cd or... should I say album ? rocks.This harkens back to any of his great seventies work without sounding dated.If you are a fan of Trower's or a fan of great guitar, buy this.Welcome back Robin.....We missed you !"
negative,"Please!: This was a horride movie. It had some creepy sceans, but the story was flater than paper. This proves that a movie doesn't need special effects to be scary. I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" and that was much better (And more scary) than this movie. Don't waste your money."
negative,"The Story of King Arthur (Kindle ed. ASIN B002LITTW4): I love the the tales of King Arthur & his knights and was really looking forward to reading this on my new Kindle. Alas, it was not even worth the price of $0.99. The ebook formatting is terrible, with pieces of random sentences stuck in the middle of others, making it impossible and very frustrating to read. It is illustrated and the illustrations are beautiful, but still, Definitely not worth it!"
positive,The Bible Made Easy: A Book-by-book Introduction: A quick and easy way to get to know the Bible. Now to go through and study what I found interesting. Can find the real story now and not just passed on legends.
positive,"A wonderful book on two levels: This book is not only an exciting adventure story, but a chilling parable for the depths of human nature. I hope all school schildren get the chance to read annd discuss this graet novel as I did. Keep your eye out for great literary devices!"
negative,Not what was pictured: Speed square that is pictured has black outline on all lettering. What I recieved has no outlining on lettering. Very hard to read. Very disappointed in product.
negative,"A cheap case with issues: I picked this case up in order to fly several handguns home. I had to drill out the handle to accept a more substantial lock. I ended up using a brinks adjustable shackle lock straight through the handle. I loaded it up with 5 handguns in gun socks. TSA had no issue with the case as modified. It rolled out on the conveyor at my destination cracked completely through, bottom corner to case buckle and was missing a 1""x2"" chunk out of the bottom at that location. Seeing how it failed I would not recommend this case for hard use, the plastic used is just too brittle and the lock location is a joke. Invest a bit more in a better case. Plano has replaced the damaged case at no charge, which says a lot about their customer service."
negative,Not what it claimed to be: The pic was so small - couldn't see that it was exclusively screws - no nuts at all. I didn't lose my screws - I lost a nut on my glasses. How can you send out an eye class repair kit with no nuts? Please send me some nuts for my eye glasses.
positive,"Great Airbed: I looked at several airbeds before buying this one. I looked at several name brands, I was not familiar with Intex so I checked the reviews and am glad I did. Fast delivery, easy set up (a must for me) and a very sturdy product. We are completely satisfied with this bed. The built in pump is easy to use and works perfectly. We bought the twin due to space but intend to buy a larger bed to have on hand."
positive,"Great Soundtrack: I just got back from seeing The Polar Express and I really loved the movie & the music.The song ""When Christmas Comes To Town"" will end up being a classic.Happy Holiday's!!!!!"
negative,"Most Overrated Book In Literary History: Why people claim to enjoy this book I'll never know. The writing style doesn't flow, the characters aren't particularly all that well developed, and the storyline isn't all that interesting. This is a prime example of what happens when Star Trek and Star Wars dorks pick up a book. They see the word ""wizard"" or ""dragon"" and get all gooey with excitement and think it's great literature."
positive,"Pretty Teriffic: We bought this in Grand Teton Nat'l Park last fall. One could tritefully refer it to cocktail lounge music, but if the cocktail lounge were located in one of the most magnificent of America's parks with the view of the Grand Tetons, then I'd say it would be an appropriate description.There's a sense of the grandur of the Tetons in the music.Since buying this, the music has grown on me to the point where I play it at home on a frequent basis.I particularly enjoy the quality of the recording. The lower registers of the piano are captured, as is a sense of space.I like it so much, I was looking to see what else she has produced. Does that say enough?"
positive,"I can't stop laughing!: Charlie's Great Adventure is one of the funniest books I've ever read. Charlie is this amazing cat, and he tells the story in the first person, so you feel like you are Charlie. Imagine seeing what the whole world looks like from down on the floor where a cat is. Charlie manages to get into all kinds of trouble, and how he gets out of each situation is what is so funny. I liked it so much that I read it to my 5 year old brother, and he actually rolled on the floor he was laughing so hard.This is a great book. I definitely recommend it to everyone."
positive,"Two Versions: The buyer should be aware that there was an Australian printing of his book, and an abridged version printed in the US. The US version is a bit over half the size of the original version. I had to order this book from a used book store in Australia in order to get the original version. This is the definitive book on the Coast Watchers. Feldt gives the different locations, names, problems, and outcome including the period after Guadalcanal where he had a heart attack and was replaced. Other very good books that cover the Coast Watchers include ""Fire Over the Islands"" by Horton, ""Alone on Guadalcanal"" by Clemens, ""Hunted"" by Murray and ""Lonely Vigil"" by Lord. The bibliographies of these books will lead you to a dozen or so more. Some are only available in Australian or English used book stores.These men were courageous and under terrible conditions managed to keep their equipment operational."
positive,"Classic Christmas Movie: Cute holiday classic with a lot of perfect elocution and flashy costumes. Oh, and some somersaults along with bored wealthy folks and the traditional theme of getting married."
negative,the worst halloween: this is the worst halloween movie michael myers is not even in it it has nothing to do with the first two its not like it is the same story its a diffrent story and a diffrent type of horror the first two were slashers this one is sci fi it has one or two good parts but it is really bad skip this one watch the rest the first halloween is one of the best films ever made if you like horror movies i reccomend you the first halloween
negative,"Avoid this best seller: I selected this book based on being a best seller, and personal interest in anthropology and history. Unfortunately, the book has little focus. It is hard to tell whether this is an anthropology survey, critique current anthropology research, or the authors personal travels. The reading is very slow and tedious. For me the book went too far when when drawing connections between a current day tortilla shop with pre-columbian peoples. I had to call it quits after 200 pages into the book. The reading is agonizingly slow, and includes assumptions with little or no supporting evidence. Based on this book I no longer rely on best seller lists."
positive,"Quickly outgrown - best for 1-3 year olds: I purchased this climber/swing for my 2 year old twin daughters (a couple years ago). We have a large Cedar Works wooden play structure (highly recommended - no splinters!) purchased for their older brother but I thought they would need a smaller transitional climber. I was wrong. They wanted to play with big brother so went right for the wood play structure. They all still use this occasionally (ages 3.75, 3.75 and 7 now) but it is pretty small for them. I would suggest this for 1-3 year olds and only if they don't have an older sibling and bigger play structure to entice them. It is low to the ground, providing easy access to a new walker. It went together quickly and relatively easily and has held up very well, even with a 7 year old climbing on the roof."
positive,"good quality!: This is a great tee shirt. It's good quality, and the size is true, and you certainly couldn't beat the price! I do love the gold box sales!"
negative,HAS EVERYONE GONE MENTAL!: THIS MOVIE STUNK IN SUCH A MAJOR WAY THAT I WANTED TO BLOW MY T.V. UP WHEN THIS PIECE OF JUNK FILM WAS OVER. AND FOR THOSE OUT THERE WHO THINK THIS IS GOOD. I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YA. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SMOKING?
negative,"Godinger Silver Pineapple Crystal Gravy Boat: This gravy bowl is pictured with a ladel. The reason I chose this item is because it came with a ladel. But, guess what, the picture is false advertising because it does not contain a ladel. Huge disappointment! Why not just show a picture of the bowl without the ladel???"
positive,"Music for Australia's Soul: I also discovered the Uluru CD during my first trip to Australia. Although I now have several of O'Connor's CDs this remains my favorite. His music as composed for specific locations (Marnier is also a 5 star in my book) truly captures the soul of the locations for which they are composed. For me they invite an instant trip back in time to a treasured visit. In Uluru, others will find he captured the very essence of the Red Center; though some may simply enjoy the peaceful elegance of the music."
positive,"If a book is a meal, this is Thanksgiving: Few booka are as gripping, confounding, and ultimately satisfying as this vast novel. A true MUST READ for anyone serious about English literature or looking to grow a few new brain cells. Easily one of my favorites."
positive,"All round excellence: The story line is great, as most people who buy this product know. It is, therefore, refereshing to find that the digital transfer is really excellent too, certainly one of the best if not the best I have so far purchased. The colors and detail are crisp and clear, as is the sound. This is a must if you loved the orginal film."
positive,"helped me get a little further: I have a few races under my belt but am not exactly a seasoned runner, I found this book to be very helpful in improving my form. It won't help you immediately get faster, or add miles, and you must train to get the benefits from it. However, I don't thinkI would have made the improvements that I did without it."
negative,Stupid movie with no plot: This sequel should have been left on the shelf. Brendan Fraser did terrible.
positive,"A Fine Work: Romeo and Juliet is the first Shakespearean play I have read. I thought it was very good. It didn't have a complicated plot like other Shakespearean plays allegedly have. The language, of course, is great. I would also recommend buying this edition of the book if any, because old and archaic words and phrases are translated on every other page (this is a huge help). Shakespeare offers some good comic relief (watch for several double entendres) throughout the play which moderated the level of lament. This play shows the chaos that can result when people let their emotions overcome reason, and also what can result when you only look short term and move with so much ""haste"". After finishing the play, I realized that there were indeed only a couple of totally reasonable characters, but I'll leave that to you. I look foward to reading more of Shakespeare's plays in the near future."
negative,"Really, really bad: I usually like Brit humor, but this movie just wasn't funny at all. Very bad script. I found it tedious and boring. A lot of scenes went on for too long. (I fast-forwarded through some of them.) The gross-out stuff is better left to Americans. It seemed like the actors were uncomfortable with the material and I felt sorry for them. I lasted maybe an hour and gave up. I'm sorry I wasted a Netflix rental on crap like this. I think I'll skip the USA remake."
negative,"Frightful: This book. What can I say? If the theology/morality wasn't so pointless, affectated and plain ridiculous (more on that in a second), it would still be a crime against humanity on the part of the publishers.The writing style is banal, flat and unimaginative, the characterisation is poorly thought out and unbelievable (Dairine suddenly transforms into a different person halfway through the book, and the parrot/goddess...don't get me started. Nita and Kit are as they always were, in their ways and in their relations with each other, and the Lone Power, unbelievably, goes through a completely ludicrous character change.) Also, it has a falsely sentimental overtone, the jokes are childish and- well, it just ... all round.About the theology. It's just rehashed Judeo-Christian philosophy with a little boring physics and calculus thrown in. Pu-lease.In short, just read something else."
positive,"Wow, Great CD!: I've been a SCOTS fan a long time. I've seen them many times live, and have purchased most of their music. I get a little frustrated with their ""White Trailer-Trash"" persona because I think it detracts from the fact that their a great rock and roll band. Rick's surf'n swamp guitar work just gets better along with the rest of the band.Thats why I dig this new album so much. I seems like the band really put some time and effort into this disc. Hearing them play The Kinks 'Muswell Hillbilly' and making it their own is a beautiful thing. Rick Miller tearing into 'Tombstone Shadow', awesome. Makes me wish they would do a whole album of Creedence covers! The whole band is really on the same wave-length playing each one of these diverse tunes. Its a shame that 'Walk Like a Camel' was their biggest hit. They deserve a much wider audience. Great Disc."
negative,"Verbose: I feel like the message of the book is good and useful... but this could have been an essay instead of a 250 page book. Boys aren't encouraged to explore their emotions, which leads to feelings being bottled up and ignored. This can lead to emotional problems in some boys. I didn't find their case studies to be very compelling or their conclusions to be particularly helpful or actionable."
negative,Not a good book don't get it. It is really confusing: This book is really confusing. I got lost a lot in it. It doesn't really make any sense and it is kind of a band book.
positive,"Take the audio version along on your next long trip.: My 10 and 11 year old children Quieltly listened to this tape for 6 hours on our last day long drive. My wife and I too found the story very engrossing, funny and a good look at life in the early 1900's."
negative,"birthday present: Ordered this for my husbands birthday because I really liked the idea of the putt return. Received the item, and the mechanism just clicks. We followed the directions and sent a second ball down and tried rearranging it, but still didn't work. Called customer service to try to get an exchange, but of six phone calls (and leaving messages) was only able to reach one person who said they'd get back to me within the hour...it's now been 3 days and I still can't get a hold of anyone. I will now return this and not get an exchange just in case something happens with the next one...that is if I can get a hold of someone!"
negative,"Thumbs down: Smallville 9 is a loser the entire season, not merely a few episodes. ""Kneel Before Zod"" is a thorougly unlikeable character; I think I would dislike even the person behind the portrayal, as the British accent is just so totally alienating. Season Nine is the ""chick-flic"" year: close-up on Zoe's recovery from those awful awful episodes with the mumbler Jimmy Olsen and the whiner David Bloom; and, of course, the heavy panting of the sexually-starved Lois Lane.I am ready to admit that Smallville lost its vitality by the end of season 7."
negative,"Shameless stupidity: Stupid, moronic, idiotic. I'm twelve. This is the stupidest fantasy I've read in a long time. You other young readers make me sick."
negative,"Bland And Forgettable.: I watched about thirty minutes of this movie and turned it off. The plot was totally silly and I can't figure out why a movie this trite would be released. Home Fries just wasn't any good. I admit that I didn't watch all of the movie, but when I have to turn it off, that's ample reason to rate it on the low spectrum. Try something else besides this."
positive,My son loved Mooch.: Mooch arrived safe and sound. My son loves him. We already have one Mooch but each child wanted their own.
negative,silk ? Realy ?: This is NOT silk but cheep plastic . It looks cheep and is cheep . sorry I ever bought it as its going in the trash
negative,"Good clock, terrible radio: The clock, display, and alarm features are all good. The radio, however, overrides these benefits with poor reception. All stations come in with static. So when you wake to radio at low volume levels, the static competes with your ability to enjoy music, news, or weather reports.I finally gave up and have replaced the unit with another manufacturer in the same price range. I will not have the smartset time, but I will be able to listen to the radio or news with clear reception."
negative,"Disappointing: Great book, awesome topic, engaging interviews and cool live footage -- so, why was the movie so disappointing? Maybe it's because it was so disjointed and never put the various scenes in context (especially chronological context). Maybe it's because nearly every interviewee said the same thing -- all fans of hardcore punk were losers/outcasts (not true!), the scene was a reaction against the oppressive climate in the early '80s, including Fleetwood Mac, disco, ""coke snorting Hollywood types"" (these parts made me cringe -- so did the interviews with guys like Keith Morris, who reveal themselves in their old age to be inarticulate burnouts). I agree with the other posts as well -- no DKs? no Misfits? no Husker Du?. It's like Hardcore for Dummies, but since the movie never scratches below the surface and never presents the material in a coherent manner, even dummies won't be any smarter about the topic after watching it! Hopefully, someone will do it right one day."
negative,"Letdown: When i first heard of the possibility of a star blazers dvd i was quite excited.Unfortunately once i received it,i was throughly disappointed.Even though the original program was quite old,voyager could have done a much better job here.They cut corners to save money.Even some of the poorest vcd's have better video and sound quality than this dvd edition.You would do yourself much better to buy the current video tapes that are out there.As long as you have a halfway decent vcr,you'll do much better than this dvd edition.Keep your eye out for the japanese edition dvd's.I'm sure they are coming,if they aren't out already.They won't cut corners at the expense of quality.Save your money and spend it on some other anime dvd's like sol bianca.(Don't waste your money on the funimation dragonball z dvds,or the evangelion dvd's either.Their quality is almost bad as this)"
negative,"Do not purchase: I purchased this item after reading reviews. Using the directions for roasting in the microwave the garlic was burnt to a crisp, the smell lingered for days. I immediately threw this garlic roaster in the trash. I will use foil and bake in the oven. What a waste of money."
positive,"The girl simply shines with the 4 guys!!!! wow: Okay, let's be objective, A NEW DAY HAS COME was a fine album, ONE HEART was simply the crappiest Celine album ever, but now she brings us this piece of art for those who appreciate her french music .. her roots. This album was targeted mainly for french and Canadian people, but it's topping the charts all over Europe, because of its quality!It is a musical piece of art which combines folk with blues and some irish shades. With tremendous guitar arrangements played by the amazing Gildas Arzel each song turns into a living nostalgia.Her voice is relaxed as it's never been, and she doesn't try to force it to hit high notes.. she just sings with her heart.even if u don't speak french, u'll love this album for its musicality!!!!!!!!! GO AND BUY IT -WON'T REGRET"
positive,"Fast shipping, works great: We had to match existing garage door openers, needed 15 more for condo complex. They arrived on time, new, and worked perfectly. thanks"
positive,"Stunning: I saw this move once when I was very young, and for the longest time I couldn't find anyone else who had seen it. I almost wasn't sure I really had seen a movie called ""The Last Unicorn."" Then, joy of joys, several years later I happened upon the tape, and watched it again. It was twice as good as I'd remembered. This is the type of movie you can't get out of your head. It's just absolutely stunning. The only reason I can't give it the 5 stars is because no movie could ever equal Peter s. Beagle's heart-breakingly beautiful, yet hilarious book. Nothing could come closer than this."
negative,didnt last: This heat gun died on me last week after 7 months. I used it within the manufacturers guidelines and it just died.
negative,Not for iBook G4: Be careful. The box packing for this says it works with a PowerBook G4 or an iBook G3. It will not work for a iBook G4. The Amazon product page does not make that clear.
negative,"Ok with some design problems: Am trying to make due with it since I purchased. It's overpriced by $7 compared with the Spartan Sports Talking Pedometer (almost the same product except different colors for plastic). The stride mechanism also sticks occasionally and I have to shake the device to get it to work.I agree with previous comments - there are some problems. It's too easy to accidentally press the button on top that turns on the very annoying music, and it's too easy to accidentally press the button on top that turns the alarm on, and it's too easy to accidentally press the big button on the front that will speak the number of steps and distance you've walked."
negative,"Bad Computer...Nice Screen: Bad Computer................BLUE SCREEN MANIA.""BREATHES HEAVY""...........OVERALL.BAD COMPUTER....DONT DO IT TO YOUR SELF."
negative,Everybody associated with the movie deserves condemnation: It has taken me twenty five years and I think I have forgotten everything about this. Perversion of the play by turning the characters into little children.This is one of the worst movies ever and Richard Attenborough is a major reason. No understanding of the play.
positive,Good book.: My wife is taking this class using tis book as their text book. She likes it.It might be better if a audio CD can be added to it.
negative,God's and kings: This is a very needed message for the children of God today. Do not give in to temptation as it will multiply and lead you on a path away from God.
positive,"Teresa is a master of fairy tales...a dream come true.: I'm always into Smantha James, Lisa Kleypas or Cathy Maxwell's books, yet, once in a while I would like to have a little change in my taste, so I tried Teresa Medeiros's books for the 1st time. ""Yours Until Dawn"" was my 1st choice in her collection, and I was really surprised the way she gives each character a fun and witty personality. She made the story seemed so alive, that I didn't want it to end, even though I read the book for the 2nd time. They way she writes always makes me laugh then cry, then cry and laugh again. It's really a treat reading one of her books. I recommned to anyone who is into fairy tales, or just plain romance books, you will not be dissapointed."
negative,"Self Indulgent Drivel: I thought the book was going to be a fun to read chronicle of a the author's cooking experiment. Wrong. She describes selling her eggs like someone else might describe holding a garage sale to raise a few extra bucks. When she described a very disturbing scene that involved a deranged woman deliberately and publically bashing her head into the concrete, and then managed to turn it into a self indulgent pity party for herself without skipping a beat, I closed the book and took it back to the library."
negative,"Formatting problems: The two stars refer of course not to the book but to its format. I recently acquired my first Kindle and thought I'd download some freebies to try it out. This one was quite disappointing, since the limericks it contains appear as continuous text, so are quite inconvenient to read. It's a wonderfully entertaining book to get in print form though!"
positive,Exactly Like My Original: I lost my original charger and bought this to replace it and it works just like the original. Very happy about this purchase!
positive,"I'm diggin' it: I had the opportunity to hear this record back in March when I visited Los Angeles. At that time, the master tapes were being flown to Atlanta so Brendan O'brien could mix the up-beat tunes (I guess Tchad feels fast songs are not his strong suit). I was kind of disappointed to see they kept only five of his original mixes. I personally love Tchad's mixing style and think they're much more unique. ""Rival"" is my favorite (that's Blake's dog). Overall, It's a great rock album."
negative,"Not Sure This Actually Works: I tried this brand of oil of oregano when the brand I usually buy only had the huge bottle available and I found that out of my price range.I wish I had splurged, though, because I don't think this product actually did anything; I didn't notice a difference in how i was feeling. I think it's worth it to buy the Gaia brand Oil of Oregano, instead."
positive,"a no nonsense straightforward little book: It's only been a short while since Cardinal Ratizinger became pope and when I bought it I expected it to be a quickie slapdash collection of articles. It's much better than that. Matthew Bunson touches on the days before JPII died and the outpouring of grief and love that occurred after his death. He gives a straightforward peek into the conclave proccess and finally introduces the reader to Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict 16.You will find a quick run down of Joseph Ratzinger's life and get an idea of just how much John Paul the II respected and relied on Benedict 16. If you didn't know who Cardinal Ratzinger was before or if you got your image of him from the knee jerk reactions of the media We Have a Pope is a very good place for the average soul in the back pews to start getting an idea of who the new Holy Father is."
negative,"Don't Buy with younger children: Purchased, installed batteries and returned. May be OK for 8 and above, but if you have younger children, don't buy. The cutter can puncture if held against skin. I now know what it must feel like to get a tattoo."
negative,"Not a Good Game!: I bought this game since I like racing games and though it would be fun, but when i played it, it sucked! Its not realistic, hard to control, and just plain stupid. I only played this game like twice and hated it so i recommend u dont buy it!"
positive,"anyone who works can relate to this movie!!!: this movie is great because even if you do not work in a office ,you can still relate to what is going on!!The film takes place in offices. I laughed the whole time. My favorite part is in the beginning when the main guy is commuting to work and the old man in the walker passes him up!!!Go get this movie even if you do not work you will still get some of the humor in this awesome movie about the relationships between employees and their employers)!"
negative,"Did Not Work!!: I acted like a super bitch -- and it didn't help! None of the tools designed to shift the parameters of a relationship provided in this book did much for me. Perhaps this book is aimed towards women interested in a different type of men, because I am sorry to say that the man I was dating saw through the tricks being pulled. After a number of dates, our relationship began falling apart as I was getting more bitchy and manipulative, as Sherry's book suggests. At first, the guy fell for it and was upset that I seemed to be losing interest in him. I did not want to see him heart-broken, but continued following the advice given as I wanted to maintain the relationship. But it didn't take long for him to catch on to what was actually happening. He said that my wonderful aura had been lost and said (really) that I was acting like a disgusting bitch. I hate this book!"
positive,"Eragon: In eldest, the sequel to Eragon, Murtaugh turns evil and it turns out he is Eragons brother. Remember Angelas' prediction? Eragon trains to be a rider under master Oromis, a dragon rider. Roran and the entire town of carvahall travels to the varden where roran kills the twins who are evil. Murtaugh and his dragon, Thorn beat up Eragon an Saphira in a climactic fight and then they take Za'roc. The Razaac fight Roran and he discovers their weakness and shares it with Eragon.Good book. I hope you enjoy it."
positive,"U DA MAN: THIS BROTHER IS TIGHT. MILES DAVIS TIGHT. YEAH, I INVOKED MILES. PAUL,YOU GOTTA KEEP BREATHIN.THE FIRST CUT WILL KICK YOUR A@#. I PLAYED THE FIRST CUT FOR FOUR HOURS. I WAS DANCIN IN MY SEAT. PEOPLE ON THE TRAIN KNEW I WAS CRAZY. I'M WAITIN FOR NAHOO 3. I HEARD IT'S OUT BUT NO-ONE SEEMS TO HAVE IT."
positive,"Dreamy, poignant and agitating.: After seeing Absinthe live about a year ago, I was anxious for a release. ""A Good Day to Die"" has surpassed my expectations. The music can be dreamy; the words can be poignant; and the general feel of this album can be agitating."
negative,"Yoda is in the next book . . .: Describe a rainstorm in 700 words or more, then continue like this for and entire novel. . .I would suggest that anyone considering reading this book just get the original or go rent the movie, it's called Star Wars. This novel followed that plot so closely that I checked the acknowlegements to see if it was intentional. I was shocked to see no mention of it at all. I was not shocked to find out Paolini's parents first published his work."
positive,Awesome!: This was the first novel I've read by Shari MacDonald. It was great. She ranks right up there with Lori Wick and Lori Copeland. This is a must read.
negative,"This HDMI cord is worthless: Do not waste your money on this HDMI cord, one day it just stopped showing the picture. It is poor quality and will break on you."
positive,"easy to read, a little to easy...: I wish that he had gone more into depth explaining strings, but that is not the kind of book it is. it is an overview on higher dimentions. but it is definitally fun to read. once you hear the story about him and his parents, a football feild, and 30 miles of wire... you will be on the floor."
negative,Not too useful without a functional pump!: The ball itself seems like it would be nice and sturdy -- unfortunately you need to actually put air into it. The accompanying pump is completely non-functional. The only exercise we are going to have with the GoFit Stability ball is the effort it takes to return it.Update a week later: OK...finally found a different pump and managed to inflate the ball. I have to say the quality of the GoFit Ball is excellent. But I leaving them with one star -- as the pump you are paying for should actually work!
negative,"What a piece of junk: We've had other toys by M&D, they've been very good. This one was an utter piece of garbage. The instructions printed using a cheap colour laser printer and the thus made it hard to identify the multitude of similarly shaped items that were in the box. A few of the included screws had heads that were not properly punched so the screw driver wouldn't bite. Several of the pieces were warped and if it wasn't because my son was looking at Daddy to assemble his new fire engine, I'd have thrown everything back in the box to return to Amazon. The main wooden frame that made up the chassis was glued on crooked, thus forcing the other parts to be forced to follow the contours. The bucket at the end of the ladder was loose, the included pin was too long and thus couldn't maintain any friction on the part. After a couple of days the knobs that are used to raise and lower the boom arm are free spinning, rendering them useless unless I glue them back on."
negative,"Terrible: I have no idea how they got the movie from this awful book. It had such potential, such a unique and interesting setting, but went nowhere, did nothing! Every time it seemed like the author was moving towards something interesting, some plot point or twist, she'd just let it DROP! None of her build-ups went anywhere, leaving the plot empty and pointless. She just let everything hang in the air with nowhere to fall. And then she tried to cover up her lack of writing ability by putting an f-bomb about every other page or so. I always thought the movie had a couple of little plot holes in it, but now I know what they were working from, and the movie totally SAVED this shallow story.This is one of the ONLY times I have ever liked the MOVIE more than the BOOK! Ordinarily, I would recommend a book over its film counterpart, but in this case, I would tell anybody to watch the movie and stay far away from the book! What a staggeringly disappointing novel."
negative,"Mistake: Comparing to '1968 George A. Romero's version, remake seems banal. That's the effect of changing the script. After watching the original Night Of The Living Dead watching remake is pointless: Savini is not as good director as Romero, and the tension is unfortunately not the same... What's good in this movie? Patricia Tallman as Barbra is truly charming, and make up of zombies is just excellent. But the script is, as i said, much worse than original and all movie is much less scary. There are pure american black&white characters, when in original characters were much more complicated (especially Ben and Barbra). So, if you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you to see NOTLD'1968 -Romero's original. I saw sequel before seeing original: it seemed really good to me, but when I saw Romero's version...I was shocked. Two different movies, two different classes. Anyway, it's worth to see Patricia Tallman using crowbar to fight...:)"
positive,"book review: I enjoyed this book far more than I expected to. I found myself reading until midnight to finish it. I remember those days and Brokaw captures the period extremely well which I would expect of his writing. The individual excerpts on Bob Dole, George Shultz. etc. was especially interesting."
positive,"Artistry: I think that the Deodato concerts are very rich, as he used real strings and band musicians, as well as you can appreciate the John Tropea excelent renditions on guitar."
positive,"It's a classic!: The Last Unicorn belongs in the homes of a collector or one simply looking for a good movie. The movie is also great for children with supervision. It is perfect for a family collection or to watch with children while babysitting. I have grown up with the thoughts of Unicorns prancing in my head; this movie dares to take those fanatasies to a new level. The Last Unicorn deals with many issues that can be used today, about self worth. The movie has humor, witt, and the capability of a universal story-line. The graphics are pleasing to the eye without beign overly complicated. I recommend it as a true classic that belongs in the homes of almost everyone."
positive,"Very good read: I like this book much better than her last book, Leopard Lord. The author was able to empathize Farris' feeling and captured it for the reader. The supporting characters were very well written, including Farris' masters and mistress. The story was good enough to make me feel that it truely happened. I feel the author has real talent, and I will definitely buy her next book."
positive,"Dierks Bentley Cd: I love every song on this CD...I love everything that Dierks does...I highly recommend his new CD Up ON The Ridge. I also highly recommend buying from amazon.com,they ship so fast...I love their service"
negative,"This book really isn't worth the money.: I am not a big fan of this book. If you subscribe to ""The Autograph Collector"" magazine, you would know that 80% of the magazine is advertisements, and you would think spending [money] on a book you wouldn't have 25 pages of ads. Also, many of the signatures in this book do not match signatures I have received in person. In stead of the ad's they should have used that extra 25 pages to list more examples of stars signatures, or at least list more people. I would suggest that they make the signatures themselves smaller, as many people are copying the signatures out of the book onto index cards and photos, and selling the forgeries on ebay. All together, I would suggest you buy a different book; this one is not even worth what you would pay for it used."
negative,"Even 1 star is generous: I dont like to give polarized reviews but could not resist after the crappy machine gave up for the 3rd time. More accurately: we've gone throug 3 units in 2 years and only received support on the first casualty. This 179 buck machine is truly built with the worst of quality standards. Issue range from drawing half the amount of water, shutting down in the middle of brewing to buttons that no longer respond and a display that died.Keurrig is very eager to take your money for this overpriced junk but when you need warranty support, then good luck getting a response and even if you get to them the fix is more expensive than the value of the machine.I am so tired of this overpriced system that we decided to whip out the ole Capresso machine and you know what: the coffee tastes better, is hotter and were are spanding sooooooo much less. K-cups are a gimmick and were embarrassed we got lured in. Eject."
positive,"A Bargain: I got this adapter for my Acer laptop which needed it's THIRD AC adapter replacement since I got it in 2004. After the first original Acer adapter failed I bought Targus ones for $100 that only lasted me a few months.I haven't had this as long as I've had the Targus adapters, but so far so good. The only thing is that the adapter is a little loose in the inlet.Other than that, it's a way better value than the $100 Targus ones."
negative,"This wallows in lameness!: The title of the review says it all. The characters are shallow and the situation is contrived. Reading the entire book was painful, and I would not have continued reading it if it wasn't a book club selection. Save your money and your time. Don't bother reading this book!"
negative,"Blah: This is the same stuff that the music industry keeps forcing down our throats. These guys need to get their own sound and stop stealing lyrics and riffs from sub-par, glam bands like Goo Goo Dolls and Matchbox 20.These guys are not good. I heard they broke up. Believe me, it was for the best. Thankfully, I will never have to listen to their music again."
negative,"Annoying.: Kids will like... for as long as it lasts. And it won't last long. I also found the way the basket attaches to the wheel base to become a cart annoying. The darn thing falls off all the time and eventually I threw it out. It just frustrated the kids at church nursery. Better off seeking a sturdier option. Even for a household with just one kid -- this thing is flimsy. It def. won't work for a situation where many kids will be using it (church nursery, preschool, etc.)"
negative,"The truth about the song, Wipe Out: This review is in response to Mr. Bogdanov's book, with the featured Amazon link to p. 557 concerning the song, Wipe Out:* Excerpt from page 557 ""... and arrangement stolen by the Surfaris, who had a huge hit ...""Unfortunately, this is suggestive, and thus misleading information concerning the song, written and recorded by the Surfaris in 1962. The four members in the studio that December night were Ron Wilson, Pat Connolly, Jim Fuller and Bob Berryhill. This is a well-known fact, legally proven beyond any doubt. Anyone claiming that the Surfaris stole Wipe Out from them is sadly disillusioned. Check out this article written for the Wall Street Journal by staff writer, Phil Kuntz to read the story behind Wipe Out and the Surfaris at: http://www.polarity1.com/pcrr2.html. The article is also in a book titled, Floating Off the Page: The Best Stories From the Wall Street Journal's ""Middle Column"" by Ken Wells, also available on Amazon."
positive,"A masterpiece: My favorite Garcia-Marquez title, and one of my favorite booksever. What a treat this book was to read. I remembergetting to the ending, and about 10 pages from the finishstarting to cry uncontrollably, and not stopping until longafter the book was done. A true work of beauty."
negative,"Pretty, but useless.: While this keyboard will add pizazz to your desk or your child's room, it is light and cheaply made. Moreover, the keys are either unresponsive or too sensitive. If you want a nice looking keyboard, buy it. If you actually need to type, skip this and look elsewhere."
negative,DO NOT BUY THIS! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!: These goggles are a waste of money. They break real easy and water gets in to your eyes. DO NOT BUY THESE! I REPEAT! DO NOT BY THESE! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY! DO YOU HEAR ME!
negative,Disappointing that Amazon's Price is 15.00 more than at B&N: Book has some interesting insight but does little to develop technical understanding. Is cheaper at B&N locally
negative,this book was awful: This book makes absolutely no sense at all. I read the first page and I didn't like it. I have to read it for school and I have fallen asleep 4 times reading it. All of my friends hate it to. We have a test on the 2nd day of 8th grade. Even using the Cliffs Notes didn't help at all. I don't recommend this book to anyone.
negative,"Strap broke within a few uses!: 1st, the cups were a bit small, & I know I gave the right size. Then, the strap broke! It's pretty, & they had my size, which is a small miracle in itself, but I wouldn't buy this again!"
negative,"Some interesting statistics but not much more: At the beginning of the book I had hopes but after several chapters of not making it anywhere fast I began skimming. There was really no useful information on investing for retirement.For those just getting started, I would recommend Dave Ramsey's ""Financial Peace Revisited."" It covers most of the topics covered in ""The Number"" but also gives you details in getting out of debt, mutual funds, buying smart etc etc. Other good books on money: ""Rich Dad, Poor dad"", ""Total Money Makeover"", ""Richest Man in Babylon""... those are the first that come to mind."
negative,Save your money: Poor quality. Broken parts. Misaligned holes. No way in the world my 6 year old could do any part of the assembly other than to hold the flashlight while I searched for holes on blind spots. He did enjoy the colorful words coming out of dad's mouth.
positive,"Fantastic!: The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the book is really fat, so when trying to read near the crack you have to sort of pry the book open, and it feels the binding might break. I doubt it though. Great deal! Entire book, handy side-notes... Get it!"
positive,"Works great: Needed this for my home stereo. Works great, was very cheap, and produces good quality sound, even at high volume."
positive,"Sweet and simple.: This is my go-to when I'm stressed from giving care, but short on time. It is a short, short book, but just what I need when I'm alone and need a little encouragement."
positive,Hours of fun: 12 yr old son bought these - great purchase for him. He has used them for hours on end - practicing and getting better and better at slight of hand. His only critique would be for them to be smaller. For his size hands - he has trouble hiding them.
negative,Does not work for tinea versicolor: I used this religiously until I finished the bottle. It did not help with my versicolor at all. All it really did is dry out my skin a lot.
negative,"Two Hours of Screaming!: This movie is terrible. I'm not surprised it made its way so fast to DVD - 2 hours of screaming - I don't call it singing. None of the songs had a melody, does not compare to Diana Ross and the Supremes, if this is what this story was supposed to be about. I turned it off 1 1/4 hour into the DVD - couldn't care less what happened to the characters. It seems people either hated or loved this one - I couldn't stand it. So far the worse movie I watched in 2007."
positive,"Best Controller Made Out Of All Companies: Sony Did it again!! With the vibration feature built right in it!! You May think it is a lot of money but it is worth it!! Don't by the third party products (madcats, nuby, interact, etc.) they sometimes will mess up your console. It has happened to me."
positive,"Strength and Honor: This is a remake of the embarassing 1992 Gladiator, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. Ridley Scott deserves his own series of games to honor him for making us forget that previous dreadful embarassment.Russel Crowe (in the Gooding Jr role) is terrific as General Maximus. His fine acting chops are supplemented well by his James T. Kirk-like build. Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, and Ollie Reed are more than entertaining, and the special effects are nicely done.The supplemental material on the DVD (with a nice behind the scenes documentary, and cutting room footage) is worth the price. The best thing about the DVD? You can fast forward past all those painful to watch Joaquin Phoenix scenes. Whew!"
negative,"Not for DCR-DVD 505: Main problem: it is WAY too small. It has room for the camera, and pretty much nothing else. None of the stock accessories like charging cords and such fit in it, much less any add-ons you may have bought or blank DVDs. This means you'll need a second case for all your accessories. I suppose it would be ok for a day bag if all you wanted to carry was the camera, but it just doesn't cut it as a main storage bag.Second problem: the battery is a joke. It is about half the thickness of the stock battery that comes with the DCR-DVD 505 (which itself, is two steps down from the highest capacity battery Sony offers as of 5/06). I don't even want to speculate on how quickly it would run out.In short, this kit is useless for the current generation of cameras. Buy a separate bag (I'm about to order the Sony LCSVA5) and if you need a spare battery, get a quality one."
negative,"Completely unsatifactory ending!: I have read the other reviews and think that most of the other reviewers are aging hippies that saw this movie in the '70s when it came out. The music was great and imaginative. The stake out scenes were too long.There was probably 30 minutes during stake outs that had maybe 4-5 pages of dialoge. Anyway the ending was typical of the time like ""Billy Jack"" or Easy Rider"". Show the cops in a bad light and let the rotten drug dealer get away. I'm sure it appealed to teenagers back then, but not today where we have 30+ years of hindsight on the drug scene. The mark of a great film is how soon would like to see it again. The answer in this case is never. I would rather get a root canal!"
positive,for spongebob fanatics...: I like the movie... Spongebob is charlie brown's counterpart who just happens to live in a pineapple under the sea....
negative,"Love the Simpsons, but this ain't Christmas.: Don't get me wrong. These are great episodes to be sure, but why did they put them in a compilation of Christmas episodes. Two of them have virtually nothing to do with Christmas at all. Just because you set a scene in the winter time does not make it a Christmas episode! The other two mention Christmas only as the jumping off point of their story, but never return to Christmas at all as a topic. No tree, no presents, no Christmas like fiascos. Once again, wonderful episodes, but they don't belong here."
positive,no such thing as a good anime ending!!!: Great disc the makes up for how slow paced season two part 1 went but it felt at times this disc was a lil too fast paced esp. on how some of the fist were getting beat up but still very entertaining wanted to see a lil more form to the fighters kind of how season one wanted to portray the martial arts mostly all out brawler at times not bad i guess still very entertaining worth 30 dollars yea probably you kinda get ur money's worth in entertainment i guess it to manga reading if you wanna get deeper into the story would've prob gave the masters a lil more background story but the 50 episodes what can you do :) :)
negative,"So disappointed: When The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe came out I didn't want to see it. I practically learned to read on the books, and they have remained favorite annual re-reads. As it turned out, I had no choice but to see it, through my work, and I was amazingly and pleasantly surprised.So I decided to see Prince Caspian too. Again I was surprised, but this time I was surprised by my disappointment. Did not follow the storyline at all. A lot of noise and violence, that was my main impression."
negative,"Gutless garbage: ""Under The Tuscan Sun"": Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal cliches about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You've never seen the white marble of Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, and therefore quite worth a look."
positive,"Lovely Celtic Instrumental Recording: The CDBABY site describes this as ""A fun, happy blast of traditional and original Irish and Scottish tunes from the bodhran player and percussionist from Solas, Riverdance and Bonnie Rideout Scottish Trio."" Holloway assembled an all-star cast of musicians for this and I certainly found it very enjoyable.Some titles (Camels in Kansas) clue the listener in that not all are traditional tunes. They are all celtic in feeling with the flute, bodhran and other traditional instruments lilting along to delight celtic music lovers."
negative,"I Can't Believe People Actually think This is Funny! STUPID: I really can't believe people think this is funny. I think that 'nerdy' 'geeky' types like this movie. My girlfriend and I just thought this was the geekiest, boring movie. REVENGE OF THE NERDS PART 5 or something similarily just not funny. I really am just amazed this film sells so well on the Internet... probably an Internet geek thing :-)"
negative,"SOMEWHAT MISLEADING TITLE....: Weisenthal didn't track down anyone in the spy sense. He interviewed them and was a great man in this area of expertise. The author misleads you with the title.I liked Simon Wiesenthal's own memoirs, ""The Murderers Among Us"", a whole lot more.The best TRACKER story is the great PETER MALKIN! Read Malkins books: 1.) Eichmann in My Hands, 2.) Ultimatum PU 94 (aka Peter Mann) and the extremely rare collectible 3.) Carlos Must Die.MALKIN and WIESENTHAL both died in 2005."
negative,"um... no.: I hated this book. People seem to give Paolini credit because he was a kid when he wrote it. But, he goes up and actually COMPARES his book to the greatness of other fantasy books like Beowulf and LOTR. If he wants to compare his book to books written by competent authors, his readers should grade Eragon with the same strictness. If Tolkien had written this, what would the reviews be? Much lower. The lack of originality and the obviously copied plot really take away from the actual book.I think my eyes were lacerated and bleeding after reading this trash."
positive,"Solidly made, easy to use, but a bit pricey: What can I say regarding these little clips? they work as intended and allow you to mount a cable in a situation, where plain grips with nails does not work (i.e. when you need to attach cable to a reinforced concrete wall, where nail simply won't go in). If it was a bit cheaper, i'd be a bit happier :)Anyways, this is a great product, I highly reccomend it."
negative,"BORING: The story was kind of interesting in the beginning, but went wayward in the middle and finally ended without a fizzle. It was bland and flat. I'm not sure it's worth being hard covered."
negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT: Bought this product for our office. Worked well for 13 months then stopped working. After having googled this and read many reviews I have realized that this product is very poorly designed. Our coffee maker started by short cupping. Then I attempted to descale it by pouring literally gallons of vinegar through it per the descale instructions. This did nothing to remedy the problem. In fact the computer started to malfunction and pour all of the vinegar/water out without heating it. Descaling did not work. Finally after weeks of trying to fix it I have given up. Of course it is one month past the warranty so I have no recourse. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Numerous other consumers have had the same problem. If you see a good review it is usually not related to reliability/durability. It usually starts with...""I've had this product for 2 days and it works great"" Fair warning."
negative,"Historical But Boring: I thought that the Witch of Blackbird pond was a fairly boring story. Throughout the book there's not anything very exciting that the characters say or do. I also thought that the ending was too happy. Every character in the book was very happy at the end and i thought that it was too much. I think that if i were to give this book a grade it would be a C-. And also, if you're going to read this book, I don't recommend that you should read it if you are under the age of 10. If you like history, romance, and happy endings, then I very strongly recommend this book for you. Otherwise you will most likely find this book very boring."
negative,"this takes too long: this takes too long, you have to apply it all day and that is annoying, get the freeze spray from dr scholes"
positive,"A Grand Slam: This book works on every level: writing style, grand and well defined themes, enormously entertaining, fantastic pacing, charecter developement. Just read the darn thing if you have not."
positive,The Court Jester: The Court JesterDanny Kaye's role as the court jester was great. The movie is so clean that my own children and even grandchildren will enjoy it. What a great way to pass on the classics. I was very happy with the description on line. I had no questions about the movie being the same as I had seen and enjoyed as a child.
positive,"Fantastic!: It's a great album! Rap, hip-hop, soulful R&B all wrapped into one. She definitely has a soulful and powerful voice. A MUST to buy album!"
negative,"THIS FAKE AND MEDIOCRE PRODUCTION: After watching some great Chinese productions (The Banquet, The Golden Flower etc.), I bought this based upon the five star rating here. It is garbage, period."
negative,"Too Small for a Shower Curtain: This rod is way to small for use with a shower curtain. I have no idea why it even comes up in the search. It may work for a simple curtain, but I doubt it."
positive,"BabyLounge.com gives A Special Delivery 4 pacifiers (of 5): This unique book is a chronicle of letters between a mother and daughter living worlds apart, but manage to stay connected with letters full of love, hope, and the anticipation that comes with pregnancy.Mothers and daughters across the world will relate to this book and give them a new appreciation for the incredible bond that is shared between them. The bond that is magically multiplied exponentially when a grandchild is on the way.This wonderfully touching book will make you realize that no matter how far apart you are from loved ones, you can always be close at heart."
negative,"Cheese-o-Rama.: Well, I love independent film and I love little guy directors but Me & Michael has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. When contemplating the reason why it is so awful one can only conclude that this fellow has very, very little talent. This account of his career as a videographer in LA reeks of perpetual illegitimacy. A lot of what is supposed to be live footage is obviously staged and his impersonation of foreigners is totally cheesy. As a matter of fact, everything about the movie is totally cheesy. You almost feel sorry for the guy, but can't because the venture is so misguided that it's hard not to wonder how he missed all the glaring indicators that he will never be a success in the glitterati business. Oh well, at least it is short. Yet this hour drags by painfully. I can't believe anyone, and I mean anyone, could give it a decent rating."
positive,"Good old school firefighting: Good stuff. This book details the evolution of FDNY's Rescue Company, focusing on R2.Interesting because:#1 - Did not realize the Rescues were that busy#2 - Did not realize that Rescue Co.'s ""picked"" their guysJust a great overall inside look at this Rescue and the men that rode it......full of stories about tough and odd jobs from the 1960's to today."
negative,"Lots of small pieces: To be exact, this is what you get:1 chimney2 vertical sign holders2 rood ridges2 tripple/flat6 roof slats (3 green+3 yellow)8 tripple round2 double & half20 doubles70 singles (barrels)I hope you like building with singles because there areNot very many big pieces.The set is wooden. The review saying that they are plastic is wrong."
positive,"Will take a 15.5"" laptop: I have an XPS GEN 2 Inspiron which is 15.5"" long. I had an older version of this backpack that the XPS would just fit into snugly but, alas, the zipper teeth eventually broke off. I was concerned that this backpack might be too small and after first slipping the laptop in... it didn't. But I discovered that theres a removable cushion liner at the bottom of the laptop slot (attached with Velcro), removing that gave me an extra half an inch and voila, the laptop fits (albeit snugly again). The laptop isn't completely unprotected at the bottom, there's a hard plastic shell there as well and the snug fit keeps the laptop from sliding around. 15.5"" is max though...those with a larger laptop (say the newer 16"" wide Dell XPS latops) will probably want to seek another backpack."
negative,Poor and cheap quality book.: The quality is quite poor. Dover thrift Editions. i will not purchase anything they publish again.
negative,"boring, been done, boring, been done: This book is boring. The storyline is a hodgepodge of what other authors have already done. And as some other reviwers have pointed out, the female characters are tiresome,pathetic really. Doesn't liveup to the hype. At all. Great cover, though,but if you judge by the cover you're in for bit of BIG dispointment."
negative,"The deadline...: Who is Queens Of The Stone age?1 Person?I think this album is the deadline of J. Homme,I hope it...Horrible."
positive,"awesome release by LUSTMORD: This CD is awesome, it is pure sound manipulation in case metavoid scared you off, he is back to his original sounds. This CD is awesome stuff, i also highly recommend zoetrope the DVD movie, it is a short film and it is intense, really intense, and lustmords music makes it even more so. you have to buy the CD separtae though b/c it is expanded to an hour of music, it also contian a trailer of the movie. I also want to recommned carbon/core by lustmord, this is another expansion of music that he made for the happy pencil website and it is intense, some really dark stuff."
positive,"Don't let the price fool you!: I have used all kinds of calipers over the years, some good, some bad, some cheap, some very expensive. As long as you are not doing spec work and making your own bearings and cages, these are a fantastic value and have many varied uses."
positive,"Almost Heaven...: Although released as a Boys Air Choir recording, this is rather misleading as Connor Burrows actually sings solo on this excellent choral offering.Connor, a former chorister from St.Paul's Cathedral as were his younger singing siblings Edward and Patrick, was I feel in many way sadly overlooked as a suberb treble, by the deserving success of his fellow chorister at the time Anthony way.Connor Burrows sharper, and perhaps slightly more powerful tones in evidence on this solo album, are well suited to the tracks chosen for this recording.He sings Faure's Sanctus beautifully, to match any other version of it I've so far heard, and the scales he reaches in Lacrimosa have to be heard to be believed!He's less well suited to singing the more gentle carols, Away In a Manger and In The Bleak Mid Winter, but overall a pleasing CD with a treble voice at its peak."
positive,"At last! A reference that is worth reading (cover to cover)!: When it comes to references and ""secrets of"" books, there are so many choices that it makes finding a decent book nearly impossible. I am delighted to have stumbled onto ""Visual Basic Annotated Archives."" Whether you need to learn how to write an ActiveX DLL or simply wish to look at snippets of clever code, this is the one to consider. I heard that one of the authors (Kent) is a teacher... it shows in his writing style, which is very easy to follow."
positive,"Allow your mind to voyage on the ocean of the sky.: Listen, as great three masted sailing ships take to the sky, cargo holds packed with winged sheeps and the fabulous flying Frombork. Sky pirates appear of the port bow, and only Captain Jack with his Lightning Sword and magical Top Hat can save the day.The Incredible Adventures of Jack Flanders is an enchanting audio fantasy. It is packed with High Adventure and Magic, and a fair amount of wisdom. The story begins when Jack recieves a Large Overstuffed Green Velvet chair in the mail. At midnight, when he slumbers in the chair, his mind travels to the fantastic realms of the Nevermind. His travels take him aboard the Sky Galleon ""Blue Swallow,"" where he clashes swords with the pirate queen ""The Black Mona Lisa."" He encounters Little Freida, with the piggy tales and havana cigars. He travels to the Velvet Realms and bargins with the Lords of Death.A very satisfying adventure."
positive,Great item!: I ordered this for my mom who has a very small bathroom and was looking for somewhere to put her extra towels. This nicely holds 4 bath towels. Not big enough to hold bath sheets. But it works perfectly for what she needed it for. It looks really nice too.
positive,"UNFORGETABLE - HUMOROUS, HEROIC, ROMANTIC, THRILLING: This book is so good. Fast dialogue, adventurous, romantic and full of heroic characters. You laugh, you hold your breath you cheer. I have read this book no less than 5 times. I have now added it to my Kindle. Ransom is a story of passion and mystery, you just can't put it down.The SecretThe Bride"
positive,"Daunting but Delightful: My quirky yet brilliant English teacher assigned this work in the beginning of my senior year. Undoubtedly, I approached this book with much doubt and skepticism. If you know Hardy, you immediately recall his superfluity of detail and monotonous landscaping, which inevitably impedes character and plot development. Suprisingly, though all discouraging factors were present, I found the book exceptionally appealing. Hardy's portraiture of Tess validates him as a captivating author. He draws us into her persona, leaving us trampled and bruised with the grievances of life. He walks us through her struggles, though mangled with her inability to step forward, she still persists.I highly reccommend this book to any avid reader of British literature."
positive,"I liked this book.: This was a good book. I just finished reading it for a tenth grade English class and it was good. It was kinda boring at first, but I liked it. I would recommend it to my friends."
negative,"Mediocre: This is a mediocre book at best. The tests give you an illusion that you are a genius too. It is full of self fullfiling falacies. If you think you are a genius, you are... maybe not. Just review your scores on the SAT, GMAT, GRE, or whatever test you have taken. If you did not score in the top percentile, don't call yourself a genius because the tests within these books said so. That is if you don't want to embarass yourself in public, or even in private company.There are far better books out there on how to train and develop your multiple intelligences. This is not the one.Check authors like Michael Gelb, Tony Buzan, Thomas Armstrong, Howard Gardner, and David Coleman. They have developed a ton of serious well researched materials and methods on this subject. They all provide far better stuff than this book."
positive,Beautifully written and insightful perspective.: I have read and re-read this book several times. It is a lovely story and written very well. It let's us know that everyone is human and in all communities there are good things and not so good things. Take the good and leave the rest. I have drawn on some of Sue Bender's experiences with the Amish and applied them in my own life. How wonderful to be able to read about someone else's experience and feel like you are there by their side.
positive,"definitely runs big, straps must be sewn on: I ordered the dress for my graduation ceremony. After reading the reviews, I ordered a size smaller than usual, and the dress is still too large- particularly in the bust. I am a C cup, but I would need DDDD's to fill the top, lol. Definitely order at least one size smaller than the size chart states.I was expecting the optional straps to be easily attached with hooks, as has been the case with all of my other strapless dresses. However, they come with nothing to attach them, and you need to sew them on if you want to use them. I wish the bowing (to maintain the shape) ran down the entire dress and not just the top. The dress also seems thinner than other satin dresses I have owned, but you get what you pay for.In all, after a little alteration, I think it will be fine for the occassion. I ordered the black, and aside from the fitting, the dress is beautiful."
negative,"Did not work for me: I have a well, and this sprinkler did not work with it. The head did not rotate properly. Maybe not enough psi?"
negative,"Smart alec cracks wise: A writer tells the story of how he and his wife break up. There is very little action here. What there is in every line is glib cracks, lame humor and sarcasm. Ruark even asks one of his characters: ""Why can't people just talk without all the smart remarks and sarcasm?"" Good question."
negative,"GEORGE MICHAEL'S GUEST APPEARANCE...: ... is really a terrific lead vocal performance on ""Jive Talkin'""... the rest of this recording is pure jive turkey."
negative,"To messy to ever want to do the projects: We have only done a couple of projects, it is extremely messy and will stain. My highschooler had no real interest in it, as my middle schooler finds it interesting but often forgets it even exsists in the house. Everyone in our house lost interest in it pretty quickly. Best for a parent that loves doing these type of activities WITH their kid and doesn't worry to much about messes or stains in their home. Not overly educational, it just tells you to mix this with that, so you are just throwing ingredients together but not really sure what or why it is making formations... not overly amazing formations either... although maybe if we did more, there might be better formations to complete."
positive,"WONDERFUL BOOK: If you didn't want to take the time to read the review by Stan Moore, take my word for it...This book is a truly wonderful look at the plight of the peregrine as a species. Jim Enderson is without a doubt one of the top peregrine biologists in the world, and has created a memoir that is an absolute gem. Buy this book!"
positive,"Tom Savini astounds with Romero's updated script.: I was so skeptical about this that it was out for years before I ever saw it. Why bother remaking a classic? Well, because frankly it fixes the things that bugged me in the original. Barbra has been transformed from a comatose gimp to a heroine who rises from her initial shock to find more strength than she ever knew she had. The acting is great! I watched the original again last night, and I must say that the acting alone is worth remaking it. The conflict between Ben and Cooper makes a bit more sense this time around. Ben's fate, which was needed in the original, gets a satisfying twist, but Cooper's fate is even better. WOW! Classic lines like ""Here's another one for the fire"" get a stunning spin. The lighting is too bright and I must admit some of the creepiness of the original depended on shadows in black and white, but that doesn't keep me from loving this fantastic remake. (I swear, they must have found the same farmhouse.)"
negative,"There are better CCNA books out there.: I have to start by saying that just because you are a CCIE certainly doesn't make you a good writer. And that is what you will find here in the Cisco Press CCNA books by Odom. I find the writing rudimentary at best and Odoms command of real world analogies could use some work.The questions for each chapter are not only poorly written to begin with, but there lacks any explanation in the answers section as to why a particular answer is right and why one is wrong. This is key to learning the material, you need to know why you got something wrong, not just that it *is* wrong. I might recommend this book if you are re-certifying and already know the material, but if you are a first timer, beware. You will find Odoms style of writing to be somewhat confusing and at times completely unhelpful."
positive,"It was okay: The shipping took a bit and the book was wrinkled in the middle :L.But, the book was in pretty good shape and I liked the book, too :)."
negative,"How *BAD* can a film get!: Thie is definitely one of the worst pieces of cinematic trash that it has ever been my misfor- tune to see,"
negative,"Very disappointing: Although the story is well known to me, the editing of this audio book was so confusing. I absolutely could not follow it. Too much is cut out."
positive,"Pretty good: This swaddle blanket is pretty good but not awesome. It's gotten easy for my baby to get out of, or get tangled in, now that she is 3 months and can use her arms. I am not sure what to do now since she wiggles out and wakes up. But until now it was a great deal for its price."
positive,"Pounding but thought provoking: The first time I heard this CD at a friend's house, I hated it. But after another listen or two, I ended up loving it. The lyrics are insightful and political, and are paired with driving, heavy riffs. The best songs are definitely Aerials, Chop Suey!, Toxicity, Prison Song, Forest, Needles and Science. However, all of them are good and they are the type of songs that will get you pumped really easily. If you like hard rock, chances are you will like this album.( I have also heard Steal This Album, which has some of the unreleased material from the Toxicity recording session. It is very good too.)"
negative,"In the immortal works of Monty Python: RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY.When and if it works, it looks great.I wish I could rate this at NO stars because of the paper jam or out of paper issue. I guess it's come to the point where we have to beg, plead and pray just to get something to work as advertised. I purchased this a Wal-Mart for $50, so I would bet that American manufacturers are thinking that ""if they only spend 50 bucks, what did they expect?"" ""They should have paid more so it will work."""
positive,if you love Goodfella or DrugKing type movies.....: then this should be a good watch for you.Depp is soooooo hot and he plays the drug king perfectly. Cruz is absolutely sexy as his crazy wife.Its awesome if you like movies based real life on drug kings or mafia/mobsters.
negative,"It works... for a while: Although the software interface wasn't the most sophisticated, the WG111 was easy to install and worked well enough for about six months. Then it started dropping connections to the various networks I'd been using, and now it doesn't connect at all. I've done quite a bit of troubleshooting; apparently, it's fairly common for the WG111 to crap out after several months. Don't buy it."
negative,"The Sari Bones is Good but it Takes the Paint off your car: If you own a car that you don't care about the paint, then this bike mount is perfect for you. However, if you have a car that you would like to preserve your paint job, then invest in a trailer hitch mount. I personally like my mount but I'm giving it a 1 because it is really tough on the car's paint job. Especially where the 6 rubber tipped connectors attach to different parts of the body of the car. There is a lot of strain on the paint due to the weight of the bikes. The rubber feet on the top and bottom of the center of the device is great but it too will eventually harm your paint. Giving it a 1 because of this."
positive,the best ever: the best hair product I've used until now already very good even though I commend to two friends who also loved. the best ever
negative,"Leaked striaght frpm the box: I chose this twin air mattres becaue of the reviews and brand, good quality. I bought it about 2 months ago for a weekend of Holiness, it just had a hole when i aired it up. Threw it in the trash terrible product."
negative,"Not very enrichment friendly: After ordering 17,897 units of this product I was very disappointed to find I still didn't have enough Uranium for my project.Several of my lead researchers advised me that I would need at least need another 500,000 units to go ahead with my 'final solution.'I was so angry at this news I had four of them beheaded. Now I am left with one clumsy scientist and 17,897 units of low grade Uranium which are of absolutely no use to anyone.Not only that, the Uranium you see sold above is of low grade and I would not recommend it to anyone looking to blow up a small to medium sized country off the Mediterranean sea.If you want my advice, contact the Russians.Since doing so I have never looked back. Allahu Akbar!"
positive,"Great WW II Movie: This is a great presentation of the US entry intry into WW II. The special effects aare exceptional. I have a collection of WW II films and many of the action scenes are taken from this movie. The origianl footag is put into the finished product with expertise and taste. I think every high school student shoudl see this to help us from forgetting the trauma of Dcember 7, 1941."
positive,"Good Stuff...: Nice package for your kids. Although it can be complicated, it's worth the money. Though you may have to sit at the computer and work with your youngster to help him/her understand the full potential of the product."
negative,"it was okay: I had to read this book for school, and at first I hated it. The beginning chapter is hard to understand because of all the symbolism, however, it eventually gets better. (slowly) It is easy to miss some concepts if you don't read slowly enough. I felt that the ending was far-fetched and boring. I did enjoy reading about a dystopian society, but altogether, the book is tedious and slow-moving."
negative,disappointed: i ordered orwells 1984 on may 27. my card was charged. i did not recieve book. where do i go for a refund? steve
negative,"Too Pricey!: We purchased these for awhile because they were the only diapers that would stand up to the ""blowouts"" but let me tell you the Target brand diapers are the same quality for SOOOO much less $ If I had any advice for people getting Pampers or Huggies it would be try Target brand they are the best I promise you won't be disappointed. Don't try Kroger or Kmart brands or anything similar just Target. Only if someone told us this a year ago we'd have a Ferrari by now with all the money we saved after switching!"
negative,"Major let down: ...The book is more about Auel's hypothesis of what the region looked like, and how people lived, than it is and actual story. No build up. No climax. This title is a best seller because we all expected it to live up to the last four books. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close. This is the last of the series I spend good money on."
positive,Two Thumbs Up: I went to the theater to see this movie & I thought it was great. I really liked the special effects. Now the chemistry between the actors/actresses could've been better. I reaally liked the set too. I just thought everything about the movie was great. I can't believe that people whom have seen it are giving it bad reviews.
positive,"Great latin disco: I have only gotten interested in disco in the last few years, but now I am a huge fan. some of my faves include: Salsoul 12"", P&P Records Best of, Disco Connection Series, best of WestEnd, & 12"" Grand Series. However, even compared to these releases, this CD is the bomb. The first few tracks really jump out at you as infectious dance floor groovers. Although the tracks on this CD are clearly Latin in influence & style, on a musical spectrum I would put the music on this disc somewhat closer to the Salsoul sound than I would to Fania All-Stars disco-era salsa music."
positive,Dune it is wordy but great: this book is an exelant book it has twist and turns that are unexpected. The auther is cunning and layers and layers of diffrent plots aginst each other. The worst thing about the book it is a slow read becuase you are getting some much differnt twist and turns in just one page.
positive,"Not for the casual: This is a fun game to play, but it's freakin' hard. I've never been able to progress past the first level because I can't really make the adjustment from GoldenEye-style play to MGS-style play that you need to get along.Multiplayer is, however, a joy. The levels are small enough that it's pretty much constant mayhem for two players."
negative,a trial to read: I can not describe how much I did not enjoy this book. It took me 5 months to read it for a reason and I consider 5 days a long time to read a book. So much description and no plot made this book feel like it was 1000 pages long. It just never got anywhere. I cared nothing about any of the characters and finished it only so I could say I did.
positive,"Recycle but Worth the Read for Die Hard Fans: Is it a rehash? Yes. Is it good? Yes. To create write this book use the following formula:1 part Stand1 part It2 parts Tommyknockers1 part The Body (Stand by Me)Dash of the Dark TowerCombine ingredients. Mix well. Read for a week or until done.The book is good; however, it seems more like of a ""Best Of"" and does not really stand on its own. With some much interspec, there is no worry that this one will be a movie/mini-series."
positive,"Ten gold bananas for Gorilla: Ten gold bananas, two thumbs up and hurrah for Gorilla! What a wonderful book. It was a pleasure to read! If you just want to get comfortable and enjoy a book-this is the one I would suggest."
positive,"my mom loved it: i bought this dvd for my mom... she's a huge paquita fan... she still watches it whenever she can... if ur a fan, u'll luv it too."
negative,"junk: this thing is nothing but s piece of junk it came broke,didnt,work i wouldnt of rated it but i had to:[DO NOT BUY THIS ITEAM-it is nothing but a piece of junk"
positive,"Right on. Not perfect, but a worthy performance.: This is a great live album. I think Rolling Stone magazine was certainly too picky, and many others are over critical. You can't compare this album to older releases like ""Ya-Ya's"" or ""Love You Live"" because a lot of the material on this album was contemporary of the time, and sounds great. Highlights are definitely ""Satisfaction"" (possibly the BEST version!), ""Under My Thumb"", and ""Start Me Up."" The only problem is that the film companion to this album, ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" (unfortunately no longer available), has far greater versions of ""Let Me Go"" (10x better), and ""20 Flight Rock"" than this album's, and the film also has live gems like ""Hangfire"", ""Neighbors"", and ""Let it Bleed"", which should have been included on this album. If you can, try and get the video, because when combined with ""Still Life"" you've got a great live Stones set."
positive,"First part of the rings: The Hobbit, the first part of the Rings Trilogy, was a fun and entertaining escape novel. But I was surprised that it didn't give us much of the story behind the ring or its evil power. In fact, it seemed in this story to be relatively harmless and actually quite helpful for Mr. Baggins. There was none of the ominous dread of the dark forces finding its bearer. Even Gollum did not play much of a part except at the beginning when Bilbo first finds the ring and finds out its secret power of invisibility."
positive,"Superb: When I first heard the singles Aerials and Toxicity I knew I had to check this album out. I read some of the reviews on amazon and were more or less accurate to how I feel about this album. The vibrant 'Prison song' starts the show and sets you up for some serious rocking and it just flows from one song to another so easily. Technically they are brilliant Serj Tankian's voice is so unique and hauntingly changes from madness to mellow in seconds. There are, in my opinion 10 great songs on this album but one to look out for (after the favourites Chop suey,deer dance,Toxicity and Aerials) is 'Forest' the drumming and guitars are mind blowing. Buy this album!"
negative,waste of money for lg dogs: did not work for my dogs. waste of money. easy to return.still looking for one that is simple and works. i have mastiffs and found it flimsey.maybe it works for small dogs
negative,"not as good as all that: this album - overated? yes. Overhyped? yes. overplayed? yes.are there any redeeming features? yes. the end.short, but to the point, this album is overated tripe, worthy of nothing but burning."
negative,Burnout 5 Is Not Paradise: I wish I would have known the following before I wasted $60 on this.Road Rage is still my favorite except Open World = No Instant Restart = Lame. Constantly checking the map sucks. Crash Mode is gone. And there's no split-screen. With the Burnout series the only thing I want to do is Crash Mode and Road Rage with my wife. Thank you EA for making my wife cry!Now go make Burnout 6 fun again...
positive,"Great!: Now, the warrior series had become one of my favorite books. This is a book that you've got to read!"
negative,Couldn't wait to see it... couldn't WAIT 'til it was over!: Bought bags of Raisenettes and M&M Peanuts to enjoy this movie with... 30 minutes into it and I couldn't wait for it to end. I hate this movie! One of my top 5 all-time bad films. Painful to sit thru!
negative,"Needs a rewrite: This could have been a better book if the author spent more time on character development. For example, Tanya's boyfriend was not a well developed character. He was just thrown in for a happy ending. Curtis was far more interesting. I wanted to know what made him tick."
positive,"An enjoyable piece of literature: I picked up Of Mice and Men because it was short and I figured that I could read a good book in a small amount of time. The book turned out to be as expected if not better. I think that it is possible to get as much if not more sometimes out of a short book like this one. The book kept me involved in the plot all the way till the end. The ending made the book very good, but you will have to read it for yourself to get that satisfaction!"
positive,"Great book filled with Adventure!: The Hobbit puts you in another world with unique characters. The Hobbit Bilbo Baggins is dragged somewhat reluctantly out of his nice comfortable Hobbit hole to help some Dwarves reclaim their stolen treasure. Many times when they are facing enemies such as spiders and trolls, Bilbo longs to be sitting in his easy chair by the fire. Everyone can relate to that!"
positive,"A Highlight of the Series -- So Far...: This is the ninth book in the Aubrey/Maturin series and it stands as one of the best, in my opinion, and nearly a rival for ""Desolation Island."" With all due respect to most of the other reviews here, this book had me riveted and quite moved by the end. Maybe it has something to do with the main setting: Malta, Eqypt and the Red Sea. Some people may be bored by it. I felt the story played across the desert landscape quite beautifully. This is a gripping read, full of political and personal intrigue, great atmosphere, science (Stephen and that damned diving bell) and pitch-perfect characterizations, especially of the two principal protagonists. While Maturin is usually treated more three-dimensionally in the books, it is rare to see Aubrey as fully. Here you have him whole, and powerfully heroic."
positive,"A delicious side dish or you can jazz it up into a main course item!: This is a great side dish so you can add in some fried hamburger, sausage or smoked sausage and make more of a main course item out of it. It is delicious and tasty and easy to fix. If you toss in 1 pound of meat it makes six servings of one cup each. You can also throw in some vegetables into the mix and we use frozen corn or small pieces of broccoli. We love the spicy and cheesy taste.I have listed below the Nutrition Data but I would like to point out that you should be aware of the sodium content as one cup contains 28 percent of your daily allowance of sodium and that does not include any meat that you might add.Amount Per Serving % Daily ValueCalories: 150Calories from Fat: 20Total Fat: 2.5g 4%Saturated Fat: 1g 5%Cholesterol: .5mg 1%Sodium: 660mg 28%Total Carb: 27g 9%Dietary Fiber: <1g 4%Sugar: 4gProtein: 4gVitamin A: 4%Vitamin C: 15%Calcium: 8%Iron: 8%"
negative,"Annie's Witch Of Blackbird Pond Review: This book was one I read in sixth grade and it was dull and slow. Not great and I usually love books about witches for I am very interested in the topic and it is not unusual for I live in Massachusettts and as you know in Salem, Massachusetts was where they hanged witches. But the one flaw in this book was that it was dull and barely talked about Kit meeting up with the witch of blackbird pond and just told about her life basically from the barbadoes and her coming to Conneticut. Second of all the biggest flaw in this book is that the witch hunt took place in Conneticut! Uh! Uh! I don't think so. Conneticut is definetly not a setting for a witch hunt. That is definetly Massachusetts. You may have heard of witch hunts in Conneticut but a few and Massachusetts is of course the homeland for witch hunts in New England. Sorry Elizabeth George Speare but get your history right!"
negative,Lacking in Instructional Tips: I was expecting to get some pointers for developing skills in c/country skiing. There was no verbal instruction ...only an hour long video showing a man skiing. I shared this video with another cross-country skier who also felt this video had no merit for someone wanting to learn skills. I want a video that gives instructional tips.
negative,This was a bad idea: I ate the whole thing and it tasted funny and now I feel funny and sometimes I lose control of my finghersda';jaf[sdij but mostly I'm okay I guess. What I'm trying to say is that this candy is terrible.
negative,"All the time in the world: The author missed out on this one. While it is a good read, the author mis-uses a genetic disease for what afflicts the heroine. Just another book to confuse the general public about neurofibromatosis."
negative,"Oh Marty!: I loved Marty Robbin's singing, songwriting, showmanship and charisma but he appeared in a couple of movies that were amateurishly trashy. This is one of them."
negative,"Anyone want to buy a used Binaural CD?: Go ahead. Write me off as a casual, post-Ten Pearl Jam fan if it makes you feel better. Assume that I know nothing about the history of the band, or what their stance is in the music scene, or have heard none of their B sides. The fact of the matter is, this CD is pathetic. It has the sound of a weak garage recording, where Eddie's vocals are often drowned out by play that is about as tight as cheesecloth. The beauty and draw of this band has always been Eddie's vocals, which are virtually background noise here. If this is a sign of things to come for the band, then I guess I'll stick with the old stuff, and try and forget they ever made an album after Live on 2 legs. Maybe I'm just not ""in"" enough to ""understand"" what the band is doing, but I think its a lame excuse by people clinging desparately to what they want to hear. If it were any other band, it wouldn't have sold 200 copies."
positive,"Excellent portable stand, especially for touring: The Pyramid Bottom Bracket bike stand is a great option to take along on those overnight rides. For example, when I do the DALMAC ride it allows me to stand my bike up during the overnight stays instead of laying it down on the ground or trying to find a (scarce) tree at the campground. With my bike standing I can then hang my riding clothes on it to dry in the sun. For these reasons I highly recommend this portable bike stand."
positive,Melissa and Doug Playful Pets Jigsaw puzzle 12 pieces: Puzzle is big and colorful and interesting to look at. Purchased it for when my 2 year old grandson comes to visit. He loves it! I already purchased another puzzle with a different pic. he loved this so much. I recommend purchasing these puzzles they are fun for little hands and sturdy too.
negative,"OMG-BORING!!!!: The language is so Old World, I found it difficult 2 understand. I read about 35 pages & decided Y waste my time on something so ""Drawl"". It was written in the early 1800s & I just have a really hard time/the social ladder instilled during that era. I honestly don't understand Y it's getting such high * ratings."
negative,Errors Noted In The Content: There are incorrect items written about in a number of the topics discussed in this book. When you buy a book you want to know you paid for correct advice and information. Some items were helpful but I wonder how many other issues are wrong that I didn't check into further.
positive,"Valuable Source of Information: I found Ms. Smith's book to be an outstanding reference source. It is a ""must keep"" for anyone's personal reference library. The author provided the reader with a clear and easy understanding of the processes behind on-line networking. Her use of analogies made even complex technological issues easily understood by the non-technical person.Her suggestions for putting together a highly effective resume were outstanding. I am currently going through a career change, and found her resume formatting process to be superior. I am now in the process of completing my updated resume (using several of her techniques.) I am quite anxious to let it go on-line and see what develops. I have recommended her book to others."
positive,"Small towns rock!: I've read all the novels John Grisham has written. I have liked some better better than others, but THE LAST JUROR reeled me in from the beginning. The protaganist is believable, and it is neat to watch him find his voice as he interacts with the residents in a small town. Grisham is meddling in ""social history""--he hits class issues, civil rights, gun control, the buying habits of small town USA, and on and on.He has a disclaimer about certain Mississippi/Ford county laws with which he took liberty, but on page 114, he has the first Italians in Ford county loaded into 1904 Ford Model T's at the railroad station. Oops. The first Model T's were built in 1908.I'm glad that John, like Willie, has made lots of money doing what he likes to do. Now he has the resources to do a little experimenting. In my opinion, Grisham is never a dull read!"
positive,"A Book for All Ages: This is a great story for people of all ages. As a teenager, I felt at one with the antagonist of the story. As an adult I see her transition more clearly than before. It is also a reminder of the power of the emotions of adolescence and those first real learning experiences, something I hope I will never forget."
negative,"unoriginal: Hmm, this is going to be a short review because there really isn't much to say and everyone else has already said it. If you want a more childish adventurous fantasy book then this is great. Its got all the archetypical plotlines, characters, magics, and creatures you could ever want. It just has a story that is fun to read, nothing more and therefore it gets no more than two stars. I can't believe at how popular this is and that it already has a movie, kinda sad. To unoriginal. . ."
positive,"Love these diapers: These diapers have been my go to with both my children. They do not leak overnight, and do not cause any skin irritation like other diapers. If you are looking for a quality diaper, order Baby Dry diapers!"
negative,ZZZZZZZZ.......: I almost gave up in the midle of it. I didn't know where i found motivation to keep reading; probably because I didn't have another book in hands to try.Boring!
positive,"A story of today: This is a story everyone should read. Nothing has changed in our world since this book was written. The acting Mr. Scrooge of today are our bankers, politicians and sports stars who have care for no one but themselves."
positive,"I loved this book: I read several reviews on this book already, and feel that what I have to say about this book has already been said. I loved this book, and found it to be quite the page turner."
positive,Top 10 movie!: This is an excellent movie with Will Smith and the future. Robots are realistic and the future is not so far away. I've showed to all my science classes...and robotics classes.
positive,"MUST HAVE!!!!!: With a collection the size of Marty Eck's, there was no doubt in my mind this book would be awesome. The book has all color photos (over 700), and contains EVERYTHING (even shipping boxes for the gum card boxes and halloween costumes!). Values listed are accurate (although I disagreed slightly with the Monkees LPs). Great book for even the casual fan...Eck did an exceptional job!"
positive,"Need for Speed in a Burnout style: this game is great. the feeling that we miss in the newly released Need for Speed: ProStreet, is available in this game. all the features included are great, it has all the previous features plus new ones.online multiplayer is fun. you can actually get the achievments while playing online with your friends."
positive,Best Religious Movie Ever Seen: I was surprised to see that I couldn't get enough of this movie and played it over and over. Thanks to all those involved who made this movie come to life. The actor who played Padre Pio looked so much like him.
positive,"The Hobbit: Fun book, I enjoyed it more than the movie though the movie was still entertaining. Here is five more words"
negative,"Blu Ray transfer is awful: This Blu-ray transfer is just awful for such a great film. The colors are all washed out and the color contrasts are no different than what I would see on DVD. It actually looks a bit worse as you can see all sorts of color problems in the darker locker room scenes. If anything, the high definition blu ray actually accentuates how poor the transfer is! I would almost think that I'm watching an old VHS tape."
negative,"Jawbone Repair Kit? Maybe: In an odd case of poor quality control, the package of eargels came with two of one of the six sizes and missing one of the others. I bought them to make my Jawbone headset fit. It's better than it was, but still not ergonomic."
positive,"On the wild side...: Join Jeff Corwin as he shows us the dry, hot desert of Arizona, the life and death struggle in southeastern Africa, the rain forests of Costa Rica, and the grasslands of the Venezuela. Along the way we learn about life, death, love, and the web of nature. He also pops in facts and short stories, many of which are as funny as you can get without a Nun's outfit, a donkey and a jar of peanut butter.The book itself is a lovely hardcover, with full color photos and something I would be proud to have on my coffee table if I had a coffee table. And it is so enjoyable to read you could easily finish it in a day if you wanted to."
negative,"Just awful: This really is a dreadful book. It's all setting, no plot. To save you the time, here's what happens: Ayla and hubby arrive at his hometown; Ayla demonstrates all her inventions; Ayla has baby. Yes, sportsfans, that's 750 pages worth! The book is hideously repetitive. If Ayla had shown off her Thread-Puller one more time, or if she enjoyed Pleasures with Jondalar again, I think I would have tossed my cookies. I wish Auel had written instead an anthropological treatise on early human life in southern France; that's what she's really interested in anyway. Definitely pass on this one."
positive,Gift for Son: This is the same set we have had for twenty five years. Its reasonably priced and I hope it lasts as long as our set has.
negative,"Good idea...not so good product.: The idea of having your flip flop hold some ounces of liquid is a fun idea, however, after wearing the sandals for almost a month off and on, the container shattered and the area that is right under your arc became very uncomfortable. I would stick to the sandals with the bottle top opener."
negative,mummy: It was good the only thing I didnt like was the picture on our TV. I dont know to much about DVD movies but the picture was half on the screen. What gives? Movie seemed to fake
positive,FANTASTIC!!: More hip hop then his others. I think this is one of the best he has done! I would recommend it to any one!!!!!! God bless!
negative,"The music lives: I love the music of this old Christmas piece, full of memories. I've listened to it on records and CDs for years, but I wanted the visual effect of the opera, which I have seen onstage, live. This is a film of the original production;,uesbut sadly, the 1955 TV production values are a disappointment. I expected black-and-white, but the total effect is so much inferior to, say, a 1955 motion-picture film. That said, the voices are splendid!"
negative,"ratio/aspect: persona was release 1.37:1, and mgm are releasing it as 1.66:1. if they're redoing hour of the wolf and shame for those mistakes, why are'nt they redoing persona? anyone? where could i find an answer for this one? thanks."
positive,"Blood, Gore, thriller, mystery: This book has it all.The story gets a bit confusing at times,but enjoyable nonetheless. I gather from the characters in the story some were from a previous read. I wish the author had tied these characters a bit better because it was frustrating knowing a connection, but just not getting it."
positive,"Tiny!: I love my Tiny the Chihuahua! He is so cute and I recommend him to collectors, especally if you love chihuahuas like me."
negative,Well...: This is a great old TV series and certainly an asset to my vast collection. I expected digitally mastered though and quality is far less than I thought it would be. Picture is fuzzy and sound is awful.
positive,"Holy crap... it's neato.: This album is absolutely awesome. And neato. I like to listen to it lots. This has got to be my favorite Beatles album. Every song is perfect, specifically ""Blue Jay Way"" and ""I Am the Walrus"". These are awesome songs. Everyone should own this album, because it is really cool. So, duh."
positive,Coast salish essays: my son was convinced that this book would not ever be available so he was very pleased with it and I was pleased because I received it in a timely manner and it was in great condition.
positive,"How to Say NO to a Stubborn Habit: Excellent book! It is so biblical, practical, and helpful for anyone struggling with habits that they need to overcome. I bought several of these books to distribute to others."
positive,new headset: the quality of this is very good. only problem is that i wish the battery would last longer. lasts about 4 hours
positive,"Stunning!: Zelia and her crack band celebrate a yearlong alliance by recording one of their ""rehearsals"" at the Cultural Center in Rio. Beautifully filmed and edited (except for some frontal shots of Zelia where the camera seems to shake), this DVD was recorded one years after the CD of the same name. It's fascinating to hear how the songs evolved after a year of working together. So many highlights, I can't even begin...but will simply mention that Zelia is in top form and wearing a beautiful dress!Just check it out--you'll be glad you did! Maravilhosa!!!Beleza, Zelia!!!!!"
positive,Hobbits review: Great book! I loved the story and Bilbo was an awesome character! So much was put into this book and story and it kept me interested the whole time.
positive,We finally find out how Bruce Wayne became Batman: Awesome movie. Loads of action. Finally find out how Wayne becomes Batman. The 4 previous movies never told you how he became Batman all you knew was he was batman and his parents were killed. In Batman Begins you find out how he becomes Batman. Well worth it. I love the way they set up for the sequel. Katie Holmes is hot.My order of the Batman movies go like this:1)Batman2)Batman Begins3)Batman Returns4)Batman Forever5)Batman and Robin witch was ok but was pretty dumbThe order of the batmans themselves goes like this:1)Micheal Keaton2)Christian bale3)Val KilmarThe worse Batman was George Clooney good actor but not a actor to play Batman sorry George.
negative,"Should have been called ""Inconsistantine"": After hearing this was the best Keanu movie I decided to go see this movie to see what I thought. But this movie was a complete bore. I fell asleep 3 times during the movie, It did not even scare me, I was checking my watch about 15 minutes in. It's supposed to make you scream, but I didn't. I laughed."
positive,A quick read....: .......with basic factual info. A must have if you were recently diagnosed with partial seizures.
positive,Amazon hostess starter set: The starter set was great but the service from Amazon was even better. they handled the lost set with speed and great customer care
positive,"I love this bed! carry it anywhere!: I was little apprehensive before buying an airbed thinking how it would be. But this turned out real nice one. It doesn't need you to call U-haul when you move out. It doesn't require much space to carry it with you anywhere you go. Its also really easy to inflate with the electronic pump and even easier to deflate naturally. After you get used to the ""airbed"", it feels like a normal bed. It offers a great option for people who don't want a hassle of carrying mattress and other accessories along with the trouble of carrying them.It also doesn't require you to carry your pillow. The top surface is velvet like thing that is so soft, you could do w/o a bed sheet also.go for it, if you need one."
positive,"Nice Piatol Carrying/Storage Case: Just as advertised. Very nice, durable, gun transport/storage case. I transport/store my Taurus PT92 9mm pistol and 2 fifteen round magazines ... with enough room for one more. Just like fishing gear, Plano makes great stuff. For the price, it's difficult to compare."
negative,"More of the Same: Same old relationship drama - however, this one involves a minister and his wife. Predictable story and outcome. My biggest gripe was the typeface. Not appealing at all. 2.5 stars."
negative,"Junk plain and simple: great idea the issue is some people (me) dont have the ""flap"" that these fit into on my ear, the top piece needs to be at least 5mm longer to fit without falling out. the teacup ear bud works better.and since i opened it i cant return it way to go amazonif your ears dont have deep folds do not buy these."
positive,"One of my Favorite Books of All Time.: If you're truly looking for a book to ""get lost"" in, this is it. This particular edition is completely fine, no better or worse than any other, but honestly - it's all about the book itself. It's one of those stories you can read a dozen times, and still enjoy, and find something new in."
positive,"nice work ATI: ATI used to forfeit the driver quality game to nVidia, but with the 8500, things seemed to have changed for the better.This is the card to get if you can't afford Nvidia's Geforce4 Ti 4600 or can't find Geforce4 Ti 4200 in stock (as was the case when I bought this card)."
negative,Not Good: Have used this product before and was quite pleased with it so when I saw it on sale at Amazon I bought two bottles. Not sure if what I got was the real stuff or if it was grossly past the expiration date but it did not compare to what I had bought at the Molton Brown store before.I ended up throwing the stuff away and bought a new bottle directly from MB. I will never again buy this product on Amazon. I will buy from a MB store to make sure I get a quality product.
negative,"Not As Good........: This is my least favorite of all the Amityville Horror movies. I find this one boring at times and the acting not so great. Not as many scares and thrills that the first 2 have. The house is still cool! but overall, this part 3 fails to deliver the suspense, etc. that the first 2 deliver. Just disappointing though not terrible."
negative,"What a rip off: I order alot of merchandise from Amazon. But will have real reservations about doing so again. This product I did not realize was not from Amazon and so difficult to return I said lesson learned and kept it. But I will think long and hard about using Amazon again. This product was marked with a sticker that said $0.75 I was charged $3 something and then $3 something for delivery and that was suppose to be free. So I paid $7 dollars for a $.075 book. Not happy next Christmas I will just hit the stores and remember this expierence. Before I told friends Amozon is great so guick and easy , now I say watch out what you are getting some things are a real rip off."
negative,"I know it's a classic, but I was not impressed.: Haing missed this book in school, somehow, I've always meant to read it since I keep hearing great things about it. I don't know if my expectations were too high or I'm just missing something that everyone else sees, but I didn't like it.The idea that political correctness grows into something so ridiculous that not only are books burned, but the houses that they occupy are burned also was just impossible for me to swallow. Add to that only a single character that was likeable at all (and she was killed off pretty early), then a pretty boring story to go along with it, and the only reason I was able to finish it was because it was so short.I don't see any reason why anyone would want to read this book, but I'm clearly in the minority on this one, so maybe you'll like it better than I did."
positive,"Could Brendan be the next Indiana Jones?: I am a huge fan of the Indiana Jones series, and this version of the Mummy has all of the elements that made me like Indi. Action, romance, humor, adventure, thrills, and more. Brendan did a great job as the hero. The cast and acting was quite good and the visual effects were supurb, what else would you expect from ILM. I thought it was a fantastic movie plus all of the extra goodies on the DVD are a plus. DVD is an exciting new format and this movie is a great one to own on it. I also highly recommend The Matrix, Alien Legacy, and Nightmare on Elm St. box set."
negative,"Never try to replace one piece!: I really liked the looks of the Farberware Millenium series. I even bought both sets. My wife let our 3qt sauce pan boil dry and the aluminum melted out between the stainless and copper bottom. I thought no big deal; we will just purchase the individual pan to replace it. Farberware won't do this and unfortunately you have to buy the whole set. I even shipped it to them to see if they would replace it under warranty or in good faith. I had no such luck, they shipped it right back. I will never buy anything Farberware again!"
negative,"really disappointed: Sorry - I try really hard to read every book I start, but I could not finish this one. I found it predictable, silly, and it was not compelling or skilled. The writing was amateurish."
negative,Another Garbage from Japanese Facist.: This is another attempting at dening that atrocity (RAPE OF NANKING) never happened. Sick twisted author like the neo nazi dening Holocaust. Shame on you.
negative,"Failed battery on glue gun: It's a great idea, and when it works it's fine. But the battery stopped holding a charge after just a couple of months. When it did charge it only lasted minutes - not at all useful for anything but a very quick fix. I wouldn't buy another one."
negative,"What a joke!: After 30 years of writing, I guess Stephen's ideas are gone? ""Hole in the Wall?"" What is this... Sound's like Stephen wants to write westerns now! For a fresh taste in modern horror, I would suggest the new author Mark Ventimiglia.Mark is possibly the BEST KEPT SECRET OF MODERN HORROR FICTION! His imagination is gripping and his imagery, vivid! There are many stories in his book (THE RESIDENCE) that defy reality! There is a tale of a ring that eats its owners fingers; a story about a house that is possessed by a spirit of cockroaches and it makes a father whig out and slaughter his family using only sandpaper and a wire brush, there is an awsome Lovecraftian type of tale that vividly shows an innsmouth transformation, and a story about a declawed housecat that extracts vengence on its owner for declawing her. There are many other stories here too, and some poetry, as well as cool art work. What this author was thinking when he wrote these pieces is anyones guess! FANTASTIC!"
negative,"This one is missing that Feehan Spark: This book was a major disappointment. It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehan's other novels (especially Dark Desire) something special. I found the book had very little action, little romance, and a ""mystery"" plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful. This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read."
negative,"Pondmaster Mag pump 9.5B: Purchased a Pondmaster Pump 9.5 as a replacement pump for my Koi pond. Their product is very cheaply made and does not last much longer than their warranty. Shortly after being in use for a little more than a year, the shaft in the impeller broke due to being made of plastic. This is the first impeller I have seen using plastic! This product is not recommended! Replacement parts are available but the cost does not warrant replacing. What will you receive? More plastic!"
positive,"SUBPERB!!!!: Theses are either ""REMASTERED"" or ""EXCELLENT QUALITY REPRODUCTIONS!I'LL SAY IT AND SAY IT AGAIN . . . . SUBPERB!!"
positive,best book ever: This was a wonderful book that had all that a person could want in a fantasy book. A dragon and aboy on a great adventure. Best book I have read in a long time.
negative,"Typos Typos Typos: The typographical errors in all the books of this series, have made this otherwise wonderful book, extremely difficult to read. Not only are there occasional errors, there are repeated errors, in the character's names. I was very disappointed in the quality of the ebook."
negative,"Disappointing: I found this movie to be silly and at times irritating. It did have a few (very few) touching moments, and 1 or 2 chuckles but this is NOT a keeper. The film is blatant in its use of stereotypes (desperate women/weak men). It was hard to be sympathetic with Chris O'Donnell's character, when he was willing to throw away the ""love of his life"" for 100Million $, oh, wait, he was making the sacrifice for his employees. And why was everyone (especially the lawyer) so surprised by the amount of money in the estate?"
negative,Ear Gels: None of them actually fit my ear or the other person I brought them for. They were way too big. If you have small ears don't purchase this item.
positive,"a favorite, reread many times: excellent book, if you haven't read it I am assuming you live in a cave on a remote island....too bad!"
negative,"Buyers Beware: After using this flash drive for multiple types of files I am very very disappointed. At first my only concern was that the USB felt sloppy. But now I can't get this thing to hold any information on my spreadsheets that I use on a daily basis. No matter what I do, I properly eject the device only when I get the message that it is safe. Then I will plug it in again and make sure my spreadsheet is there. Then eject the device again. But when I restart the computer and insert the cruzer my spreadsheets are all kaddywampus with just a portion of the information. It works fine for my word documents and photos, but not spreadsheets. I now purchased a kingston flash drive and pray it works better."
positive,"Of Mice and Men: This action packed book was filled with laughs, and tears. George Milton and Lennie Smalls are best friends. They have been working together for life, and one day plan to have a little house with crops and animals. They both go to work on another farm, and it seems to be working out for them, so that one day their dream can come true. But then Lennie gets into big trouble that costs two peoples lives and affects many others."
negative,"Fabulous Book, Lousy Copy: Not a bad translation, but AVOID AT ALL COSTSThis is an abridged version, and as such a waste and a slap in the face to the author's original vision.I'm doubly upset because I didnt notice this was abridged till I already bought it, and was already 200 pages into it."
negative,"Didn't help: I found research that said this possibly may help get your cycles back and so after finishing the bottle the cycle never came. I guess if you keep it up after a few months is what might help, but I decided instead of buying more and hoping it would help to talk to my doctor first."
positive,"Lord of the Flies, A Society Eye Opener: This book in my opinion is a decent book for a adventure sotry or for a exotic novel. But what it is good at is opening a eye to what our society is really like. Lord of the Flies is about about 20 or so english kids who crash land on a deserted island that know ones knows about. The actual LOTF means Devil or Satan if translated. The Devil in this book sads for the boys evil in killing a pig and putting its head on the stake so the ""beast"" won't kill them. It goes on for a while and then the boys split up and become savages killing 2 kids. This book represents all the flaws in society and how all men (and women) are truly evil at heart. I hope you liek this book and I think you would enjoy reading it."
negative,"Dont Waste Your Time & Money: A total waste of paper - The author enjoys writing words, if you enjoy reading words go for it! If you want any guidance on aspects for retirement and saving for such, spend your time elsewhere - anywhere!"
positive,sweet musings for loss and love: Its a Game and Calling over Time are Edith Frost's best music. There are years between the two albums but the kinship is very very close. Each song on Its a Game will transport you to the world of sweet repose. Much like a summer or autumn friendship that simply fades this music is so hauntingly familiar to the feelings that linger after the time has left you in a state of misty eye wonder.Thanks to Edith for writing so candid and for the music arrangements that are simply perfect for her songs. Again thanks for the kinship and this is highly recommended.
positive,"an addicted fan: I have watched this season within the space of a week. Though only having received it a week before that. I'm finding it hard to write this without spoilling the plot or the characters. I suppose the only way to sum it up is ""if you like the L word and it characters"" buy it. Imo you will like it.I wish we had (I think it it is)hbo I could see the premier of season 5 in january (this may be incorrect)."
negative,"What Is This Trash?: I rented this with high hopes of seeing an excellent and terrifying horror film after hearing that the number one horror fan, Rob Zombie, loves this. I watched it and was sickened by how awful and boring it was. It is mind blowing how little blood there is. One scene, the lead is completely clean and the next she's soaked in what looks like ketchup. And all she does is scream and run in place. Suddenly, she runns into a tree branch. There are absolutely not enough words in the English dictionary to describe how bad this was.Oh, and just thought I'd let everyone know that in it we see Letherface sporting a pair of BLACK HIGH HEELS AND A WOMAN'S FACE!!! What IS this CRAP!!?? If you wanted a good TCM movie, go see the remake because it is out of this world scary, gory, and Oscar-worthy acting.What a waste of my time and money. An hour and a half of my life gone to this trash when I could have had a better time trying to COMMIT SUICIDE!!!"
negative,Wonders of Alaska: Beautiful scenery and certainly a topic of our interest. Tourist vacation souvenir aptly describes this DVD. The narration fails a professional standard; text clearly read with occasional lapses of grammar with a voice sounding much like a teenager rather than one of a well-modulated professional. The package of picture and narration disappoints although the pictures are interesting. At the end of the DVD my guests were more happy that it was over than excited by the act of having seen something beautiful. A bit amateurish was one comment I received.
positive,"Southern Spunk: This book is about three generations of strong southern women. My favorite character by far was the grandmother and matriarch, Charlie Kate. She is a self taught healer, and treats her patients with a combination of common sense and tradition. Charlie Kate is feisty and isn't afraid to speak her mind or take on the powers that be. I also dearly loved the relationship she has with her granddaughter (and of course it made me think of my own grandmothers often)."
positive,"Really pretty: I bought this for myself, and I really like it. The heart and key are very pretty, and as long as you keep it clean, there is a nice sparkle to it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the chain it comes with. It is very thin and easily tangles. I ended up ordering a new thicker chain for it, and now it's perfect."
negative,wacky but lack luster: lots of wacky humor poor quality though not very well made give s bad ideas to kids movie down right is crap
negative,"Dull....Very Dull!: I choose this book because it seemed very interesting, also I had never read a play before. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone. There seems to be no plot and everyone acts encredibly dumb. I have to find three themes to this book and so far NONE!!!!"
positive,"Big Respect to Apple Gabriel: This is a must for reggae lovers. I think this is his 1st album as a solo. Great vibes, nice lyrics, Jah Rastari.Peace, Mo"
positive,"Funniest Movie In A Long Time: Death At A Funeral is the funniest movie I've enjoyed in a long time. Although the title may indicate it to be a maudlin type of movie, it isanything but. The actors, while not a well known group of people, excel at their character roles. It is a bit of British humor that had every American in the theatre, where I first viewed it, and everyone at home viewing the DVD in histerical laughter. Even the credits are hilarious."
positive,"A Book Never to be Forgotten: I am in awe, and at the same time not at all surprised, to find that others who have been touched by this book have searched for it through the years. I can clearly remember when and where it appeared in our tiny school library in the late 1950's. That night, I knew that I had discovered a rare treasure. I truely long to read it again - this story is altogether too timeless to languish out-of-print!"
positive,"Still Resonates: Island is an excellent novel that, even after 50 years, remains relevant because the story line resonates in terms of how we humans consistently, perhaps not consciously, but most assuredly, and maybe even inevitably, undermine the foundations of utopia through our daily actions, decisions and attitudes."
negative,"No Table of Contents: Do not buy this version of Spoon River. The material is great, but this particular edition lacks a table of contents or index, so finding a specific character's monologue is tedious and annoying. Also, I'm not sure of any others, but this edition does not include Dippold the Optician."
positive,Long Walk to Freedom: This CD is classic Ladysmith. They continue to present the songs and rythyms of Africa in their unique style.
positive,"One of my all time favorite books back in print!: A dog-eared copy of this book was read over and over at our house when I was growing up. My mom, an elementary school teacher, used to read it to her class every year. I have since purchased two used paperback versions of the book for my grandchildren, and I'm so happy to see it is being reprinted. I highly recommend this book for adults and children. It's a one-evening read for an adult, but I promise you will enjoy it."
negative,"Where is Sasha?????: I don't know what went wrong, but latest albums from the best djs like Sasha and Paul Oakenfold are really far away from the ""magic music"" they used to play for the global underground series, they became kings in the field of progressive house and for any reason they started to explore in others different fields.This new album from Sasha unfortunately is not what we all his fans were expecting, be ready for chill out, the party is over!!!"
positive,"Excellent Story: Love Robert Parker and his characters and Sunny Randall is fun to listen to. Family Honor was a great story. I purchased this copy second hand, however, and it was listed as top quality and it was not - 2 of the discs had spots with sound problems. I was still able to get the story alright and enjoyed it a great deal...fun to listen to."
negative,"Just really terrible: At first I kinda liked the album although it wasn't much to listen to . After a few more listens it just fell apart . Added to this was that the feeling you had heard all the songs before and by now it had really begun to grate on your nerves . It has the feeling of one song been sped up and slowed down and there are incidental words just thrown across it every now and then without thinking of the consequences . If you are a pop loving soul , then by all means buy this album ( if you haven't got it already ). If like Eminem ( which I also don't like but I think he's got a point with Moby ) then just don't listen to this . If you are looking for some really nice ambient dance music may I suggest The Orb or Boards Of Canada . They make music with a lot more imagination than you'll hear from this pile of waste"
negative,"Like it, looks great but ...: Purchased 3 of these faucets at Sam's club for less than $50 each. While installing I discovered that the waterspout does not swivel. If I had known this prior to purchase I would probably not have bought this particular fixture. Needless to say that a spout hanging this far over the sink causes some awkwardness and hazard while trying to wash ones face, either by bumping your head or scraping your hands on the spout. I called tech support at Corrego and was told the spout does not swivel and there is no accessory part that will allow it to swivel. Great looking fixture but not very practical."
positive,"Pleasantly surprised: I picked this one up on a whim, aware of Thackery's history with the Nighthawks. If you like to hear real fretboard mastery, give this one a shot. While he has a sound truly his own, you'll definately hear some of his influences: Buddy Guy and SRV were obvious idols of his. This purely instrumental CD covers nearly all aspects of of the 12-bar march, too. Jazz, chicken picking, a bit of country, jump, swing--an ...-kicking extravaganza. Get it, you won't be disappointed. As a fellow guitar slinger, I've been humbled!!"
positive,"OUTSTANDING STRAIGHT TO YOUR HEART: I must say, my wife hassled me month after month to watch this 8 hour movie. But with all the other things I rather have been doing, I just put it off. All the Action, Adventure, blood and guts, horror, etc. But for her birthday, anything. Then I watched it, tape after tape. Surprisingly, after my wife fell asleep, the movie still kept my interest. Anne of Green Gables was a very I don't know how to put it... Words from the mouth can not describe it. But what can describe it is all the words from your heart. It touched me, for the rest of my life. Started from nothing, then receiving a little, and then giving EVERYTHING. Very touching!"
positive,"Dreams and Hopes: I have seen ""The Million Dollar Hotel"" in a German movie theater. The German producer Wim Wenders and frontman Bono from U 2 are the two men who created this movie. It is a romantic thriller which plays in downtown Los Angeles in the year 2001. The junkie Izzy Goldkiss, son of a media mogul, is found dead. FBI Agent Skinner (Mel Gibson) starts his investigation in the hotel, where Izzy had lived. The hotel is a shelter for the poor with no medical insurance. The prostitute Eloise (Milla Jovovich) and the dreamer Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies) are only two of the people who Skinner is questioning. It is a story about friendship, trust, betrayal and the powerful strength of an unconditional love in front of a criminal investigation ... and at the end even Skinner does not know who is guilty or not guilty, insane or not insane. Great movie, unfortunately not played in every movie theater in the United States. Not available on VHS or DVD yet."
positive,"Great, encouraging read!: Loved it! Gives you great insight on the fundamentals of living a progressive life, ""The ultimate self-help book,"" even for those not seeking one"""
positive,Fast and in good shape: It Came to me pretty fast and was in good shape when I opened it. Very happy with it. Thanks
negative,Arrived defective: Bought three of them for use around the house to replace one that I have had for years.All three produced a strong odor of burning plastics and electronics.
positive,"I couldn't put it down!!: A set of wonderful stories about REAL people that rose to the challange of Nazi Germany and with our allies eventually defeated that threat.I do have one small observation. All my life people of my grandparents generation ""The Greatest Generation"" have been telling that if there was ever another crisis like World War 2 we couldn't handle it. Well we did a preety good job after September 11th didn't we?"
negative,"A great disservice.: While Shaw may have been a gifted playwright, his ""Saint Joan"" did an enormous disservice to the subject: the view it presents of Joan of Arc conflicts with the historical evidence on nearly every point, echoing instead the propaganda of her enemies. In truth, her trial was orchestrated by the English and their clerical allies (and even Shaw admits that the Inquisition overturned the verdict in 1456, shortly after the English were finally driven out of Rouen); nor was Joan a ""rebel"" except in the minds of her political opponents. By dredging up this fraudulent view of La Pucelle, Shaw's play was among the first popular works to undermine the efforts of countless scholars whose research had brought a more truthful view of the issue to light. For an historically accurate version, I would recommend any book by Regine Pernoud, many of which are offered here at Amazon."
positive,Awsome!: This is a very good movie. My sister and i really enjoyed it. It is not the modern day war etc. movies it is a nice classic movie with a cool plot.It is awsome.
negative,"Ms Nettleton seems sincerely deluded ... :-0: This book is hilarious, evidently written toungue-in-cheek. It is also at least to some extent fictitious, regarding her personal experiences, so perhaps it is best read as such.One example of this is that she states her fourth husband ""Bill"" 'has no children of his own'. This is untrue. He has three children he adopted and then chose to walk out on. Perhaps Ms. Nettleton was unaware of this fact at the time her book went to print. That would, however, not really speak well to her doing due diligence on her suitors before marrying them!"
positive,"Awesome Book, Can't Wait for More: The whole series of these books so far, Into the Wild, and Fire and Ice, are some of the greatest books i have ever read. I really love the battle scenes,and hope hope hope hope hope that Erin Hunter will continue the series and write another (bk. 5).an awesome read."
positive,"Great sounds!: I purchased this item for my son when he was 6 months old. He truley loves it! He is 2 now and still plays with it! The best part is the ""easy to listen to"" music! The fishbowl has not become annoying like many infant/ toddler toys do."
negative,"Meh...: Glossy. Pretty to look at. Gorgeous apartments, pretty people, sexy sound track. But, tries to be funny and it so isn't. Tries to be smart and it so isn't. Uma tries to act well but she doesn't. Poor Meryl. So not worthy of her talent.Skip it."
positive,"Rice is delicious when fresh, but gets dry after awhile: My wife and I use this to makeRoland Premium Jasmine Rice from Thailand. We haven't played around with the settings for other types of rice yet, but this rice comes out delicious when the cycle first finishes.The only problem is that after the rice has been left in the cooker overnight, it tends to dry out. I believe that this is a common problem with rice cookers, though."
positive,"Now I want to meet them: This is a sensational book! I don't want to sleep on the ground. I want a bed and privacy. My husband wants to go fishing and golf. This book gives us the opportunity to do trips together and make both of our desires come true. So far we've tried three of the cottages, and they were just as Stephani & Tom said they were. Sounds like they have the dream life!"
negative,"OOPS! WRONG BOOK!!: This book reads like a dervative of a badly written derivative of Tolkien, married to the son of ""Dark and Stormy Night."" The annual contest of Groaner openings needs a new entry, maybe that way, FtM could get recognized! Books should be FUN to read, this one is a chore. I have tried three different times to pick it up, but have failed miserably. My last attempt died after less than a chapter. One of the other reviewers used the word ""Execrable,"" if he hadn't, I would have.I haunt my local Half Price Books and snap up anything by my list of favorite authors that appears on their shelves. Eric Flint is on that list. He has done some very nice collaborative work, so I looked forward to reading FtM. OOPS! WRONG BOOK! I am not ready to give up on Flint, so I will blame his partner for the miserable writing. I don't think I will read any more of Roach's work."
negative,"One of the worst movies ever: Hey Im open to wrestlers acting in movies. The Rock is doing it, Hogan did it for a bit. I did enjoy wwe's other movies but this...this was just plain bad. Cena has to be one of the worst actors to ever get a starring role in a movie released in theaters. Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back. WWE could have easily found someone better. Skip this movie. In fact do someone a favor, buy the dvd and destroy it so no one would have to witness this horrible movie. I would give it a 0 if I could. Nothing about this movie is good"
positive,Great but I got the wrong one: I got the movie on time and everything brand new the problem is I thought it would work in my samsung surround sound HD theater but it didn't. I can't really tell you anything other than I wish I can see how good it looks LOL. You will get your DVD on time though
positive,"Some people just don't understand...: I can't fathom how anybody can hate this movie. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are absolutely phenomenal. What a great story. I watch this movie over and over and it captivates me every time. The music is perfect...the acting is perfect...the story is gripping. People are upset because the film never fully explains itself in the end. It allows the viewer to interperet the film's meaning on their own and draw their own conclusions. I have my own, but due to the risk of offending certain demographs, my thoughs shall remain my own. Besides...I would hate it if a first time viewer were to read this review and have a picture already in their head. Watch this fantastic film and make up your own mind and don't let anybody tell you that your interperetation is wrong! There is no such thing as a incorrect interperetation of a piece of artwork be it a sculpture, piece of music, or a film with imagery like this!P.S. - BUY THE SOUNDTRACK, TOO! It's absolutely incredible."
positive,Installs onto Win 7 without any problems...: Had upgraded an office computer to Windows 7 and the old machine had SmartSuite 97 installed and a ton of *.123 files. SmartSuite 97 will not work on Windows 7 (at least not without giving you a significant headache) and when I heard that SmartSuite MIL edition worked I thought $30 was a bargain for a headache free usage of Lotus Smartsuite on Windwos 7 - really a no brainer if you ask me!
positive,"I have the conch...let me speak!: OK now that I have the conch I have a few things I'd like to say about this book. First if you don't know what the conch is all about then you'd better pick up this book and read it. Secondly if you think you know who the Lord of Flies might be without reading this book your wrong. Third and lastly do yourself a favor anyway and pick up this book, it's a fun, quick read. I liked this story of young boys stranded on a island having to fend for themselves and at the same time trying to keep some sort of organization among themselves as they wait for a possible rescue. But therein lies the problem as their little world begins to turn up-side down as different personalities begin to clash. I felt as though I too was on the island with these kids as I read along. I've said enough now, who wants the conch now?"
positive,steps of corruption: I think that this book is a great example of how corruption can begin and infectiously spread through a seemingly good group of boys. It is great for teenagers and adults to read to see how easy it really is to fall into the bad crowd because you are scared of being a leader of your life and future.
positive,"Excellent Book!: I love C.S. Lewis. His writings always amaze and teach me new ways of understanding and looking at something. This is one of his greatest works. This book is very deep so is sometimes difficult to comprehend if reading quickly. It is a book that must be read slowly, allowing lots of time to think, reflect, and process the thoughts of C.S. Lewis. I highly recommend Mere Christianity."
negative,"Nothing new here!: I am a HUGE Sedaris fan. Can say he is my favorite author. Have paid to see him speak any chance I can get. This book disappointed me. Not as funny as the others and the only ""laugh out loud"" moments I had were reading the two chapters I had already read. ""The Ship Shape"" I heard him read over a year ago in Redwood City, CA, and another chapter - Paul's wedding chapter - I had also read somewhere but can't remember where. I was very disappointed. Looks like he's lost his touch."
negative,"Expensive and not so good: Until I moved to the us I used only pampers, but I have to say that the us pampers are less good and more expensive then the israeli version.My children wake up in the middle of the night due to wet diaper, with the Israeli version of pampers it never happend"
positive,"kawasaki 840015 10 piece heat gun: bought it 2 years ago , worked fine on what i needed it for . and it's still working today, well worth the price"
positive,"Another Excellent Achievment: This book was another wonderful addition to the Xanth series. As with all of the Xanth books, it was a book that I could not stop reading. The book was interesting from beginning to end. To experience yet another adventure with the well known characters was a real treat, and gets better with each book."
negative,"be sure to check the discs: As many have stated, I also got the wrong disc. After reading the last few reviews, I was hoping the problem was fixed. So not only am I missing the stop action ""year without a Santa Claus"", but the other two shows too. I've yet to try to return it or contact anyone, but why should this problem still be happening? Customers shouldn't have to return discs or make calls for a problem that has been known for over a year. I feel this doesn't speak well of Amazon.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I wrote to Amazon and within hours I received an email and will receive a refund. However in order for me to purchase it from another seller, it will cost a bit more. I hope I receive the right disc this time."
positive,"What has been missing in music for decades!!!!!!!!!: I love every song on this CD. Clay has proven himself to be be a powerhouse. What a voice and the way he sings Perfect Day absolutely hitting all those high notes. As for Broadway, Broadway couldn't handle what he would bring to the stage. His voice is so pure, so rich and I get chills with each song he gives us."
negative,"Horrible Acting: I read the play Romeo and Juliet in my Shakespeare class, and thought is was a very good play. But when I saw this movie I was very dissapointed. The acting in the movie is just HORRIBLE.On all the parts, it is either overdone or underdone.And on top of that,they cut out alot of dialogue toward the end.I think there is a reason why Shakespeare wrote these plays for the stage. I would reccomend the version with Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Daines over this one."
negative,Lasted 1/2 hour: I used the cordless grass shears 1 time. It cut mounds ofgrass though very slowly. Second time the motor soundedstrong but neither grass or shrub blade worked at all.I am waiting to hear back from the co. on replacement.
positive,maze puzzle: wonderful design. our grandsons love it. and their mom loves it as no pieces to pick up. very well built--and built in the usa!
positive,Good Value: I purchased two sets of these speakers for two computers I just put together for my children. The sound is actually pretty good for the price of these units. I am very satisfied with these speakers.
negative,"For clueless guys only: This book is for guys who have absolutely no idea about how to please a woman. The book reads like a technical manual, reducing sex to a series of specific tasks, and telling us how women supposedly respond to kisses and touches. Not all women will respond in the same way, and the important thing is to be sensitive to the clues she is sending you, not to necessarily spend x amount of time kissing or touching one specific part of her anatomy. There are better books on pleasing a women, e.g. ""The Sex You Want."""
negative,"Another ""million little pieces"": Anyone who's been to Lafayette, IN knows this story streches the truth....a lot! In one part, the author claims that the students at Harrison High School have ""probably never seen a real live black person before."" (pg 6). Really? Because I know some African Americans who have graduated from Harrison!! I'm not saying Lafayette is not over 1/2 white (it is) but Scheeres should stick to fiction, because this book can hardly be called a ""memoir"".It's another 'million little pieces', a ""memoir"" that's 'spiced up' with fiction to sell more books."
negative,"I'm disappointed! :o(: We recently were looking for the peaceful planet aquarium from fisher price. My friend's new baby has it and my son loved it. The lights are wonderful, the music is great, and the kids adore it. But, as fisher price often does, they discontinued it and made the ocean wonders aquarium. I do not like this toy! I most definetly would not recommend buying this for your little one. The music is loud even on the lowest volume setting and the music is anything but soothing! The lights are a crude white in contrast to the soft blue of the peaceful planet aquarium and unlike the peaceful planet aquarium, the ocean wonders aquarium does not have the window that projects the light onto the ceiling and walls. I am extremely disappointed with my purchase. My son does not care for the toy, either. (Which is most important!)"
negative,"Very potent juice, too much for my personal nose: This is a beautiful fragrance for those who adore something heavy, almost syrupy, to wear. It's a very deep, sweet and spicy scent, kind of like Estee Lauder's Spellbound, which is also too heavy for my own personal taste. But some people review this most enthusiastically, so it's worth giving it a try. The price is right, so not a huge loss if it doesn't do it for you."
negative,"excessive violence: Too much violence associated hard to stare at the screen or follow the storyline....if one can tolerate, you would enjoy this satire."
positive,"Is anybody here rating the Tab book instead of the album?: Great album. Always was, always will be, one of my favorites. Went looking for a guitar tab book on Amazon. Found one that said it had 542 reviews for it. Opened a review; not about the book, about the album. Opened another, and another, and another, you get the picture. Nice going Amazon."
negative,"poor: This book's reputation as a classic reveals less about the book than it does about the shallowness and mediocrity of many book critics. It is crude, heavy-handed, superficial propaganda."
positive,Excellent Right Out of the Box: Tivo's software for this unit enabled us to hook-up them up to our two Pioneer-57H's right out of this box. A well-designed product!
positive,"Old time reading: One must, of necessity, of course, deal with a most classic Victorian style; however, get over it and read it. Read ""Frankenstein."""
negative,"The Band of Gypsy's Return Review: Well, no -- Hendrix would not sound like this. He used three 100Watt Marshall stacks pushed at full volume to derive unbelievable tones from his guitar. Simply put -- there's not much tone on this album, nor sustain, nor overtones that come from Marshalls on 10. Yeah, there's talented guitarists, like Andy Aledort, but the notes seem to die out. Obviously, you can't hook up a series of Marshall stacks in a studio without blowing the studio out, but anything less than the stage tone from the Fillmore East recording 69/70, is a sub-par re-recording of that famous set."
negative,"Adorable toy box, nightmare to assemble: This circus toy box is vibrant and fun looking, but the holes Guidecraft bored into it are too small to properly fit the screws.If you're looking for a unique, pretty toy box, then this is one to consider. However, you should have a drill and your own screws on hand to complete its assemblance. Then you'll be glad you bought it. Otherwise, this product is bound to frustrate you."
positive,"Clay's star continues to shine ......: What can I say about this amazing guy? He just never stops amazing me. It seems with each song he sings ... each interview he gives ... he just gets better and better. Measure Of A Man is a perfect example of this. Whether it's upbeat cuts like ""Invisible"" or ""Touch"" or wonderful, touching songs like ""Run To Me"", ""The Way"", or ""I Will Carry You"" ... it's clear Clay has the voice, talent, and personality to be the next big thing on the music scene. Although never having met Clay, I am so proud of all that he's already accomplished (You go, Clay!!) ... and look forward to seeing his star shine on, and on."
positive,"Savage and brutal: This is a great, great cd. As the first Mayhem release with the current lineup, they came right out of the box with a masterpiece of unanticipated power. Each track is just monstrous in every way; and the production is some of the very best you'll likely ever hear on a black metal release. Note that this contains the first part of their epic full- length release ""Grand Declaration Of War"", so be sure to buy both. You won't be disappointed if raw, seriously dangerous metal is what you're looking for."
negative,Never received: Never received it! Don't know why it never downloaded - so don't know why I got this request for review.
positive,"Entertaining and Useful: How To Talk To Your Cat is divided into ten sections, each devoted to a different aspect of cat care and communication.I immensley enjoy Patricia Moyes's style of writing; her tone is both professional, yet she also has a good sense of humor. This makes the book fun to read, while also providing helpful information.A lot of the verbal communication that she mentions (including the silent miaow, the ""welcome home!"" chirp, etc.) I could smile and nod my head at, knowing that my cats do the exact same thing."
negative,Worst diapers in the world: This was the worst diaper product we ever purchased. Store brands are far better than this popular product. Probably because it was on sale....Do not buy it if you care about your baby
positive,"Nescafe Clasico Instant coffee ....... GREAT!!!: My husband and I drink instant coffee every morning before going to the office. For a long time I've been seeking the perfect coffee maker to elevate our coffee drinking pleasure, but for many reasons it's just simpler, quicker and hotter to drink instant coffee. So, you might call me an instant coffee connoisseur, because I've tried nearly all the instant varieties available at our local market. I can't say I adore any of them, but Nescafe rises to the top of the list when I rank them by taste, aroma and creme."
negative,"Horrible: Worst instructional video I have ever used. She talks and talks and talks and moves real fast. I had an extremely difficult time catching up to her and then she is on to the next move.The video starts with about 20 minutes of advertisement and the next 20 minutes is just watching her move. You must use the remote to find the ""instructional"" part. What a waste. I just wish I could get her address and let her know I will never buy anything with her name on it."
positive,"J. Montgomery brings up some good points, but: J. Montgomery, the guy below me, almost below me, or that was below me, brings up some good points. If I grade using his system, cause after all this isn't English class, then Eragon gets 3.75 stars.I read it in a few days. That merits five stars, I suppose, but the lack of suspence and emotion detracted from the fact that I read it quickly. I have only read a handful of books faster, and they are, Harry Potter 5&6 and Hawksong, by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. They all got five stars from me, but they had something Eragon didn't, and for the moment, I'll call that heart.Thank you for allowing me to bore you...but one more thing. If you grade this book as if in an English class, based on technicallities, then Eragon scrapes two stars...."
positive,Dramatic & Emotional!: This is a great drama showing how the misleading enticements of the Hitler regime to the German youth to join their training camps doesn't work when the two lead youth reveal that they do indeed have hearts with compassion for each other and their fellow mankind. It is very captivating and unpredictable with a very emotional ending.
negative,"Not nearly as good as the first movie: I had never read the books, but I really enjoyed the first 'Narnia' movie. Seemed like a pleasant mix of child literature and fantasy writing, and that movie was a pleasant surprise (part 'Harry Potter', part 'Lord of the Rings'). This new one isn't nearly as good though; the acting seems more stilted, the story isn't as interesting, and the religious overtones are much more prevalent. I was looking forward to this, but can't recommend it others"
positive,"Best CD Ive heard this year!: I cant say that Jimmy Lafave really meant all that much to me. Apart, that is, from Going Home, a better song than Bruce Springsteen, for example, ever wrote (although Dead Man Walking comes close). But Trail is a gem in its entirety. Lafave manages to sing songs by the likes of Dylan and Springsteen better than Dylan and Springsteen, as if they were his own. Going Home, by the way, is on it too. It is the heartbraching ache in Lafaves voice that will never stop to amaze me. And touch me, like very few voices do. Absolutely brilliant!"
negative,"This printer does have paper feed problems!: For those who doubt the user, be assured this printer does have paper feed problems. Some users have good experiences but it the problem lies in the printer. I have been a network consultant for 10 years and I fix all the computer hardware problems for my company. This printer feed problem is not something that can be fixed by reading the manual. For your information, I am using HP Color Inkjet paper. It printed a few pages fine in the beginning then started jamming on every single sheet. I have to manually help it along by pushing each page for it to catch the paper. Sometimes it just grabs a stack of 30 sheets. It has a poor paper pick up design and that is a fact."
negative,"The mask of Zero: Apparently, the only path to wisdom and a life packed with acts of kindness is arse freezing and sword and/or kickboxing tricks.Ridiculous movie designed for brainless pimpled teenagers.Nauseating philosophy wrapping grandiloquent dialogues.At least the Rambo suite was honest entertainment."
negative,"Zero Resolution: I'm sure I am one of a select few that do not appreciate a story that develops great characters and great sub-plots and then ends abruptly. It's almost as though the author got bored and quit - Zero resolution on anything. It doesn't leave me wanting more because I know the same feeling of ""What the Hell?"" will be waiting for me in the next book."
negative,"FRUSTRATING: Too complicated and very frustrating. One player continues to get repeat turns while the others wait and wait. This game produced tantrums and hurt feelings in my 3 children (ages 7, 7 and 10). We received this game as a gift, and I am planning to return it to the store. Kids don't need to be quizzed on Disney movies."
negative,"Wrong Message: What a waste of resources...This biopic is completely by-the-book, telling the story in an academic, uninspired, predictable way. The characters are all cardboard, and lead Milla Jovovich is over-the-top and not credible as Joan of Arc. This movie has no spark or life whatsoever, moving at a snail`s pace and failing to engage. The settings and costumes are decent, but that`s all there is to find here.Director Luc Besson also made the useless ""The Fifth Element"", and the style-over-substance perspective of that movie is present here, too. This is just a bunch of random fight sequences and melodramatic moments that go nowhere and generate a messy cinematic experience. A lackluster movie and one to avoid."
positive,"A DESCENT INTO A HORRIFIC ADVENTURE!: WOW, what a treat writer/director Neil Marshal did on just his 2nd directorial tryout! Dog Soldiers was OK, but Descent is by far and away superior in every way.Like the lackluster American version called - THE CAVE - the British version - The Descent - is written bettter, with less special effects. That should teach and show directors out there that special effects ain't everything. A solid plot is first. Good actors is 2nd. Special effects comes 3rd. Not the other way around.Although both movies only touch very little on the hugely sucessful, bestseller novel, The Descent, by Jeff Long, both movies could have greatly benefited if they could have done the movies much more closely to the novel. Would have cost much more, but would have been a gigantic blockbuster at the movie houses.But if you like gritty, scary movies, with a great twist at the end, then you must get this. Excellent horror adventure."
positive,"A Pleasent, Engaging album...: Novembre's Materia is a wonderful mix of Dark Rock, Alternative, and Acoustic Rock. Songs like Memoria Stoica/Vetro, Croma and Nothijngrad are standouts, dawdling, encompassing songs that revolve around wonderful vocals, (mostly sung in Italian). This is a strong, steady, album that doesn't let you down as it progresses through the mature songs."
positive,"good effort: I was curious to see what this bunch of 60+ guys are still capable of, and I knew it was generally considered a good effort, so I bought this the other day.Simple, kick-arse R'n'R is what I love; I also enjoy anyone sticking it to the Idiot in Chief - which is why I like Rough Justice and Sweet Neocon the most.Rough Justice is just great R'n'R.Many seem to have critiqued Sweet Neocon on two levels: as just a political message, and as a song.For me, I don't think you can separate the two. I see part of R'n'R as always being about rebellion, so the fact that the sound is rebellious just adds bite to the sarcasm of the lyricsas for the rest, none of it really grabs me that much, personally. Particularly the bluesy numbers, as my taste is R'n'R.I rate it 4 stars, because I think it's a good effort, just most of it doesn't appeal hugely to my taste."
negative,the biggest rip off ever and i didn't see this dvd: im hearing from other reviewers that this is only 45 minutes long. i like celebrity deathmatch but not this. what they should do is release the entire series. thats what they really should do.
negative,"meh: Like the past few efforts from grisham, this one catches it's stride after a couple of boring chapters, keeps you plodding along out of mild curiosity, blazes through a bunch of frivilous events near the end, then plunges you off a cliff with no climax, and a confusing ""resolution"". My love for courtroom novels, and grisham's earlier work keep me searching for his long awaited return to form. This isn't it."
negative,"1984: 1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member or the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere he goes he is video taped by cameras of the so called ""Big Brother"" party. This books talks about Winston on how he thinks what the ""Big Brother"" does is unfair. I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Wiston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction. Overall it was a good book, but I don't think Iam ever going to want to read this book again."
negative,"Terrible book: This is a bad book with many mistakes (not just spelling mistakes but design and interpretation mistakes!!). The author do not have seems to have hands-on experience in ESD and not known in ESD area, which is clear from his approach. Do not waste the money..If you are a designer, go and buy the book by Maloney and Dabral.If you are a device engineer, buy the book by Duvvury and Amerasekera."
positive,"odd,wonderful,unique,music for (but not by) musicians.: I first heard of the Shaggs from a friend who went on and on about how bad this music was and how it was totally foreign to anything he had ever heard. The way he ranted and raved, I thought he must be exagerating about it, but when I heard it I had to admit that he hadn't even come close to describing this stuff. I have listened to the songs many times over and am still challenged to follow the drum patterns. Like one of the other reviewers said, whwn you listen to it a lot, it starts to make sense in some wierd kind of way. These girls could only be sisters because you would have to share the same demented genes to be able to understand what they are doing intuitively. For anyone with a musical background it is very hard to follow. Like the late, great Frank Zappa said ""Better than the Beatles, even today!"" ENJOY!"
negative,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!: I saw this a few weeks ago with a friend, both of us kept looking at our watches to see how much longer before the torture would end, this movie was SLOW SLOW SLOW, with no real plot. It had some great actors in it too bad they were in such a horrible movie!"
negative,nice but could have dont better: Works as advertised it has three lift stations on it to accommodate any size of bike. Though if has no foam edging for the floor (hardwood) so it likes to slide a little when peddling fast or standing while pedaling. Is also a little bulky think I could have found something a little smaller
positive,British Cinema Collection: 8 Acclaimed Films: I couldn't believe 8 movied for less than I usually pay for one. Someof my favorite actors wer in these & I thoroughly enjoyed the films.
positive,Awesome Harlemm: Harlemm has shown his talents in this album. I love his songs. I can feel the effort and all his spirit that he put into his music.
negative,"Wrong format, I ordered or should have orderd DVD and got VCR: I am in the process of changing all of my movies from VCR Casettes to DVD becausse my player for the cassettes broke and cannot be replaced. I had the VCR version of this already. Don't know who made the mistake"
negative,Live and Learn: Bought the Tivo 80 hr. Video Recorder to hook up to a security camera. Was advised it should work. Tuner arrived with no instructions and full of previous owner's old recordings. Could not get instructions on TiVo's internet site and have not yet been able to get it to work. We keep getting error msg. that we have to be a TiVo subscriber to use it. Will probably just throw it in the trash where it belonged in the first place.
negative,amer graffitti review: this dvd lasted about 20 minutes and then stopped never mad e it through the whole movie once....
positive,"Almost Perfect: The n800 is a very powerful hand gadget. It is NOT a replacement for a laptop or desktop, but can do almost everything a pc can do. Thanks to the open source OS there are updated OS's periodically to upgrade to. There is also a lot of home brew/ported apps that can be used. One favorite app is pidgin IM to keep in touch with friends, and Erming which syncs google calendar and GPE calander on the n800 and can display upcoming calender events and to do's. The internet is a 9/10, only because the heavy flash sites can bog the browser down(but at least it has flash & external speakers..Ipod hmmph). Web pages are REAL web pages and can zoom in and out. Also there is a tweak to make sites think you are on a iphone browser and display them is an iphone would. There is too much to say what it can do, but I suggest you get one."
negative,"If you want your kid to end up on welfare read them this book...: The message in this book is reflective of the overall tone of American society these days: ""Don't have ambition or push yourself, simply settle for what makes you comfortable and you'll be happy."" The book blatantly puts a negative spin on the characters in the book that are striving to push themselves outside of their comfort zone and grow in some fashion. I know some of you are thinking ""hey man, it's a kids book, lighten up"", but you know as well as I that our kids minds are very malleable at a young age and messages like this can and will shape their worldviews as they grow up. Imagine an entire generation of people who refused to push themselves because it was too hard or too uncomfortable. This nation rose to the top for the very reason that people pushed themselves and took risks that were uncomfortable. My recommendation: if you see this book, burn it."
negative,Weak remake: I found this recent remake of the classic very weak. Stewart's potrayal of Ahab didn't have any of the power of Gregory Peck's 1956 character.The camera work was also terrible. Land is clearly seen in several scenes where the men are supposedly many months out to sea.
negative,"NOT WATER PROOF: Don't waste your money buying this tent. I went on a week-long camping trip, and the second night, we had a rain storm. It rained IN THE TENT. The rain fly did nothing, water was dripping from the ceiling, and all down the sides. I was so dissapointed, not to mention soaking wet. I plan on returning it asap."
positive,"The ressurection of the epic movies: For such a long time, the roman empire kept off the silver screens. But it returns in a majestic way. This huge producton is one of the best movies of the year, with espectacular sets, a wonderful plot, amazing visual effects and a Russel Crowe like we've never seen before. Who would imagine Russle Crowe as a gladiator? Ridley Scott adds another great movie to his sucesseful career. Gladiator is also one of the possible nominations for the oscars of best suporting actor (Oliver Reed) ,for example. I'm not making publicity but, if you can, buy it! Buy it now!"
negative,"Absolutely blah!: I don't know what I was expecting when I purchased this book! It is a journal, but the spaces allotted for each day are quite small. Perhaps the author didn't anticipate that some people have large handwriting or that others would have a lot to say. I never used it, and would not recommend it. Buy a journal with larger spaces!"
positive,"Toxicity- Intelligent Punk Metal: Toxicity is easily one of the best releases of the year, in any genre. System of a down has taken heavy metal and interlaced it with melody and arabic influences to create an entirely new and different sound. It is heavy metal, so the faint hearted may find it a little hard to get past the sheer heaviness of the album. Daron and Serj's lyrics are at times very direct (""Prison Song,"" ""Deer Dance,"" and definetly ""Bounce"") and at other times quite mysterious (""Toxicity,"" ""Chop Suey""). Overall, a great album. They showed heaps of promise and their excellent but occasionally poor debut, and delivered on every sliver of it. Very highly recomended. High points on the album include ""Chop Suey!"", ""Prison Song,"" ""Aerials"", and ""Shimmy."""
positive,"Great story !: The performance of all actors, especially Gerard Depardieu is top-notch. The story has a sad ending, but thought provoking. The excitement, energy and the fierce determination of Jean de Florette is inspiring. This city dweller is so determined to succeed as a farmer that he will give up under no circumstance. Beware that the French spoken in this movie is not the Parisian French, the Provence accent makes it very hard to understand, in case you are a student of French. (There are French subtitles too, besides English, so that helps a lot)."
positive,Excellent: I bought this to give temporary window coverings for our living room windows. It was inexpensive and easy to install. I'm very pleased.
positive,"Victoria and Albert: I love this movie for so many reasons, but first and foremost is the classic love story between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of England. Theirs is a love story for the ages. I love period pieces and I love English history and this is one of my all time top 10 favorite movies. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone whether you love English history or if you just love a great love story. Victoria Hamilton and Jonathan Firth play Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to perfection and are both superb actors. A very well acted movie with a great story. I would highly recommend."
positive,"No paradise in Hawaii: Matt is off to Hawaii for a vacation -- or is it? Wiley old Mac is up to his tricks again to get more mileage out of his agents. This story finds Matt pitted against an old adversary called, ""Monk"" that has a grudge. Matt wins the girls, battles the bad guys -- Russian and Chinese, and some from his own agency. Donad Hamilton does it again as he keeps you guessing with a plot that constantly thickens. Great reading."
negative,Ripped Off: This situation goes back to September 2010!! THIS PURCHASE DEMANDS A SUBZERO PRODUCT RATING.The 12 Gillette Fusion Blades were copies not made by Gillette. DULL AS A HOE!! When I contacted Amazon I was told that the money that I paid would be refunded and a new cartridge of GILLETTE blades would be sent. (Email Documentation is available..) As of this date none of the promises has been met.Be careful about your purchases!!!I'm through with Amazon.-- Don --
positive,"Nanci Griffiths ""Other Voices Other Rooms "" A great Video: I bought the album as soon as it was released in New Zealand after seeing Nanci on the Bob Dylan anniversary concert video singing ""Spanish Boots of Spanish Leather"". Apart from this video and the guest appearance with the Chieftans it was hard to obtain videos of Nanci in this country. I have most of her albums. This video is superb. The quality of the concert production is excellent. The background dialog gives you an appreciation of her background. The songs performed are not exactly as per the album which is a bonus as you get to appreciate other ways of producing the songs. The feeling that comes over is the commitment and honesty of Nanci. She communicates with her audience on an awesome level and this is translated into the viewer's experience. This video is a must for all Nanci fans and lovers of mainstream country.David Askew,Auckland, New Zealand"
positive,"Pretty Darn Good Stuff: I confess, I was somewhat skeptical of the talents of a 14 yr. old girl...but I pretty much had my socks blown off when I heard Stacie's CD. It's a great listen, and will have you dancing in front of your mirror and singing along after the first listen-through. The catchy lyrics and R&B rhythms are fantastic and the songs really reflect well the conflicts of a teenage girl who has a relationship with God...she's not just singing about stuff she can't relate to. I'd recommend this to anyone."
negative,"Champion of Love: The Champion of Love Song is not the regular classic sung by the Cathedrals for example. If you're looking for that song sung by Glad, this album doesn't have it. There is only one a cappella song on this cd and it is the same one found on The A Cappela Project, God Is My Rock."
positive,"One of Van Damme's best: First of all, this movie should have been released theatrically instead of going straight to Video. But since the DVD is here, Van Damme's fans (and action fans) should check it out. It is far better than his last 4 or 5 films (which are very bad: Desert heat, Universal soldiers: The return, Double Team, Knock off).The story about cloning but director Ringo Lam made this movie highly entertaining. Van Damme plays double role, one is the serial killer, the other role as his clone which created so the police can catch the serial killer. Interestingly, Michael Rooker co-stars, he also appears in other cloning movie starring Arnold (The sixth day).The DVD is OK. Bright and clear and the sound is fine. Van Damme provided commentary tracks along with ROoker, which are quite amusing. REcommended."
negative,"Quite a bit less editorializing would have been nice: I guess I need to look a little closer at what I'm looking to check out in the future when it comes to non-fiction, as this was aimed just a LITTLE bit below my comprehension.The biggest issue with the book is that rather than presenting the facts of the various matters in a strictly historical context the author makes sure to point out how each of the individuals that had been involved in the various hoaxes - unwittingly or not - was either 1) a Snidely Whiplash-esque villain, twisting his or her mustache as the marks fell for the con, or 2) a grade a moron.In theory it wouldn't be a bad primer for this sort of thing, but you could easily glean more information from Wikipedia about each of the cases in question."
positive,"Restored and remastered: Finally they have fixed the Transformers m,ovie and re-released it in the original opening night format. For those of you who were not at the opening, this movie caused a panick at the theatre beacause of the violence and profanity. By saturday night a new edited version of this movie came out to satisfy parents. Now almost 20 years later you can once again see it in its original complete form.Hopefully this DVD will usher in a new generation of Transformer DVDs from the original series to the new series in japan. All of these DVD's are excellent and have been restored so that even the most fussy of viewer will enjoy. ..."
positive,"enlightening and very practical book: This is a very hopeful and enlightening book as the various thoughts and stories help us to look at life in a more positive way, which can only improve quality of our lives. It made me realize to be aware of the world around me and to learn to appreciate things and people in our lives. We usually live our lives in such hustle and bustle that we overlook the many experiences and people that we face in our daily lives. In the stories of the common everyday people in the book, we realize that we are not alone, that there are factors beyond us which are involved and that we should be open to them and not overlook our experiences.This book is very easy to read and understand and each chapter stands by itself. You can open up any chapter at any time and with the thoughts and the connected stories of real people, you can find enlightenment.A wonderful book, full of hope and insight."
positive,"Love this book!: I could not put this book down! Since I read this book, I have purchased several other of Philippa Gregory's Tudor books, The Constant Princess, The Boleyn Inheritance and now The Queen's Fool. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history with a twist. Read it before the movie comes out in Feb.!"
positive,"Grisham,s always good: I believe John Grisham is truly one of America,s greatest writers , not only one of the most popular. He spoiled me with "" King of Torts"" , which I believe to be his best and one of the best books I,ve ever read. Bleachers followed and was excellent illustrating how we idolize coaches and team that are successful and overlooking that this same were not always hero,s to their children and friends. The Last Juror is an very good read bringing Grisham back to his boyhood Mississippi. There are a lot of little stories along with the main theme. This is almost the differance between just eating and dining. It,s Good."
negative,"Technical Analysis of stock trends is a tiring book.: BORING. I started to read about the Dow Theory with old fashioned charts of defunct stocks. There are supplements to the text to bring in modern stocks, but maybe one should retire this book."
negative,"Not as good as Harry Potter, says I: While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax. This book isn't as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion, and no one can refute me. Tastes are relative!"
positive,"GREAT!!! and slow cost!!! BUT!!: This product works great once you figure out how to connect it. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. The price is perfect for someone one on a budget. The instruction on the manual are not clear, i followed the instruction and was ruinning into problems when I tried to connect to my secured network. I had to go to the manufacturer website and download the most up to date driver and then use zero config when i right clicked on the icon on my desktop. I then let windowsXP detect the many wireless connection in my area. Once I clicked on my network and used my password this thing just work like magic. Connection, speed is awesome."
positive,"Almost as good as 'Deja Dead'... but still amazing!: If, like me, you have lived in Montreal (or maybe just visited), you will LOVE this novel - even more if you enjoy thrillers... A true page turner... Will Brennan ever have a fling with the French detective? Read to know. Again, you'll learn more about psychology and forensic anthropology than three years at the University.The reviewer, JR Geoffrion (JR@Geoffrion.com), earned his MBA from York University and completed the Wharton School Multi-National Marketing and Management Program. He also holds a Engineering degree from the University of Toronto."
positive,"Love it: I love this movie. It doesn't matter how many times I watch it, it's my favorite movie ever. Cher is wonderful, as is the entire cast."
negative,"Not necessarily a waste, but real close: I wasn't expecting a great movie from the likes of Madonna (although I do believe her to be a great performer on the music stage), but I did think I would get more than poor acting and crummy script. I was also surprised to see this type of work from the likes of Rupert Evert, but once Ben Bratt showed up and his performance was just as shaky, I realized that it was entire chemistry of the film. There was no continuity, and I swear there were times when it seemed Madonna was on the verge of tripping up her lines. Not to mention the fact that they had a child around 9 years old playing a character that was supposed to be 5 or 6. How stupid do they think the viewing audience is? I won't be recommending this to anyone."
negative,College Board doesn't endorse this book? What's up w. that?: I almost bought this book because I know a bunch of friends who are taking Kaplan and Princeton Review SAT prep courses. This is the first time I noticed that the college board doesn't endorse the Princeton Review's book. What does that mean? I'm not buying this book!
negative,"Price to quality ratio -> infinity: Wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer. It's amazing something as simple as a tp holder can be so messed up ( and cost so much.) You are stuck with a fixed width that MUST fit your paper roll like a glove or else bathroom comedy ensues as the roll keeps falling off. I guess the previous owner enjoyed ""high-end"" toilet paper and I should be purchasing toilet paper commensurate to my high end bathroom accessories. /eyeroll"
negative,"Unfunny: I saw this movie on a reccomendation from a friend. It was boring, predictable, and the jokes were just trite. Slapstick comedy in the worst way, and there was not an ounce of wit to the script whatsoever. It presented filler situations such as a drug trip, some crass old man in a wheelchair, etc...and tried to pass it off as humor.I expected a witty British comedy, but what you have is a poorly done American comedy disguised as a British comedy. Do not waste your time."
negative,"Not the real deal: We received our comforter, and it was not the dimensions advertised. We contacted the seller(Egyptian Cotton Factory Outlet Store) and the claimed manufacturer (Warm Things). The manufacturer responded quickly to tell us that this seller does not have access to their products. The seller has copied the language from the manufacturer's website and is selling fraudulent products in their name. If you care about the quality or dimensions of the comforter you're buying, don't buy from them."
negative,"SimpleTech SmartMedia is slower than other brands: I have three brands of SmartMedia cards: SimpleTech, Viking, and the Olympus card that came with my camera. I timed how long it took to copy the same 5MB file to each card. The result: the other cards took 32 seconds and the SimpleTech took 38 seconds. So, my results show that the SimpleTech is about 18% slower than the others. That's important to me because when I take action shots I'm often waiting for the previous image to write to disk before I can take the next shot."
negative,"Incomplete and not thourough: This book is very, very superficial. Only a small part of the configuration of Tomcat is covered. Plus, it is certainly outdated today."
positive,FIVE STAR CD!: I LOVE THIS CD. A VERY REFRESHING AND UNIQUE SOUND FROM THE NEWEST SUPERSTAR IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY!
negative,Perfect if I Lived In Europe: Received DVD's with no issue. The problem was that they were formatted for a region other than the United States. This is strange to be due to the fact that they were shipped from an American address to an American address. Amazon refunded my money with no issue.
positive,EXCELLENT!: These are very good & super fresh. Highly recommended for any & all nut lovers. The salty & sweet plus the perfect crunch make these hard to beat.
positive,One of the best books ever: I'm just going to say this is the second best book I have ever read (Lord of The Rings being the best). And he who says otherwise should be smacked in the face.
positive,"WOW! If you like country, you'll like this one.: Not much else to say. Every song on this CD is just great. Great classic country music from the late 50's."
positive,"Easy to understand advice about diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a national epidemic. Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are necessary to prevent complications (heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, blindness) in those with Type 2 diabetes and prevent the disease from occurring in those at high risk. Medical advice regarding diet often leaves patients confused and therefore unable to follow their advice. Kristine Napier defines Type II diabetes and the steps needed to control this disease in a way that is easy to understand. She provides advice and examples to help the reader incorporate her guidelines into their everyday life. Her 28 day guide of menus will help those get started and as always, Kris's recipes are easy to follow and delicious. Last, but not least of importance, is that all of Kris's advice is based on scientific evidence and conforms to national guidelines."
positive,"LIFE ROCKER: Had this one on vinyl back then. These girls know what rock and roll is! This IS HEART at their best [in the 80's].Not only the 5 singles on this album make it awesome but, the other songs are very good! I can tell by other critics that they must expect perfection consistently. Well man, it's ROCK AND ROLL and it's ""HEART"". Just one of the best in the business! They need NO critics! My opinion is that this album ROCKS! It's one of the girls best. LOVE YA GIRLS!ROCK ON! P.S. CAN'T GO WRONG HERE."
negative,"A complete waste of time: I'd give this thing zero stars if I could....it's just that bad.Don't get me wrong--I enjoy a ""stupid"" comedy as much as the next person. Hell, I enjoyed American Pie enough to pick it up on DVD. But it's really stretching the bounds of the word stupid and comedy to label this as a stupid comedy. It's just plain bad. Most of the amusing stuff is in the trailer and even there it wasn't that amusing. And there are lots of jokes in this film that if I told you about them, they would sound humorous and like you might get a chuckle out of them. You'd be completely wrong. I didn't see Battlefield Earth, so I can't say unconditioanlly this is the worst film of the year 2000. I can say that it's one of the worst films I've seen in a long time.Do yourself a favor--skip this. Don't waste the money or your valuable time on this turkey."
negative,"didactic and dull: I have liked older Nanci Griffith a great deal. This is not those albums. I also have great affection for the protest singers of the 60s and 70s, but this is not that, either. Gee, war is bad, Nanc? Thanks for pointing that out. The lyrics on this one have all the profundity of a slightly slow 12 year old. As someone with degrees in English and Women's Studies, I was insulted by ""Back When Ted Loved Sylvia."" The track where Nanci tries scat-singing sounds like she is being poked with a sharp stick. Throughout, I was very surprised someone on the staff producing this did not point out that changing your vocal timbre and volume drastically in the space of three notes is jarring and unpleasant. Very very unimpressive."
negative,"REALLY WIERD!: I thought this book was the strangest I've ever read regarding screenwriting. Screenwriting and spirituality may or may not mix, but spirituality really has nothing to do with writing a good screenplay! I have to agree with the previous reviewer who gave the book one star and say that I, too, found little practical advice in this book and the premise is even stranger. Why 21 days? Why does the author suggest that we whip out a screenplay in only 21 days? Isn't quality better than speed. I recommend Syd Field and Lajos Egri instead. Both are real pros and their books offer much detail and useful advice."
positive,Little Critters: All of these books that I have ordered are excellant. My grandaughter has me read them at least three times a day. We are both very happy w/ them.
positive,"A Truly Great Film , But...: I adore this movie...LOVE it... easily one of the Greatest World War 2 movies ever. Full of great actors and memorable scenes..my favorite being Red Skelton as the unlucky Para caught by his parachute on the church steeple, helplessly watching as all his buddies get picked off...an awesome scene. My only gripe about this movie is the lack of recognition of all the Canadians who played such a significant part in D-Day, especially on Juno Beach. Bizarrely, the Free-French forces get their own sub-plot in the movie...but where the bloody hell were the Candians in this otherwise fantastic film?"
negative,"Amazon video streaming does not work: Tried Amazon's video streaming for the first time for Transformers via the TV, but sadly it did not work. We have watched many movies from Netflix so surprised when this did not work especially after paying $3.99. Looks like I need to go back to DVD rentals for new releases at the blockbuster kiosk."
negative,"Michael Bolton Jr: WOW, this album is horrible!!! How can anyone with a fully functional brain buy this nonsense!!! This is contrived tripe targeted to people who don't know any better. I can't believe this type of CRAP is what people call music these days. This is safe, middle of the road JUNK! Music is going downhill and it's because CRAP like this is what sells these days. Whatever happened to taking risks in music? Not just pandering to people who are afraid of listening to music that actually challenges and provokes thought.Stop being braindead drones america and reject this manufactured sewage that american radio and record companies are trying to pass off as music. Awful just awful.......*gags*"
positive,"Superb and useful book: A thorough and useful book. Shows practical ways and guidelines/checklists to evaluate whether the school is teaching your kids, or wasting their time. While the book concentrates on helping your kids take advantage of (or survive!) public schools and other schools, there is also a lot of fascinating info showing how the schools have degenerated and why.One of the most useful parts of the book is factual and practical advice about dealing with schools and problem teachers. For example, what to do if your kid is assigned to a useless stupid and incompetent teacher. A situation which, in these days of affirmative action and ""dumbing down,"" occurs far too often."
positive,"great buy...: good price, fast shipping! what more could you want? it serves it's purpose for simple around the house/shop measurements."
negative,"Received wrong Item: Dear Amazon;I placed this order pictured above; Cobra HG S300 and I received a Cobra S300 instead. I have been greatly to all lengths dissappointed in the handling of this situation. I requested for UPS to come to my house (call tag) to pick this wrong item up and did not get any results from it. Therefore, I Will No longer place another order from ya'll again. If I had received the correct order, I probably would have been a satisfied customer, but like I said, I am greatly dissappointed and would not recommend ordering from amazon. SORRY!!!!"
positive,"Exactly What I Wanted: I looked at all the different types of body/pregnancy pillows on Amazon and finally settled on this one. I am pregnant and have recently gotten to the point that I just cannot get comfortable in bed. I have had this pillow a week now and I absolutely love it. It was worth every penny. It's like sleeping in a nest, it supports me beautifully and its very comfortable."
negative,"very poorly mastered off the vinyl: I'm not categorically against mastering cd's off the vinyl. I understand sometime it's the only option available; however, I have a hard time believing this is the best they could do. Plenty of hiss and crackle and the muffled sound found on vinyl that was poorly pressed in the first place. If you have acess to a vinyl copy, save your money."
negative,"Not Inclusive; doesn't give over all picture of US HORSE CAVALRY: MY LATE FATHER WAS A MEDICAL DOCTOR IN THE 9TH CAVALRY REGIMENT, SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION. THERE WASN'T MUCH SAID ABOUT THE 2ND CAVALRY DIVISION. PERHAPS COLONELTRUSCOTT DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE 2ND CAV DIVISION WAS THE LAST HORSE CAVALRY IN THE US ARMY. THEY WERE PROUD MEN WHO REALIZED THAT THEY WERE THE LAST LINK TO THE WILD WEST. BRACKETTVILLE AND FORT CLARK WERE A REMOTE POST AND LOCATION. MY FATHER LEARNED TO RIDE A HORSE AT FORT CLARK. THE MEN HAD FUN IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE 2ND CAV DIV NEVER SAW COMBAT; LET ME CORRECT THIS...ELEMENTS OF THE 2ND CAVALRY DIVISION FERRIED MEN AND EQUIPMENT IN BURMA AND CHINA VIA HORSE AND MULE. THEY DID FIGHT THE JAPANESE. GIVE THESE PROUD MEN THE CREDIT THEY ARE LONG OVERDUE TO GET."
positive,"not typical gary paulsen material: This book is quite a change from all of the other Paulsen books, although it retains Paulsen's usual underlying theme of survival in the wilderness. Yup. And I'm afraid that several of the other reviewers were misguided or perhaps confused, as the book is not overflowing with ""goar""; nor was the main character-Mark-on Mars. I found this novel captivating and entertaining. I enjoyed Mark's attitude that he aquired on Transall, which is the name of the world Mark is mysteriously transported to after falling into a bizzare blue light. This book has a satisfying ending and leaves the reader both awestruck and contemplative."
positive,"Very Different From Jaffe's Usual: The first story is a novella, the tale basically of a Holly Golightly type named Melba Toast who uses men for their money, and her female friend and admirer who is not sure she can or wants to become like Melba. This story and the rest of the short ones are quite different from the ones of Jaffe's usual innocent, naive heroine who has limited insight to her own behavior. The tone is more real, the women are more realistic, and the stories are just more well-written overall. I would recommend this book over any other Jaffe book."
positive,"Unmatched: I read this book years ago when it was newly published. I passed it around from friend to friend until my copy disappeared. I consider it the best psychological thriller of all. Thanks,Amazon"
positive,"One of the more original albums I have ever heard: I bought this with the intention of being slighlty dissappointed since AP made the incredibly bold statement of saying that they are the last ""great"" pop band of the millenium. There is no denying the fact that the way I heard music was completely revolutionized even with the first listen of The Three E.P's. The patience, imagination, and originality shown in this collection of tunes is not given true justice with my petty description. Buy this if you want to be blown away by the capabilities of music. This is the coolest thing I have heard since DJ Shadow's Entroducing. Saying that these four guys are the real deal is a drastic understatement."
negative,"guy movie!: If a guy made this kine of film, people will say he is a porn star. What it wrong with that female actress? Does she have a low selfasteem or what? Maybe she is desperate for money."
positive,"best blades ever!!!!: The Gillette fusion has been the best blades ever. Now, I found this 12 blades for less. Great deal at the best price. Thanks AMAZON for these deals."
positive,"A fantastic read!: I got this book for Christmas, I wanted it to read more about the Boleyns and King Henry after seeing the movie, 'The Other Boleyn Girl, which I loved. I was NOT disappointed! It is SO well written and you just completely lose yourself into the life of Mary Boleyn, her family, and the King Henry. I could hardly put this book down. It's fascinating how the lives of ladies in the court were in those times."
negative,"Repulsive: My class had to watch this movie, and half of us think it's disgusting while the other half thought it was a masterpiece. Well, personally, I thought it was repulsive. The violence and nudity were nothing less than shocking. I'm not blaming Kubrick, it's just how the story goes. After watching 30 minutes of it, I had to turn off the TV."
positive,Brilliant!: Alexandre Dumas's classic novel The Count of Monte Cristo is an absolutely brilliant book. Dumas's genius shows as he intertwines characters and twists and turns through out the entire book. Definetly the best book ever!
negative,"Unclear, hazy music track..like old phonograph!: my disc is in perfect condtion but the music sounds slightly scratchy or like you put cellophane in your ears before you listened...very odd"
positive,Great book: Had read Lord of the Rings before movies came out but had never read The Hobbit. Enjoyed this as much or more.
negative,"Not only terrible, but DANGEROUS!: A friend of mine gave the ""Sammy and Sharon Safety"" product to my son as a gift. My son tried to open it, but struggled mightily with the packaging. After a few frustrating minutes, I took it away from him and tried to open it myself. It was amazingly difficult, espcially considering the age group that this product is intended for. What was even more disturbing was that in my own frustration to open the box, I cut my finger open on the plastic! Thank goodness it wasn't my son's finger! If it wasn't so disturbing I would have laughed at the irony that I was injured by a toy supposedly promoting safety.All of this preceded our discovery that the product as a whole is quite poorly made (the outfit is already falling apart). In addition, it seems that the author of the book is so concerned with rhyming that he ignores basic principles of grammar and sentence structure. Children's books should not seem as if they were written BY children."
positive,"Simplt the finest epic fiction ever crafted.: The Hobbit is the introduction to the brilliance of Tolkien and the wonderful world of Middle Earth. The development of Bilbo, and his supporting cast, draw the reader into their lives and adventures like no other fantasy ever written. With the addition of the Lord of the Rings, often mistakenly listed as a trilogy (it was originally written as one book with three parts), the world of Middle Earth continues to evolve and grow, and fall into greater turmoil. Tolkien creates characters and societies with real prejudices, fears, mistrust, and needs that the perceptive reader can readily identify with and understand. If I was to own but two works of fiction, the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings would comprise my collection."
positive,"the BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This movie is totally hilarious! It may be one heck of a movie, but I could easily compare it to classics such as Gone with The Wind. Seann William Scott is a genius! Everybody I know who's seen it gets a ton of laughs out of it. If you like movies such as Strange Brew, Bill & Teds Bogus Adventure, Scary Movie, and Half-Baked then this be da movie for ya'll!!!!!!!!!!!"
negative,"Faulty Product - Horrible Support: I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened. No power- nothing.When I unplugged this adapter the negative metal ring from the plug stayed lodged inside of my computer, I had to remove it with needle nose pliers.I had to call the company 5 times before getting a rep on the phone as I was continually placed in automated limbo for about 15 per call. The rep actually admitted to me that this happens alot because the rings are too small and fit to tight in the computers.I was really looking forward to saving some dough. But this adapter was surprisingly worse the the original that came with the computer.They are sending me return authorization."
negative,"Lack of Scholarship: If it weren't for the misinformation and outright lies, I wonder if there would be anything left to this book. Boettner's depiction of Catholism and Catholics doesn't square with the practice or history of the Catholic faith. Go elsewhere for useful information. 1 star is too many in this case."
positive,Cannery Row Review: I think that the book Cannery Row is a decent book. Its not the best book that i have ever read but it is a good one. Cannery Row has a layed back kind of plot and the characters were very suspenseful. everything that happened could be foreshadowed. Doc was my favorite character. I liked him best because he was very layed back and was nice to everyone. He was always there when you needed a hand. I like how Steinbeck made the character Mack. Mack isnts the smartest guy butI believe that his morals were right. I like how Mack and the boys live life day by day and just try to have fun and not worry about anything. I think that this was an all around good book.
negative,Fahrenheit 451: I first read this book in my L.A. class at school. This book has many meanings tied into it. Fahrenheit 451 is different then what I usally read. This book has so many hidden detals in it. In this book I can acutally see our world now ending up like the world in this book. The author of this book was brillant to make up a world like this. The main character Montag was great I could realt to him and put myself in his shoes that's what I like so much about this book. If I didn't read this book in class I probably would never read it.Hi Ms. O!!!!
positive,"A comfortable prison is still a prison.: Where George Orwell's 1984 was an attack on Stalinism, We is an attack on Leninism. This makes it particularly uncomfortable to Communist apologists who like to blame the brutality of the Soviet Union on Stalin, while freeing Lenin of any respondsibility. Zamyatin contradicts any such whitewash; the ""Welldoer"" (Lenin), is still just a dictator. A prison, even a comfortable one, is still a prison. Individuality Zamyatin argues, is too high a price to pay for security. The writing is excellent, the story is timeless, and the novel is a triumph of both Science Fiction and political satire. This is the book that made ""liquidation"" a euphemism for murder"
negative,"Only a true fan can finish this book: This book is NOT one of S.K.'s best. He is still a master writer, however the flashbacks every five pages got a little annoying. As always the characters lept off the page, but the plot is left seriously wanting. Don't read this book unless you have major patience and time to kill."
negative,"Formatting is wrong: Someone at Amazon needs to fix the left-hand margin... the left margin is wider than the right, and it drives me nuts! It shouldn't be that hard.This seems to happen a lot with the free classics from Project Gutenberg."
negative,"Not very good: We own every European travel book that exists. I can honestly say that this one is by far the worst one I have seen, hands down. The coverage of accommodations is sparse and only includes extraordinarily expensive hotels, for the most part, and the dining recommendations are little better. There are no unique tips in this guide and it really covers 6 cities, and not very comprehensively. I give an extra star for making the attempt to write a kids travel guide, since they are not common."
positive,"HOLLYWWOD ""BAD BOYS"": The Bad Boys of Hollywood as you have never seen them before.This special breed lit up the screen with blockbuster films and their private lives did not pale in comparison.A gossip gourmets delight!Newly discover footage that will spotlight these lovable rogues as they lived out our fantasies.Marlon, Brando, Errol Flynn, Robert Mitchum, Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson, James Dean, Sean Penn, Steve McQueen, John Bulusi are all here!"
positive,"An in-depth look into this subject: Even if you don't agree with Chick's religious outlook (or his way of promoting it) this is an excellent sourcebook for the study of his tracts, booklets which it seems we have all seen at one time or another. These tracts take on Mormons, Catholics, homosexuals, Muslims, liberals, Satanists... you name it! This books provides ""reviews"" of the tracts, some example illustrations, talks about variations in various booklets, some of which have been in print for 40 years. Whether your a fan of Chick's views or are just interested in this medium this is an excellent book."
positive,"Really great customer service.: There were post office issues with the delivery of my product. I sent an e-mail to Amazon letting them know, and they had a replacement on my doorstep the next day. Really great customer service."
positive,"Great old-timer: Always loved this movie, found out my hubby liked it, too. So, I ordered it as a suprise, sat the hubs down with some munchies and we had a ball watching John Wayne at his best: the blustery know it all and the charmer with the twinkle in his eye. This one makes the guys and ladies happy!"
negative,How can you give this tripe 5 stars?: Anyone who gets to stay up later than 9 PM would recognize that this book stinks. This kid isn't any worse than some of the other fantasy pulp-mysters out there but he's not worthy of anything approaching a good review. Gonna' be on a desert island for a few months? I'd rather read the palm leaves....
positive,"Casualties Mount: Literally taken place the evening after the first War Games, War Games: Tides is the continued story of the battle facing Batman and his allies in the face of gang reprisals following the death of many of the city's key underworld leaders.War Games: Tides provides an answer to who is responsible for that fateful meeting, and has fatal consequences for one of Batman's allies as others try to gain advantage in the ensuing chaos. It also highlights Batman's weakness of playing his cards too close to his chest and underestimating the ramifications of his plans in the hands of others."
positive,"Good Value Optical Mouse: I purchased this mouse to replace the normal track-ball mouse that came with my computer. The operating system automatically detected the mouse right away, and I did not have to do any further setup/installation/configuration. Scroll wheel support was automatically set, and I have no problems using it with my enhanced keyboard. A great buy to replace your current mouse!"
negative,"Unusable after two days.: I picked these up for 4 dollars at a local home improvement store. These gloves stood out for their comfort-- they fit very well, and provided a better range of movement than the other available cowhide gloves-- and for their price.For the past two days I have been moving heavy logs, splitting, and stacking them. Yesterday I put on a brand new pair of these gloves, and when I was done today, there were three very large rips around the thumb of the right (dominant) glove, and one large tear on the pinkie of the other glove. They were damaged to the point that they no longer provided the protection I needed for my work.I would have given these gloves 5 stars for comfort, but gloves simply need to last longer than two days. For now I will use my old gloves (thinner, less confortable) that have been put through the same kind of work for the past three years without any tears."
negative,"Better off reading the book: I read the book twice before ever seeing the movie. I was disappointed. By the time the movie got going, it ended. I felt that there wasn't an increase in action and the climax was at the end, horribly directed movie. There were so many items left out of the movie that the book included, it made the movie worth less. who could forget about Benjamin's attitude, or Mollie and her sugar and ribbons. There simply wasn't the same affect on the watcher as the book had on the reader. The movie may not have been that long, but I sure wish I could get those 70 minutes back in my life."
positive,"NOT LIMP BIZKIT, RAGE: ok, i just heard of Quarashi the other day on MTV2. The first thing i thought was Beastie Boys. The second thing i thought was mixed with ""Rage against the Machine"". yes, that's right, this band sounds nothing like Limp Bizkit, it's painfully obvious to me that they sound like Rage and Beasties. With that, this band f---ing rocks. I swore to god that if i heard another rap-rock song i was going to riot. the thing abotu this band is they're not a nu-metal band. most of the rock-rap bands are nu-metal, which means they're depressing, dull, and boring. this band is anything but that. they've got the melodic/funk side of the beastie boys, and the hard rock side of rancid and rage. i'm not saying this is anything too original, cuz it's not, but this band can really pull off a Beastie Boys version 2.0 extremely well. I can't wait to get the actual CD, tho i hear the albums released in Iceland are more raw sounding, and not as produced. i wish i could get an import. oh well."
negative,"Runs large, fairly slow to ship: This shirt runs large. The color is not the same as what is depicted in the image here (look beige in the picture, but has a greenish cast in reality), otherwise the quality is alright.Also, having been spoiled by Amazon and Costco, more than a week (9 days), for an item to arrive seems a long wait."
positive,"Simply delightful!: This is a classic. A must read for children of all ages.If you like adventures filled with dragons and wizards, dwarves and little people then you'll love this story.I've read this book several times now and each time find something new in it.I can't recommend it enough."
positive,"Good pump for the price!: So far so good. Works better than any I have had from local Home Depot, PetSmart, etc.I use it to return water to top pond from bottom, and it works well."
positive,"One of my childhood faves!: I hadn't seen this movie in over 10 years, it used to play in our basic local channels when I was a kid, and I remember really liking it, being really afraid of the worm things, remembering mr. miyagi's death and thinking ""HOLY CRAP THEY JUST ATE MR. MIYAGI!"" lol. So when I saw it here for a really low price, I bought it, recently watched it, and loved it just as much as I did when I was a child. Definitely entertaining enough, Kevin Bacon is REALLY young in this, and you get to see Reba kicking some worm ass. The image quality in blu-ray is really good, considering this is a movie from the 80's."
positive,An extremely realistic and exciting scenario for WWIII: This is my favorite Clancy book. After a terrorist attack leaves the Soviet Union vulnerable they plan to take desperate action against the West and the wealthy nations of the Middle East.
negative,"Laptop May Fall Out: I bought this backpack a while ago, despite my reservations about having the opening for the laptop compartment on the side. The obvious danger is to forget closing the zipper, and it won't take much for your laptop to go flying ... Naturally I tried to be careful about closing it, but one day I must have been distracted or in a hurry, and when I took off the backpack, my laptop fell on the floor. Many other computer backpacks also have a strap that secures the laptop, and prevents it from moving around; this one doesn't. Otherwise it is quite nice and comfortable, but I won't use it for laptop duty anymore."
negative,"Moans: Ugh! This film was awful. Beyonce cannot act her way out of a wet paper back and her singing is marginal, at best. Jennifer Hudson has a huge voice, but the songs are so bellowy it has little to no effect. Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx were just ridiculous casting. Avoid this turkey."
positive,"star studded comedy: This is a very funny movie which parodies great detectives of literature and film. The ending is a bit convoluted so I gave the movie 4 stars. However, you will enjoy this movie and laugh at the characterizations by Peter Sellers as Sidney Wang (an hysterical take off on thc Charlie Chan character), Peter Falk as Sam Diamond (vs Sam Spade), Elsa Lanchester as Jessica Marbles (Marples), James Coca as Monsieur Perrier (Hercule Poirot) and David Niven and Maggie Smith as Dick and Dora Charleston (a nice take off on Powell/Loy duo Nick and Nora Charles). The dialogue is pure Neil Simon, quick and clever. A blind butler excellenty played by Sir Alec Guiness adds to the hilarity. Buy this film and you will not be sorry..."
negative,Sadly disappointing: I enjoyed the first two books in this series very much and was dissapointed by this installment. Diane Duane does not usually give easy answers to her moral dilemmas but in this story both the dilemma and the story were too easy and the story dragged down by the rather overtly gooey overtone.As a convicted Christian I find the idea that the 'lone power' ie satan can be redeemed repellent- this stuff is poisoning kid's minds. This sequel was obviously written to milk the orginal concepts and make a bit more money and I think I would admire Diane Duane infinitely more if she had stuck to her integrity as an author.
positive,Lotus Flower Purchase: Amazon makes it easy to find obscure releases from lesser known artists. The one-click shopping is easy to use. The item was shipped and received very quickly and arrived in perfect condition.
positive,portable speaker system: I like to take this and my mp3 out to the pool at night. Works great and easy to carry and set up. Plenty loud anywhere in the pool except underwater. Nice product.
negative,"Garbage: I think this album was a piece of garbage. She cannot sing,and she sounds like she's whining. She messed up alot of songs by trying to put them in her own words. Next time don't make any albums unless you have good music!"
negative,"WHO THREW THAT CHAIR ONTO THE SET?: I watched this when it came out, and have returned to it years later.And how different it seems in retrospect.The acting is wooden - it's as if someone threw a chair onto the set. There are some good performances but in the main the order of the day is clipped upper class Englishness with warmth and humanity drained away. All very sterile.The writing and dialogue is at times painful, stilted and unreal, with the delivery of lines from the actors forced and almost alien.Some other strange stuff too: the uncle liked little girls (in a sexual way)and this was shrugged off as mild eccentricity. How times have changed since the 1990s !What is good about this series is the historical references and the depiction and sense of the war years.Well worth watching but not the greatest piece of drama."
positive,"Having an electronic resume is a must in today's job market!: The content and technical how-to's are in this book! Writing, programming and posting a web resume can be a major challenge. Rebecca Smith is a great help if you take the time read and study her words. It will be worth it because being able to post and share your resume through a simple URL in an email is THE WAY TO MARKET YOURSELF ONLINE! I recommend this book highly! Kathryn K. Troutman, President, The Resume Place, Inc.; Author of four resume books and creator of web resumes!"
positive,"FORGET PAGE 144: I have read this book and it offers excellent advise for parents. Several reviewers here have pointed out the authors ""outdated"" views on homosexuality - this is their opinion. Homosexuality is definitely an identity crisis and professional help should most definitely be sought immediately. There should be no doubt that individuals with a gay or bisexual agenda wrote the careless and irresponsible comments above. On the whole, the book is excellent. If you don't agree with page 144 just tear it out and your done."
negative,"COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!: I simply cannot believe that I paid $30 bucks for this thing. It does absolutely NOTHING, except make a few electronic noises. I kept poring over the instructions, certain that I'd missed something......but I hadn't!! BORING. I think that even my 7-year-old son, who wanted this thing, was disappointed. And don't even talk about the batteries...to add insult to injury, this thing takes button cells, which aren't cheap. Save your $$ for something better.DYB"
positive,Satisified customer: Item shiped in a timely manner and arrived in the described condition. Would use this seller again.
negative,"Barely OK, moving toward don't buy: It worked fine for about 2 years, starting my Ford Ranger approximately 10-12 times, then just went south and wouldn't hold a charge. Same as some other reviewers here. For the money it is not a good value."
positive,"Pretty good!: It doesn't appear as though there are any scratches to the CD that I can tell. However, when I opened the case, I did notice that someone had thumbed it up quite a bit. There were fingerprints all over the top of the CD. But the bottom looks to be alright. I'm taking it to a friend in a shop downtown next time I go to put the CD through their buffer machine just incase, but really I think it's fine. :)The movie came in it's original casing. I'm pretty excited to own it!"
negative,"Too weird: I guess I expected humor. Instead, it was a downer. I made it thru about a third of the book and gave up."
negative,"The East Side Kids get into horseracing.: Well, the East Side Boys finally made it out of the haunted mansion inEast Side Kids - Boys of the City(1940). They are suppose to be painting a wall in town, but Leo Gorcey has decided he wants to be a jockey. Knuckles (Dave O'Brien) and Algy (Eugene Francis) must keep an eye on this gang to make sure they finish the job. They made a mess of it, so Knuckles told them to go hide at there old stable hang-out. The boys decide to race a throughbred they own called, Blue Knight. If Seabiscuit could win and make money for everyone, so could Blue Knight. After all, the horse is from Kentucky. Guess who they train to be the stable jockey? Muggs. The boys are: Bobby Jordan, Leo Gorcey, Sunshine Sammy Morrison, David Gorcey (Leo's younger brother) and Donald Haines. The next films are:Pride of the Bowery (1941)(1941), FLYING WILD (1941), BOWERY BLITZKRIEG (1941)."
positive,"Noir to its very bones: The Bottom Line:A ""skid row"" production, Detour is an incredibly minimalist picture that manages to do a lot with very little and emerges as a interestingly-hard edged psychological thriller of a noir; the Hays Code-enforced ending detracts a little from the spirit of the film, but Detour is a diversion worth taking.3.5/4"
negative,"HORRIBLE customer support: Like everyone else, I had the paper feed problem. However, what's really awful is the customer support. I service rep in India took the call, and while I knew exactly what the problem was, it was like talking to a robot. All the rep could do was follow exactly what his script said, then he transferred me to someone else who asked the same exact questions all over again.HP was so gung-ho about offshoring all of their customer service. Well, since I can no longer GET any competent service I certainly won't be an HP customer again."
negative,"Nothing good: I can't find anything good to say about this movie. The acting is poor; the plot seems to have a mind of its own (like a 2-year-old's); the fighting scenes are some of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. They're so unrealistic, it's more like watching a cartoon. Dennis Rodman does seem to try, sometimes. Most of the time, he's just trying, unsucessfully, to be cool. Half of the characters in this thing seem to be there for comic relief. Seriously, half of them. It's that stupid. Don't pay money to see this movie. And don't EVEN consider buying it."
positive,"A 1970s gem: As other reviewers have righly asked, how was this not a big seller upon its release? So many good songs, sung so well. I never tire of listening to this one."
negative,"Holy dear God: Where to start? How about this. Just as annoying as the super agent who knows everything. Always has the right tools to get the job done & full of witty remarks comes a story at the opposite end of the spectrum. Another attempt at the bumbling-idiot-that-just-so-happens-to-save-the-day cliche. Full of things that go fast, extreme sports refrences, & cheesy over-the-top male bravado. This attempt tries to capitalize on pop culture in every way. Without attacking a particular class of people, let's just say that this will appeal to those that don't mind shallow and mindless action movies. Everything goes boom and the day is saved. Oh yah. Now that's entertainment."
negative,"sizing + rough + made in china = meh.: Odd sizing: I ordered a size too large based on other reviews, and they fell off my feet. I returned them for my usual size, and my toes bump the tips. Well, they're leather, they should slop out with wear. The sole is also disproportionately narrow.Rough shearling: nothing really horrible, but enough to be irritating over a long evening's wear.""Representing the finest in America's Slipper Tradition"" (That's what it says right on the box): my eye, they're made in China!Bottom line: my feet are warm, but these aren't worth the cost, especially when environmental factors are included. When they wear out, I'll be looking for local + quality to replace."
negative,"Not woryh a plug nickle: Useless, just a junk kit. Do not waste ur time or pennies on this item. If it was free and I had to checkin to sign up to get it, I would refuse it! Junk!"
negative,"Super Saver Shipping not available: The item indicates free shipping but when you try to check out, that option is not available and attempts to charge 55 dollars (Alaska).So don't use one click checkout unless you don't mind paying shipping."
negative,"One star for the Movie, None for the DVD: As other reviewers have noted, this is a ground-breaking, hilarious, one-of-a-kind movie. It deserves to be in everyone's DVD collection, even if your collection consists of but two DVDs. It deserves five, even six, stars, but...I urge you to wait for another DVD version, for two reasons: first, if ever a film deserved extras, it's WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, but we get none on this over-priced DVD. Second, the movie is trimmed by a scant few seconds (on grounds of poor taste in the offending scenes), but the critical thing is -- It IS censored. Strike a small blow for the ability to decide for yourself, and avoid this DVD. Wait -- it'll show up in an unadulterated version at some point in the near future."
negative,"Lite-Flite Net not Screen: I only received the net, not the screen. The seller said that Amazon made a mistake and that the listing was only for the replacement net. I returned it because I needed the entire screen. Customer service was fair at best. Shipping was slow because it was drop-shipped from Jugs."
positive,"Get it: The matches rock, no doubt about it. I have seen them live and they are my favorite local band ever. I saw them a little more than a year ago for the first time and I called a few friends and told them that this band weas going to be huge someday. At the time I copmpared them to sum 41 and said they were even better than them and to look out for them. Well check it out, here they are on epitaph and i am so proud of them. Only problem is, superman is not on this cd and it is one of my favorites and the fave of many others. that is too bad. all in all, be sure to grab this cd. you will really like it."
positive,"love this movie!: This is a great movie with an excellent cast and a beautiful score. I watch it over and over! Some of the scenes are a little bit gruesome, but they are somewhat necessary for the story."
negative,Worse vacuum: I would give this vacuum zero stars if I could. I just spent 30 minutes to get the 5 screws out to change the belt that broke after only 2weeks of use. I'm frustrated with grease all over my hands from changing the belt.I returned my first one because the belt broke several times in a short period of time. I stupidly brought a second (thought the first was a lemon); I will be returning this one as well.
negative,"Bill James it ain't: No doubt the worst of the many attempts to cop the ideas and success of Bill James, Pete Palmer, etc. over the past decade. Cute names and sophomoric humor aside, there isn't a great deal of meaningful analysis here, and if you take the time to go back and look at the previous year's addition, you will see that these guys are wrong a lot more often than they are correct. Their arcane formulas and measurements totally miss the point of something as simple and palatable as Runs Created, and the result is a dull and confusing mass of EqA's."
negative,"Historical accuracy cannot overcome this poor novel.: Although it is interesting to read about the historical background of the figures in the Easter rising, the contrived plot and relationships are outrageous. It's bad enough that the news media loves to publish every story about wayward priests, but please spare my having to read about it from an Irish author. Then the choice between the snooty girl and the prostitute just kills me. I would have expected much better than this. Trinity by Uris is far more realistic."
negative,"DON'T SEE THIS ONE!: This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I love movies like Dumb and Dumber, Road Trip, and Me, Myself, and Irene, but this movie made those three look like Academy Award Winners. It was just horrible, please do not go waste your time. The plot was horrible and I wish I hadn't spent the $4.36 to rent the DVD. I would have given this far lower than one star, but that is the lowest."
negative,"There's a reason this movie is out of print: This has to be one of the stupidest things I have ever seen. The plot makes little sense, the acting is terrible, and it tries to rip off aspects of real ""horror"" movies (such as Amityville Horror's ""Get Out"" and Halloween's music)."
positive,"So far so good: The book is very informational. At the very least it helps you ""connect"" more with the sport, at the best it makes it easier to do and easier on your body."
negative,"Wow, what a horrible tent...: We took this tent to the beach to camp for the weekend. After taking it out of the box (brand new) and getting the supports hammered in, the corner snapped completely off (cheap sewing job). Then we tried rigging it in place and that helped but the wind (10mph at most) kept imploding the tent and snapping more fabric in the process.Another important note is the window and door zippers get caught into the mesh and rip...we payed 100+ dollars for this tent and we want every penny of it back.Overall, do not buy this tent unless you're planning on putting it in the backyard for your kids. It just doesn't hold up. I would have given it zero stars but one will have to do."
positive,Classic Dickens: One who enjoys Charles Dickens will love this recording. The voices selected to read the story put the spirit of the author into the work. These talented readers take one into the heart of the story. An excellent rendition of a timeless classic.
negative,Hard to Program: This product has the most difficult programming instructions I have ever seen. Even changing the clock time (which you have to do 2X per year) proves to be a major challenge requiring the manual. The manual also must have been translated from Chinese as it is also difficult to understand...even for someone like myself with a technical degree! I tossed the product out after 6 months.
positive,"More than just bullfighting: Death in the Afternoon marks Hemingway's first major experiment in style and genre. While it is about bullfighting, and a marvelous one at that, this book is equally (and perhaps more importantly) about the art of writing as well as the writer himself, or more specifically Hemingway. When viewed in this context Death in the Afternoon reaches a much more complex structure and one demanding closer attention."
negative,Overkill: Yippie Another Covers Album From Shaw. Good Thing Nugent Didn't Lose The Damn Yankees Name To Him Or That Is What This Would Be Called.
positive,Other Peoples Money: Love this movie. Saw the play a number of years ago and I still would run off with DeVito. Came fast and in good shape
negative,"Not what you expect: I went into buying this eight DVD box set believing that there would be at least a few classic ""Stooges"" shorts. Instead, I receive only ONE DVD of shorts, the rest of the set being comprised of various clips, biographies, and rare footage of the Howard brothers. I'm all for learning a bit about our classic comedy heritage here, but my main complaint is that the clips on each DVD borrow greatly from each other (you'll find yourself watching one DVD, realizing you've seen these clips on the LAST DVD!), the clips are poorly edited together, and there are far too many annoying ""Pop-up Video""-esque factoids that are indeed informative, but get in the way of enjoying the Stooges' comedy.If you're interested in learning about the team here, read a biography. If you want to actually WATCH the Stooges, try a different box set."
negative,"Taylor Made Gazebo: When trying to install the products attachment brackets to the boat railing three of the eight screws supplied sheared off. When attempting to attach the cover over the frame, I discovered one of the velcro pieces sewn into the cover was coming unraveled. The center support pole that installs across the top and runs from front to back is supposed to have a pocket for the pole to fit into sewn into the cover at each end; mine only had one pocket making the center support useless. Got in touch with Taylor Made customer service to resolve the issue. They arranged for pick up of the defective product and said a new one would be sent right out to replace it....... over three weeks later and I still haven't received it. I think it will serve its purpose once I ever get the darn thing and it's not defective !"
negative,"Disappointed: I got two of these panties after reading other reviews. Yes, they are indeed nice and comfortable. However, the trims on the panties came off in several places after the first wash. It is ridiculous to pay $16 for THIS kind of quality. I am very disappointed!"
negative,"Listen to the samples before you buy: Okay, I made a HUGE mistake. I was at Best Buy (no on-line reviews...) and bought this CD based on the song list. Listen to the samples before you buy, you'll be convinced that YOU TOO, can be a ROCK STAR. I wouldn't buy an album that had me singing on it, but Kurt sounds weirdly like my own crooning in the first track. OOO, OWWW, MAKE HIM STOP...."
positive,Would buy it again.: It's taken a beatin and keeps on tickin. Was a pretty good price for the quality as well. Highly recommend
positive,"Artwork for the G.I. Joe Generation (and lovin' it.): McFarlane keeps things consistant. The amazing detail that McFarlane & Co. put into each one of their action figures is simply astonishing. From grass stains to the wrinkles in a players uniform. It's almost a 3-D slice of history. I feel bad for other companies that produce items such as this. Some of them these days are so articulated now. It's almost painful to look at them. McFarlane produces pieces that are not meant to move (at least not much.) The companies pieces are meant to look at. Perhaps bring back some very good memories of a moment in time. Maybe someday I'll have the chance to show this to my son and say ""I watched this man play."" The one great thing about these figures is that they are not anonymous people (except SPAWN himself.) They are our sports heroes."
negative,"Wow, What a Disappointment: It's really difficult to make a good movie with bad material. But making a bad movie with good material must be easy---Jan DeBont proves it with this turkey. Shirley Jackson's story was a spooky classic. Robert Wise's B & W version was excellent and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. And HE did it without special effects; just sound, shadows, and camera angles. This movie could have been so much better by relying on the original premise and forgetting all the comic book special effects. Mr. DeBont is proving that he's better as a technician than a director. Liam Neeson must have lost a bet to go along with this."
positive,"QUIRKY, ENERGETIC, BLAZING PULSE-POUNDER: To the beat of an incessant techno/deephouse soundtrack, Lola runs, and then runs some more. I couldn't possibly think of another movie with such sheer cinematic buzz, it's cut like an MTV video: blink and you may miss a visual gag.The theme is doozy but interesting -- a slicing of the same reality in time into three perspectives. Blending an innovative mix of animation, still photography, slow motion, and normal cinematography, it illustrates how the smallest change in what a person does can alter the rest of their life, not to mention the lives of others, including complete strangers they pass on the street.Ironic, creative, and simply riveting -- a fabulous kinetic pleasure of a rental. The breathless high-octane soundtrack should be in your dance collections too."
negative,"They don't have the Caterpillar-Flex: I just received the pampers baby-dry diapers in 2007-04-30, but guess what? The exp. date is 2006-12-31, as the other reviewer said, it's old type, they don't have the Caterpillar-Flex. I should send them back, but I don't have time and my baby needs diapers now. I'm very disapointed. They should check before they deliver."
negative,"Weak and error-ridden: Needs a factcheker and a good shot of adrenaline before it can hold a candle to ""Inside Oscar,"" ""Oscar A to Z"" or ""The Encyclopedia of Movie Awards,"" all of which include trivia tidbits to greater (and more accurate) effect than Jones' poorly written mishmash.Skip it."
negative,"dispointed: I was dispointed with the size of the creamer and sugar bowl. I was given another set(like this set) 3 years ago by my daughter for a birthday gift, she got it from the Betty Crocker web site. I was very please with it then as the bowl and creamer was a nice big size. as Betty Crocker no longer carries this line, I was pleased to find the set on Amazon.com. the picture was exactly like the set that I have.However This creamer and bowl that came with this set,looks like it was made for a child's tea set, they are so tiny, neither one holds a halve cup of sugar or creamer. And the Sugar Bowl is oval not round as it was on the online picture. I was very dispointed- as I had planed on giving it as a wedding present to a frend's daughter(who had liked the set each time I used it). I ended up buying something else for her. Now the Butter dish and Gravy Boat are normal size and thats makes them look even more tiny. I'll never buy this again"
positive,"Know what is happening inside you: Pregnancy can be a very long wait. This book helps a lot by giving you a month by month accounting of what is happening in the development of the baby, both in words and with awesome photos.Highly recommend for any new mom-to-be."
positive,"Pretty Funny: I <3 Alan Tudyk. Which was pretty much the only reason I bought the film, but it is genuinely good (for plenty of other reasons). Peter Dinklage is fantastic and I love that the whole film takes place over the course of an afternoon."
negative,"Leaky diaper...cheap - use Cruisers instead!: I decided to buy this over the cruisers since i'd save a few dollars and get a few extra diapers at the same time. Unfortunately, this diaper would fall apart in my hands as I opened it to put it on my son. In addition, my son would leak. So i decided to go back to the cruisers and have been happy since. No more leaky diapers."
positive,"Good Deal: Very pleased with EarGels & was surprised how fast they arrived. Certainly makes a big difference in being able to use my Jawbone, which would not stay in my ear with any of the factory supplied ear molds. Jawbone would do well to cut a deal with Jabra to furnish Ear Gels with all their Jawbones. Use it about 75% more now. Thanks for a good deal & fast shipping."
negative,"Families / Christians BEWARE: I rented this movie thinking it would be a sweet, romantic, relatively clean movie that I could enjoy watching. However, I was absolutely offended by some of the content of this film. In the first 15 minutes, you're introduced to a lesbian couple as they greet each other with a kiss on the mouth, and then announce that they're having a baby together. In the same scene, the main character uses the f--- word and it sounds like it was inserted into the script simply for the shock value. Also, there's teenage (and adult) premarital sex. Overall the film has a very casual attitude about sex and shows some rather graphic scenes for a PG-13 film. It's just another attempt by Hollywood to get us all comfortable with homosexuality, promiscuity, and a general idea of ""If it feels good, do it."" I would strongly advise against seeing this movie, especially with kids."
negative,"Borring no imagination: Skip this one, you'll fall asleep. Most of the stories are borring, even though there are a couple of exceptions."
negative,"The Shelters of Stone: After waiting 12 years for this book to come out ( I had given up hope) I was some what disapointed. I have come to expect Alya to be an independant and resoureful woman. It is as if she has just settled into the routine of daily life. Mostly the book covered what had been already written. Some of the pages were tedious and hard to keep up with. It took me about 3 days to read The Mammoth Hunters, I just couldn't stop reading. This one has left me with a bad taste. If I have to wait another 12 years to continue the saga I will be hard pressed to pay the price for the hard cover edition, and will wait till I can check it out or paperback."
negative,"Gary Busey's son, and OH LOOK! a giant robot Hitler!: I wasn't expecting much when I rented this DVD at Blockbuster, and I was right not to.It takes place in Antarctica, but none of the actors look like it is cold outside. CGI is ridiculously cheesy (typical of a SyFy movie), far too many closeups of the actors' faces on the outside shots (clearly an attempt to conceal the fact they are on a movie set) and SPOILER ALERT! the worst ""robot Hitler"" CGI you can imagine.Nothing that happened in this movie surprised me one bit, and it is clear to see why Dominique Swain's and Jake Busey's careers circled the drain at least a decade ago.The only reason why I gave this film TWO stars instead of ONE is because the premise of the film attracted me: Nazis trying to restart the Third Reich from (insert place here).It's good for a few mindless laughs. Other than that, don't waste your time."
positive,"3G: I work in china mobile Guangdong Branch, and I want to know the step to 3G,how can we progress to 3G ,It is good for me to understand the technical of 3G after reading this book."
positive,"the second best adam sandler film: this is a fantastic film i may be biased as i love adam sandler but believe me it really is!!!!! sum people dont like him cos he can b too stupid but in this film u have the odd bit of the typical adam sandler style but not much throughout the film, its like a cross between the wedding singer ( best film ever made) and groundhog day only really really funny drew and adam have a fantastic on screen chemistry that just makes them so believeable as a couple, n who could resist the charms of adam sandler. i would recommened this to all existing adam sandler & drew barrymore fans and those who think sandler is too stupid watch this and ull b pleasantly surprised."
negative,"not THAT funny: I didn't find this book particularly funny. It has its moments, sure, but the overall impression I got was ""outdated"": old jokes, every old Alaska cliche from sourdough to cheechako, *YAWN*, humor that may have been fresh once but is no longer. It's from 1997 and was not my first introduction to Alaskan writing. Maybe that's why. ;-)On a different note, I love Doogan's Nik Kane mysteries!"
negative,"Stay away! Warning!: I have bought this x3D gaming system in April 24 2005.I couldn't make it work at all: Not all CRT monitors are supported. Part of them requires a spacial power adapter, which the manual sais: ""Will be supplied (sent) free of charge"" upon request.I have called the company several times, and sent many emails.I even talked with someone called ""Ray Murph"" who promised me few times over the phone ""I'll get that in the mail to you shortly"". He didn't. They just ignored me.The company doesn't exist anymore. It changed its name to ""Technical Opticallity"" and moved to NY.Now it's June 2006 and I have no power adapter and no X3D gaming system to play. I have wasted my money. J&R; took no responsibility.Don't buy this stuff!!! Don't repeat the same mistake I have made!Eyal"
positive,"Better than some out there.: My one-year-old has played with this toy for several months. He disregards the keys and pulls up on the lids themselves. Not quite what I expected. He's had more fun pulling the lids up and pushing them down again, and only accidentally happens upon the moving keys and the noises they make. The sounds alternate between giggles with music background and animal noises, also not quite what I expected. But it's noise I can deal with. The volume can be adjusted or turned off (through I myself can't distinguish between ""soft"" and ""loud"" on this thing). My son enjoys the toy, but it may be of limited or intermittent interest."
negative,Little women: Very long and boring never read this book you will regret it with all your life trust me and my friends we all read this and we all hate it!!!!&
positive,A Must in any Library: Buy this in a hardcover edition--you won't be disappointed that you did! A solid and complex read time after time.
positive,"A great classic: This is an excellent classic love story. It is a little slow at times, but even worth re-reading. I would say more, but I read the book a long time ago."
positive,"Battle 360 season #1: I've enjoyed the whole season and my only complaint isn't so much with what it presents but rather what it doesn't present. We certainly made blunders and didn't have the battle experience of the Japanese in the beginning. The quality of our torpedo's left a lot to be desired.(The controversies of the war are not shown maybe they are right.) I wish it showed more, that generation was simply amazing far beyond our widest dreams but there was racism in their too all the foibles of man and despite it they ended it in a charitable way. I am in awe of that generation even knowing their humanity warts and all. Doug Johnson"
positive,"The Gadget: Near the end of world war 2, the scientist in Los Alamos,New Mexico, were working on a project called the atomic bomb. Stephen Orr is a thirteen year old boy living on a top secret military base with his father. Stephens father is one of the physicist building the bomb. Stephen tries to tell his father that building the bomb will kill inocent people.His dad doesnt listen. Stephens father still helps build the atomic bomb. Stephens father gets sick and later dies. Stephen and his friend stop the making of the atomic bomb and save the world from being destroyed."
negative,"Disappointed: To date I have still not received product I ordered and would like a refund immediately. I would have been cautious if I had read her previous reviews, apparently I am not the first person to purchase an item that they never receive. The money was taken from my account immediately but the shipment was never made. Amazon.com needs to review their sellers before people start looking at purchasing from other sources."
positive,"AMAZING DVD!!!!!: If you're a Flipper fan you must own this DVD!! - two gigs from the early day's - every song is great in it's own way - of course the band is messy but that's what makes Flipper so damn good! - my personal pic's have to be ""Shine"" and ""Life"" both with the late great Will Shatter on vocals. This DVD is 10/10"
positive,"Weak attempt: The Douglas Adams I remember from the first Dirk Gently novel is not present in this one. The storyline feels thrown together, the ending is forced, and the ability of the text to hold an audience is poor. Though there were a few bright spots, this book was a large disappointment. However, the Hitchhikers Guide five book trilogy and the first Dirk Gently novels are wonderful. Don't read this, it just disappoints. At best, it's a B-."
positive,"Frighteningly close to the truth: For a fascinating read, pick your favorite (yeah, right) business theory book about corporate culture and read it side-by-side with Orwell's masterpiece. The shifting truths, shameless propaganda and mindless work that drones like Winston Smith are subjected to illustrate the dark underside of corporate America that have resulted in the scandals of the early 21st centruy, including the likes of Enron, Tyco and others.Hell, if they served gin at work, the similarities would be complete for many workers.While Orwell is a pessimist, and sees nothing but a bottomless abyss, the careful reader can see glimmers of hope in the tired institutions of freedom of speech, and the press.Orwell's 1984 is as fascinating to read in the 21st century as it was when I read it for the first time in 1984."
positive,"Such Sweet Memories: Like others who were just as excited as I was to see this book on the shelf. My original copy was given to me by myAunt Virginia when I was 10 years old.(Back in 1963)As a child I drooled over the pictures and begged my mother to bake with me untill I was old enough to bake on my own. I wore out my first copy and was lucky enough to find a reprint in 1974, which I have been using up till now. My own girls were raised with that edition, they too always loved the pictures and would choose which ones they wanted to try. Many pages are loose and the cover is half off. While Christmas shopping I spotted the most recent reprint and was filled with fabulous memories. I asked for one for Christmas and there it was under the tree for me, just like almost 40 years ago. Today I'm ordering copies for my daughters and my neices."
positive,"Christmas Classic: What an amazing story. As an English teacher, the no holds barred story penned by Dickens is essential to remember not only during the holidays, but each day before and after. My students remember the Muppets and Mickey Mouse versions, and while they are pretty good for nostalgic purposes, this read really brings about the true message of living with Christmas in your heart. To some people this may seem like a ""dark"" book, but that was the purpose; to scare the readers into the realization that there are consequences for our actions."
negative,"Too Old: I bought the lipstick as mine had turned old and I wanted a fresh one (even though the color has been discontinued). The lipstick I received was the same quality of old as the one I already own. The lipsticks are old and should be thrown out! For $17, the vendor should not be selling."
positive,"Like taking a vacation: This DVD is a great choice for someone looking to get a peek at some of the best scenery in Alaska. These really make the cruises through Tracy Arm fjord sound so exciting and wonderful. It has great narration, gives you great footage of bears and other animals. The imagery of the glaciers and icebergs are absolutely amazing. Worth the buy, great to watch for a little at home vacation on the sofa! Educational for the kids too!"
positive,"easy to adjust: I used this to replace a broken, in ground sprinkler head. I was concerned about it holding up because it didn't seem as sturdy as what I normally use. It is very easy to adjust (no tools or wrenches needed)and seems to be holding up just fine."
positive,"Great for my shoes: This is a great shoo rack. It organizes my cluttered shoes and with its revolving functionality, I can easily find my shoes whenever I need them."
negative,"Better to get a root canal: First off, I like Rod Stewart. But this piece of dreck SHOULD be called ""The tape is full, when do I get paid?"". It's fun sometimes to hear a performer at a concert jump into an inspired cover. This is neither inspired, nor at a concert. It's a whole CD of, ""well I need some money and I am too lazy to even add something to a cover song, let alone actually come up with something new."" Bad enough it's all covers, his performance is lifeless, lethargic, and apathetic. Certainly, if I wanted to hear any of these songs, I would reach for the original first. This collection is unnecessary."
positive,"Great Book!: I was reluctant on reading this book at first because of its genre (historical fiction). The book started off slow, but sped up during the second chapter. I loved this book. It taught me many things and I will always remember it"
negative,"Agree with Ebert: I agree with Roger Ebert, this [was terrible]! I thought Crowe would be great, like he's a great actor! He [wasn't]! Pheonix had no depth like he did in Signs! He showed no enthusiasm, he was dull and his character was in love with his sister, how dumb is that? The sister wasn't any help! The hero was a gladiator, no problem there, only a dull gladiator, problem! The only one I liked was the slave that helped out Maximus(Crowe), he was pretty good! And of course, I like Russel Crowe but he was bad in this movie, get another one of his, any other of his is better then this,..."
positive,"Heard on HBO movie tonight, looked for Credits: I think it was the RED LETTERS? THE HBO movie that featured this song this evening. I waited for the credits, found out her name and called up her sites. These songs are awesome and her talent is awesome. Cant wait to see her on tour here in new haven, ct area :)"
positive,"Lord of the flies...: The lord of the flies is a very good book. I like the meaning of the book more than the story. It really makes you think. Everything you read has another meaning to it. For example the island they are on shows what is happening in the world. As they fall apart the world is too (the world is at nuclear war). The island is like a small version of the world or a ""Microcosm"". This book is not too long but is very difficult to understand. I found myself needing to read the chapters multiple times to understand them, but it is worth it. I recommend that everyone reads this book."
positive,"""A Bronx Tale,"" fantastic Robert DeNiro work.: ""A Bronx Tale"" is Robert De Niro's directorial debut and a superb exposition of his autobiographical story of how he grew up in the Bronx in the 60s, written by Chaz Palmenteri, who also plays the chief antagonist. I'm not certain that I've got here the best copy of the film...but that doesn't take away from the story's grip on my senses; it is exciting, quick-paced, well-acted and skillfully edited to show a powerful story of the lethal reigns of neighborhood power. I recommend this movie to all intending to be correctly informed on how our world really works."
positive,"I Loved You Once!: Poor Boris! He never gets the girl! In this movie, he is a mummy buried alive for reviving a dead girl he loved while alive. He finally finds her only to discover she loves another man and wants to stay alive! Poor thing! I hope everything turns out all right in the end and Boris doesn't get any murderous ideas! The original Mummy can't be beat. A special movie."
positive,Really keeps the coffee hot!: Got this for my hubby who drinks a great deal of coffee. He kept complainig about his coffee going cold while watching TV-- now he doesn't ! Very excellent product for a great price!
negative,"Not the message I want for my child: The message that we don't need fame or to be the strongest etc. to be happy is a good one, but this book sends a message which is not good. For example, the animal that goes to school spends his whole time memorizig things he doesn't understand, which, yes, is not good but to a child sends the message that school is not good. And then this hedgehog seems to get along knowing about herbs and things without having to work at all, and that more than anything is what's bad about this book. If you want to be good at holistic medicine (like this hedgehog :), you're going to have work for it, and not spend your days laying around in the garden."
positive,"Great heavy reading: Only if you are into heavy reading do you want to hit on this. It is great but as with any great author, requires a good vocabulary"
positive,"De Niro does it again: After seeing this film on large screen, I knew I wanted it for my own. De Niro's character is so convincing we forget the young, thin man of The Godfather or Taxi Driver. He's great. When I saw the film, I was one of 7 or 8 elderly women who comprised the audience at an early afternoon showing. I think young people may not have appreciated the story, but we old ladies thought it was definitely worth seeing."
positive,Measure of this Man!: The CD was even better then I could have wished for! My only complaint is that I wish there have been more songs to listen too! Just listening to the CD makes my heart sing and my soul melt. It has all the flavor that a person could stand! Can't wait until the next CD is released! Clay just keeps getting better with every song he sings!
negative,"Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams Movie!: This movie was terrible!""WARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLE!""Well it starts out with Davey, a drunk who is crude and mean. Then when he gets into trouble he's doomed to community service with the town migiet Whitney, (No offence to little people out there, that it not my intention to offend anyone). Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack, and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isn't any better.Well Davey does all he can to offend Whitney. That is until his place burns up! So he moves in with Whitney and his sister, and they set some ground rules. Then as the movie goes on, they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion, and when he cries it's all the sudden a big deal! And for some reason the deer in the woods talk, and help Whitney out. What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa Claus?I hate the music in it, the voices are annoying, and the characters are mostly unlikable! So warning to parents, keep your children locked up from this totally bad movie!"
positive,"Not just a ""Political"" Novel: As Orwell's 1984 is conventionally viewed as a ""political"" novel, it's value lies more in the deeper psychological meaning the book conveys, as Erich Fromm eloquently expounds in his afterword. More in this respect can the book be viewed as meaningful across both time and nation. It definitely is not just a novel for the disgruntled paranoids in our time and country as the political point of view might have it. As Fromm basically explains, the book is fundamentally an expression of the ""deepest alienation in the minds of organizational man"". In light of that, you might say that Dilbert lovers would appreciate the book."
positive,"It is a wonderful escape from reality: For those of you who read fiction an hour or so a day, this adventure story will give you something to live for. While reading the book, I relished the thought of getting home at night, exercising, doing my homework, opening a bag of good ole patatoe chips and then the ultimate escape ... cracking the best adventure story I have ever read. After reading Wilbur Smith, Clive Clussler will seem immature and childish. ""Birds of Prey"" is exciting, inspirational, and entertaining. It will pick you out of this world and deposit you in a world so real and vivid that you forget about the confines of your everyday existence."
positive,"Here Comes the Cavalry!: This movie is one part of the ""Cavalry Trilogy"" directed by John Ford. Ya gotta collect all three to get the best of the west from the U.S. Army's perspective. Hey, it's got John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Ward Bond, Shirley Temple (all grown up), and introduces handsome John Agar (Shirley Temple's future real-life husband). It's a great movie. If you have not seen it, you'll love it. If you have seen it before, you know what I mean."
negative,"astoundingly weak.: I got this CD for a buck and I want my buck back. After seeing some positive reviews and seeing that it reached # 1 on the college charts, I decided to risk a dollar on this incredibly bland ""bookbag rock"". I should've known better. Inbetween laughable Dave Matthews impersonations and shockingly mediocre Neil Young karaoke, you get his take on ""what if Trent Reznor accepted Jesus as his personal lord and saviour?"" on Track 11 ""Permission"". With no hooks to speak of, an annoying Christian bent, melodies that recall the worst 70's AM farm radio ever and covering up your inability to create anything even remotely catchy with electronic instrumentation, it all makes me wanna upchuck in my shorts. Damien Rice, Badly Drawn Boy, even Pete Yorn are doing what this guy is attempting to do and can actually DO IT. Seek them out, let this guy fall off the radar for good."
positive,"6 month old is in love...: My daughter just turned 6 months old and she loves this toy. I hear it go on in the middle of the night because she learned how to kick it on with her little feet, she doesn't wake up usually but when she does she kicks it on and soothes herself back to sleep. THANK YOU FISHER PRICE!!!!"
positive,"I Never Intended To Be A Soldier: This is the type of book very much needed to inform the up-coming generations about the actual history that has taken place, instead of some of the revised history being taught today. The writing was very well done and kept the reader engrossed. It was a remarkable Horatio Alger story and an inspiring one! It was written with toughness, yet tenderness at times. The author could serve as a role model for today's youth, injecting patriotism where very much needed."
positive,"Was it any good?....Yes! Definately!: Exciting music, classical yet rock and alternative with a hint of ethnicity! So much to listen for.... and the costumes were sleek and eye catching. Watching them perform on stage is so much fun and they're so energetic! WoW."
negative,"I'm shocked this is even from Brian McKnight: I just got the CD, browsed through the tracks in my car and can honestly say not one song sounded decent. I love his music and was waiting to get this one, but this has to be the worst album from him."
negative,Terrible quality: The blades that were provided were poor. They seemed like they were refurbished and felt like shaving with a toothed sawblade. Terrible and of course they are now not returnable since I opened to try them. Tried three blades and all were poor quality. I have used Fusion blades from other stores and they have been fine but not these!!
positive,Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits: This book is everything I expected. The pictures are great and the text very informative. I am enjoying it very much and it is a valued addition to my film library.
negative,"Problem with charging smaller AAAs: I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is."
positive,"Works and lives of great masters by their contemporary: ""Do you admire a beautiful tower resounding with sacred sound?By my design this tower also reached for the stars.But I am Giotto, why cite such deeds?My name alone is worth a lengthy ode.""[From the Live of Giotto di Bondone]Classic masterpiece containing selection of lives of famous Italian masters of art, written by their (almost) conterporary. This work is tedious and difficult to read at times (Vasari is describing at length all importatnt works of old masters). But still, this account is valuable for particular details about techniques used by old masters or condidtions under which their masterpieces were created... Kind regards, Mario."
positive,"Great value for prep material!!: Questions cover, with excellent difficulty, all areas of exam 70-229. These are the style of questions all Microsoft exams should contain to maintain the credibility of their certifications.This review is a good heads up on how Microsoft is changing their exams to cover hands on work experience versus fact regurgitation. Very handy sample Exam on CD with Questions randomly generated from the Readiness Reveiw.A better publication than the 70-229 Study Kit."
negative,"Does not work with PowerMac G5: Although the specifications state compatibility with macs G3 or higher, this card will not fit into the pci slot of a new G5.(...)"
negative,"Save your time and money: Kettlebell Bombshell with Lisa BalashI too was very disappointed with this DVD. I own quite a few workout DVDs as I like to exercise in the privacy of my own home. I've really gotten into kettle bells so I was excited when I read the reviews. It seems to give good instruction, but that's about it. The workouts aren't much of a workout. There are three minute rests between moves. I could drive to McDonald's and eat a cheeseburger before she starts on the next one. I guess you could hold the remote and keep fast-forwarding, but I have better things to do. This is the only workout DVD I've ever requested a refund for. The long, positive reviews must be from friends and business associates."
positive,Grandchild pleaser: I bought this for my granddaughter's 4th birthday but what I liked about it was that she could understand how to play it (with help) and it was challenging enough for her 7 yr old brother to be interested and want to play it with her.
positive,Absoutely beautiful.... and pure genius.: Where to begin... This Album is absolutely gorgeous. It is eerything it should be and more. If you love any and all types of music... this one's for you!!! (I own it and love it.)
positive,"Awaiting a Theatrical Release: The Hobbit is a delightful cartoon epic based on J.R.R. Tolkien's 1937 classic. For a film that was made in 1977, a time when the quality of animation was already in sharp decline, the artwork and scenes are quite superb.Though I would like to have seen more than just 78 minutes portrayed on the screen, this version, nonetheless, is a good series of highlights from the story, itself. Also noteworthy is that the transition from one scene to the next was done in such a way that the characters, both individually and as a group, were easy to identify and remember.If you are looking for good-quality entertainment for nearly all ages, The Hobbit is highly recommended. For the audiophiles out there, there is neither Dolby nor DTS stereo surround sound, for the release is presented only in mono. Nonetheless, it is a worthwhile purchase."
negative,Dragon Fire: I just could not read it; it was too violent and ugly. Perhaps it was just me but I couldn't get past the first chapter.
negative,"****DO NOT BUY FROM This Un-Authorized Distributor****: This is not a compliant distributor. They are in violation of herbalife rules. While the discounted prices are tempting, they are not authorized by herbalife. Chances are you are getting old products, and will not be followed up with. This person will also be losing their distributor ship.***DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON***"
negative,"Some chapters were good, some were bad, all in all just okay: I got this book as a free gift for attending a CRM conference. Some of the author's points are valid--the book was probably written before a lot of this material became obvious. (One of these days, I'm going to find a book that says ""People issues don't matter if your company's managers don't have a customer focus or your firm doesnt have the necessary IT infrastructure in place."" Can't wait for that.)I worked for Lucent in the 1990s and would swear that we coined the phrase ""People Process and Technology."" Anyway, it's been worn pretty thin. The tone of the book was a bit pedantic and stiff and so I found it a bit hard to to get through. I like Paul Greenberg's and Jill Dyche's CRM books much better, though, and would recommend them over this one, along with a new book called ""Why They Don't Buy"" by Max McKeown that is definitely the go-to book for CRM automation!"
positive,"Leon Ware is Genius: I am a very big fan of Leon's work. He is so underrated, He is Genius. When it comes to Leon, it's who hasn't he worked with because many of the greats of R&B/Jazz have written with him or covered his tunes. By the way, whom ever wrote in the editioral section that Minnie Riperton later covered ""Inside My Love"" is wrong...Minnie, Richard Rudolph and Leon wrote this(and several other tunes) in 1975 and it's featured on Minnie's ""Adventures In Paradise"". It is an R&B Classic.... Leon did his version in 1979. Research before writing! :)"
positive,Pleasingly Funny: This was the first book of David's which I read. It came as a recommendation from a friend. I found myself unable to put it down. Most people will easily relate to the stories of his childhood. I highly recommend this as a first book if you have never had the privilege of experiencing David Sedaris.
negative,"'Skulls' hits a nail, dead in the head.: I have gone to a museum and seen more life in a skull, than in the film The Skulls, a cheesy teen thriller about a college student who reluctanley gets into a secret society, named for the title, The Skulls and then procedes to find flaws in it, only then wanting to get out, and discovering the only way out, is to die. The only thing thats worth watching in this bore fest is Lesley Bibb, who we dont even get to see as much as we'd like. There is no suspence in this suspence, and no depth with the charactors, other than that they would pretty much do anything to get into a ""secret society."" The directings not all that bad, but it doesnt help, the actings not either, like i said with the exception of Bibb, and the writings not even all that swell. The Skulls did resemble a teenage version of The Firm, which was a way better film all together, but what can you expect from the whole set of the WB. Just kidding."
positive,Captivates my daughter...: My 4 month old daughter is just starting to learn that she can affect the world and this toy is helping to teach that lesson. This is the first toy that she has ever been able to turn on and off by herself. She was stunned the first time she hit the blue bar and the lights and sound went off. She was thrilled when she hit it again and everything came back on. It keeps her interest about 10 minutes at a time --which is no small feat for a baby her age. The only problem I have is how to attach it to the crib with the bumper pad in the way --and still have it low enough for her to reach. I'm still trying to figure that out.
positive,"Great collection of hit but...: If you are a great fan like me and already have all the cd collection, there's no need for this one. You already have most of it, what is missing is ""Shaking the tree""... there is a better version of it on ""Secret World Live"", a piano version of ""Here comes the flood"" ... there is a better version on Growing up Live (DVD) what's left is a new mix of ""I have the touch"" and ""Zaar"" which is not a memorable song.Be aware also that some of the songs have been edited to a shorter version.I would add that the hits are not the best songs of Peter Gabriel, the rest of his material is better. This cd is for completist or for someone who want to own only one cd of the artist (which is a mistake !)"
negative,"Boring book: I had to buy this book for a class. It is the most BORING book ever. If you don't have to buy this, please save yourself the misery of having to read it and don't!"
positive,Excellent doors CD: This CD just has an excellent sound quality and has a the best recording live of horse latitudes I have ever heard. a must have for the true doors fan.
negative,"The Oddball Eloise Book: This is BY FAR THE WORST Eloise book. So many people wrote glowing reviews that I bought it, but really... it's awful. The main thing you need to know is that unlike the other Eloise books, this one is all in VERSE, and, although I love Kay Thompson, she's no Dr. Seuss. If you need another fix of Eloise, buy Eloise In Paris instead."
positive,best markers ever: i bought this marker set as gift for my boyfriend and he LUVS it! he set theyre the best markers he's ever had.
positive,"Patrick Stewart is awesome!: For fans of Patrick Stewart, this is an awesome rendition of an old favorite. His one man show on the London stage must've been spectacular! His acting makes the role very believable. The person playing Bob Cratchit is also very believable.Edit: This is for the movie. I did not purchase the book. Just noticed they labelled it as a book."
positive,"Great Gritty Clean: Fast Orange, at the best price, buy 2 and get free shipping, a great deal. Need I say more?"
positive,"5 stars for Five Star: This is a great debut from the british sibling group Five Star released in 1985, it's songs are uptempo and catchy, quite bubbly but fun to listen too, it has a mixture of groovy R&B, dancey pop, and smooth ballads, a must cd for any fan of 80's music"
positive,"Could not put it down: The books was wonderful. I read the book in two sittings, and did not want the book to end."
negative,"This book is a fraud: I am a confirmed Feynman fan and even met him a couple of times. I was eager to learn more about him and his travels. The subtitle promised details of his ""last journey"", which, it turns out, he never made. Instead, I was bored with insipid details of the author's attempts to arrange a trip to the USSR and other assorted junk. It did not even spend much time on Tuva itself, but on unrelated trivia. It was apparent that the author was immensely more interested in the trip than Feynman, and that even he wasn't interested enough to stay at it to fruition. The author trades on the Feynman name to shamelessly promote the book and con the reader into plodding through endless drivel. Don't bother."
positive,"A few excellent songs shine through the retreads: This album should have been great. It should have been the best album of the 1990s. However, the band doesn't seem nearly as motivated and hungry as before. Some songs are just too long, too familiar and too boring. But, songs like ""D'You Know what I mean"" and ""Fade In/Out"" among others are well done songs that feature Oasis trying to alter their musical style (albeit not by too much). Bottom line: It's great rock n' roll music. However the energy is more intense on their previous albums. It's still better than most rock music out today. Look for their next album in 2000, chances are their hunger will return and it will be one of the best albums in the last 5 years."
positive,"emporio Armani mens colgne: Such a wonderful cologne. It makes the person smell fresh, and clean, yet sexy and young. The price of the Emporio is not to bad, and it is sure worth it. I have had my man use it for a very long time, and will keep using it. I would recomment this to anyone..thank you"
negative,huh?: I just don't get it? I thought this book was a story about the paranormal and all the town needed to do was buy some Raid.Also anybody can tell you moths just son't grow that big... now June Bugs well now that's a story.
negative,"Great... if you like your guns and mags in a pile...: Cheap was what I was looking for, and unfortunately what I got. I figured it'd be inexpensive and a good value like other Plano cases I've bought for other purposes. I placed a couple of pistols and magazines in the case, closed it, picked it up and heard noise. Set it back down and opened it to find my pistols and magazines slouched to the hinge side of the case.Ok, so there is pick and pluck, but if you use that, you have only one layer, not the two advertised. Weak.I just bought a Seahorse instead, I've used that brand for my camera gear and trust it as much as Pelican."
positive,"Good case: This is a great case for a semi-auto or revolver. I use it with a Ruger 9mm. It easily holds the pistol and 2 clips with just enough room to spare. I can close the case and shake it and nothing moves inside.It has a spot for a small lock which would be effective to keep children out, but that's really the only use."
positive,"My favorite LIVE Stones CD: Great from beginning to end. Wore the tape out and just recently got the CD. Also recently got the ""No Security"" one and like it a lot, but this one edges it out for me. Fav. track: ""Ruby Tuesday."""
negative,"Horrible product, wish I could give it negative stars....: This is just a horrible product. If you want to waste $72 on a product that will ruin your skin, look no further. If you want to breakout horribly even if you don't normally and to have an awful rash on your face for days, this is the product for you. If you want to have to deal with a company that just doesn't care about anything except for making a quick buck, buy from MD Skincare."
negative,"Nothing Like Described: Received the product and it is NOTHING like described. Instead of the item as shown, the item is only a short stomach wrap and not a more full body item as pictured. Returned."
negative,Viewer from NY: I am in complete agreement with the viewer from MN as to the unfortunate full screen format this DVD version was produced in. What a blunder! What a loss of visual information so important to the script! I have had to make a VHS recording off of TCM when THEY presented the movie in its' Letterbox format. I hope someone smartens-up and rereleases Moonstruck on DVD that delivers all the great cinematography.
positive,"Product review - filter: It's a filter! I haven't installed it yet and probably won't for years as it's a spare but when I do I bet it will filter just like a filter or possibly even more so. If so, it may well exceed my filtration expectations. I would not recommend the purchase this product to anyone who doesn't need one."
positive,"One of the best movies in the past twenty years.: For those of you out there who read the reviews that said it didn't have much or a plot or was poorly written, don't believe them. This movie is very well written and has a very good, yet, clandestine, plot. Don't believe that is unrealistic, either. The only part that might fringe on the ""unrealistic"" side is at then end, and even that is pretty close to realism. All in all, a fantastic film. Good acting, good plot, good action, and highly entertaining. I recommend it to anyone."
positive,"Worth a try: I am normally very faithful about using Pampers Swaddlers because they are so absorbent but Swaddlers aren't bigger than size 3 so I thought I would give these a try for when we outgrow the Swaddlers. The Baby Dry was cheaper per diaper than Swaddlers and Cruisers. I am very pleased with the diapers, however, my son does leak through overnight. I don't know if the diaper is totally to blame because he does sleep on his stomach some of the time and he is a super soaker at night! I have been using these diapers for 4 weeks and I have enough diapers left to last another 2-3 weeks! I think I will try Cruisers next to have something else to compare to. We definitely prefer the Pampers brand!!"
positive,"Amazing sound and comprehensive collection: Amazing sound quality and a more comprehensive selection than the recent ""Greatest Hits"" CD for just a few dollars more makes this the definitive one-package EW&F collection and the place to start for those curious about the late-1970s number one R&B/funk outfit."
negative,Very disapointing.: I am a huge Allman Brothers fan. I bought the disk thinking it was a concert video. Nothing but interviews with music playing in the background. Luckily I was able to exchange it for something else. Cannot belive the A-Bros would endorse this .
positive,"Fantastic Item: This purchase exceeded my expectations, with this item i can control my Ipod thru the receiver and view all the tracks etc on my TV screen.Oh did i mention the clarity of the music......."
positive,"The Last Unicorn: In very good condition after ""flying"" from another side of the world to Asia - Singpore. Good job! Thanks!"
positive,"Kerouac's finest, most blissful novel...you MUST read it!: Yes, ""On The Road"" gets all the attention, but this follow-up work is by far his most gorgeous and uplifting...from sleeping on the beach to climbing a mountain, to the flowering of his Buddhist consciousness, Jack really takes the reader with him. Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. ""Dharma Bums"" soars as high as ""Big Sur"" dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors."
positive,"I will set the building on fireif you don't give me my stapler...: This movie is absolutely incredible. Stephen Root makes this movie a classic with his ""I will set the building on fire"" lines. No one could have performed this part better. All of us have had a job like this. That fax machine that says there is a paper jam when there is no paper jam. That boss who just doesn't get that you might have a life outside of work. Those thoughts about stealing millions from the company. And most importantly, that dream we have all had about seeing the building go up in flames. Ahhhh, poetic justice."
negative,"1:30 minutes of torture: This film contains some of the worst acting I have ever seen. Possibly the worst acting ever. Second, the premise of the plot is ridiculous. Science fiction should have some basis in um....Science. The premise of the movie is that the device was created to manipulate DNA to heal wounds. A wound healing device would be a great plot for science fiction movie but it would not have to manipulate DNA to do it. It's clear the writers do not know what DNA is. It sounded cool so they put it in. Bai Ling is awful, but not as bad as the other actors."
negative,"Ruby Payne claptrap: This book is designed to alleviate the poverty of the author at the expense of children in classes with teachers who have absorbed her awful message. As a cultural anthropologist with 35 years of research experience in urban American, I can say without hesitation that this is not just over-simplified; it is a set of racist stereotypes that have been adduced without any kind of systematic or acceptable evidence. She has made a fortune as a ""motivational speaker."" She is no scholar, and her work can worsen the very problems she claims to be trying to solve."
positive,"Excellent!: Bought this for use with an xBox 360 on a plasma tv. After switching from the standard RWY coaxial xBox connectors to this HDMI cable, the difference was INCREDIBLE! This cable worked perfectly, and you can't beat the price!"
negative,"Malfunction and battery doesn't last long: Got this about 6 weeks ago. One week into it, the device started getting ""stuck"" on rewind. It's supposed to stop rewinding when you release pressure on the wheel, which it still sometimes does successfully. About half the time, though, it gets stuck on rewind and the only thing I can do is turn it off, none of the other functions (like play or stop) work.Newer problem: it's supposed to skip to the next track when you hit the fast forward button twice. It did that in the beginning, now it usually doesn't, same thing with trying to go to a previous track.Either I got a lemon or this device is poor quality. This is my first MP3 player so I have no basis for comparison regarding battery life but it seems the battery drains very quickly."
negative,"John Douglas Sold Out: John Douglas sold himself out to the Ramseys. Acting as a paid consultant, he met with them and reviewed evidence and the crime scene. He criticizes colleagues and other law enforcement that believe the Ramseys are guilty. Mr Douglas did not work for the Boulder police or the D.A. so the evidence he reviewed was that which was made available by the Ramseys.If this isn't tainted, I don't know what is.The rest of the book rehashes old cases and does not offer any new information. It's a waste of time and money. Mr Douglas should be ashamed of himself for selling out."
negative,"I THINK THAT MARILYN MANSON SUX AND HE IS A IDIOT: ANYONE WHO WOULD TAKE THEIR RIBS OUT SO THAT THEY COULD GIVE THEMSELVES A _____ iS A FREAK. I LIKE MARILYNS MUSIC, BUT HATE THE WAY HE DOES HIS VIDEOS AND PRESENTS HIMSELF. HE SCARES ME"
negative,"The point: I totally missed the point of the novel. Maybe I need a professor to explain the satire but I did not get it. I kept waiting for the story to tell me something about myself or about society - it never did. After reading some of your reviews, I am led to believe that I totally missed the boat. Did I really?"
positive,"Amazing Advice: Wow!! This book is awesome. It is soo true, I recently got involved in a relationship and everything the book says is true. I learned a lot how to respect myself and turn my life more independent. Great relationship book."
negative,"Seller is the problem: The razor works just fine, as expected. The problem I had was with the seller. I was asked to rate my experience with the seller (not a product review). I gave them one star only, because I felt the $11.95 USPS shipping charge for a product weighing about one pound was excessive. It was like I kicked a hornet's nest. I received two telephone calls from the seller demanding I retract my poor review. They also sent me two e-mails instructing me how to make the retraction.This part may be hard to believe: the second caller, who identified herself as the Customer Service Supervisor told me they fake the shipping weight as 4 pounds in the Amazon listing, raise the S&H; fee and reduce the razor an equivelent amount so the razor will be competitively priced. HUH?I hope this is not a widespread practice. I am a frequent Amazon customer and I just want to place my orders without thinking about what games people might be playing."
negative,"Man Facing Southeast remake?: In the credits no reference is made to the remarquable 1986 Argentinean film ""Man Facing Southeast"". Even if there is no admitted connection between the two, K-PAX could easily be mistaken for a remake of this movie, and not a very good remake at that. It lacks the deapt and refinement of the ""original"". So why bother with K-PAX, if you can find ""Man Facing Southeast"" treat yourself to a real masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made."
positive,loreal cream for wrinkles: I could barely miss the wrinkles but it felt wonderful on the face. Worth the buy just for the soft way it leaves your face.
positive,"Legends of the Mighty Sioux by Workers of the South Dakota Writers' Project: A compilation of forty-five legends of the famous Sioux Indians of South DakotaAll of the legends pertain to traditional Sioux lore, to tales told around the campfire, and legends associated with places and hunting grounds.ISBN-13: 9780913062319"
negative,"Krakauer Lite: I have to agree with others reviewers that Kocuour's ego is a huge obstacle in reading this book. I'm reminded of people who in conversation do nothing but bad-mouth others to compensate for their lack of confidence. Everyone else is weak, unrefined, stupid, or otherwise worth mocking. I'm stuck with the passage where she gets mocks a fellow climber who has brought a book to read about jet airplanes. That's the depth she goes to in her pettiness.The story itself is interesting and should be compelling, but getting past the author's tone soured the reading experience for me.I have many mountaineering books. Ones I'd heartily recommend are Joe Tasker and Peter Boardman's ""The Boardman Tasker Omnibus"", Jim Whittaker's ""A Life on the Edge"" and Peter Potterfield's ""In the Zone"". These authors not only write well, but can convey the challenges and trials of mountaineering without narcissism. These books all sit proudly in my bookcase. Kocuour's book is in a cardboard box in my basement."
positive,Excellent Work: Great book. Really helpful and easy to follow. I know it will come in handy because I am not the best at speaking or writing.Thank you!
positive,"A QUIET Bone that my dog loves!: My two dogs have been addicted to theNylabone Dura Chew Bonesfor quite a while. I have ordered them multiple times, and try to always keep two or three available to them at all times.HOWEVER, I decided to try this Rhino Bone as a special little present for them. Not only do they love it, but the obnoxious ""dog chewing on a bone"" sound is completely eliminated. No matter how much they gnaw on this bone, they do not damage it or make a peep.I won't say it completely replaces the standard bones, but it sure is nice when they pick up this bone to chew on. After all, shouldn't every dog be spoiled with a little chew toy variety? ;-)"
negative,"The worst of the worst: For many years, when I was asked what the worst movie of all time was, I would answer DefCon4. Without hesitation or a second lost trying to decide. DefCon4 was the easy answer.I have not seen DefCon4 for many years now, and have come to call this period of time ""the age of reason"". And while Dracula: Dead and Loving It has seemed to take DefCon4's place as the most rancid piece of waste that I have ever seen, I still hold a special place in my lower intestine for that movie."
negative,"**** never received this dvd from amazon: On 4/13/09 I ordered 2 dvds (Flashdance and Dirty Dancing). I received Flashdance almost immediately, but to this day, I have never received Dirty Dancing. I just received my bank statement this week and Amazon withdrew funds for both movies (Flashdance - $6.43 / Dirty Dancing - $22.94) on 4/14/09. Please help me straighten this out.Laurie Mobilia"
negative,Not so good: These headphones do not stay on your ears. Maybe if they were like the other wrap arounds.A good idea but more of a hinderance of keeping them on the ears.
negative,Its a pack with no power: I purchased this item to be used at tradeshows and was very disappointed with the outcome. The item was supposed to power a flourescent light for 23 hours and the alarm went off at only 3. I wouldnt buy this item again.
positive,"Totally worth the money and extra cleaning!: Ava is our first child and a friend of ours recomended Dr. Browns bottles-- We registered for another kind along with the Dr. Browns, and we WON'T use the others. Ava doesn't have the spit ups, or near the gas that you hear and read that babies have. AND burping is so easy! We have been so happy with the entire set! All of my friends and family having babies, I have told them they HAVE to have these bottles, they are a life saver! We will never use another brand of bottles!"
positive,A wonderful record of Broadway: I bought this DVD after seeing segments of it on YouTube. I LOVE IT! I laugh at one of the other reviewers who panned it because they were expecting clips of old Broadway numbers - read the product description! Amazing bits and explanations of things you would never know from reading a few books because the interviewees were there when it happened. Yes - there are clips to punctuate things - even a clip of Laurette Taylor speaking - what a gem! 100s of still photos you've never seen before! And the truth about what happened to Shirley McLaine that fateful performance - from Shirley herself!My only complaint is that track 21 - the section on Brando- SKIPS - no matter what machine I play it on - so my copy has a definite production flaw in it! I recommend this to anyone who loves theatre and loves older Broadway shows and stars.
positive,"A Must Have For Any WWII Buff: With a star studded cast, along with the story of the greatest military invasion in history, this is one DVD set that must be included in the collection of any World War II history buff."
positive,"80's Animation Fan: I grew up with this movie, and I absolutely love it. It is very fantasy based, and NOT girly in my opinion. I bought the movie to show my Husband and although he's typically open minded, he was opening complaining about NOT wanting to see it. He ultimately humored me, and we watched it, and I remembered all the awesome imagery and the interesting story.When it was over he said h liked it, but it was more of a ""meh"" reaction. As for me, I suppose I am still a fan because I have such fond memories of it from when I was a kid, so buy it for your kids! You may find your self loving it to. HEY! Here's a thought, did the company ""Red Bull"" get their name from this movie? Think about it. ;)"
positive,"MASTERPIECE: A while ago I was browsing reviews of Candide on this very site, and I found one that nearly made me hurl. The reviewer said that the book is no longer applicable to the world because Voltaire's fight had been won: that is to say religious intolerance and ignorance have been banished. I never agreed with that reviewer's assesment. In light of September 11, my disagreement is further entrenched in my body. Religious ignorance is still running amuck in the hills and desert dunes, and right in our own backyard. Has Voltaire's war been won? No, I don't think so. We're in the middle of it right now. Candide helped take the religious fanaticism out of Europe, perhaps some new translations in arabic and whatever languages are spoken in Afghanistan should be dropped from the back of planes along with the bombs. The book would probably have a better impact. What's the cliche? The pen is mighter than the sword."
negative,"Shower Curtain Rod Review: Umbra Coretto 24 to 36-Inch Decorative Tension Rod, BlackThe rod is really good looking. However, because it is so thin, the weight of my shower curtain keeps causing the rod to come loose. If I had any idea, I probably would not have bought the rod. However, my shower is at the wider end....so maybe a person would have better luck if their shower is closer to 24""."
positive,"How can one movie describe a state so well?: The movie is so acurate as to the feeling of basketball in the state of Indiana. I grew up there and the electricity surrounding the game is unparrelled any where in the world. I think the movie does a great job of showing how the people of Indiana: eat, sleep, and breath basketball"
positive,"Good Service: Came quickly, no problems at all. Very competitive price. Note that the Chamberlain and LiftMaster versions of this switch are interchangable. I have both. Note that the Chamberlain version has better illumination on the button (the whole square lights up), while the LiftMaster only has a small LED in the center. However, I didn't think this was worth an extra $10!"
positive,"a good story with a exellent actress: but the one thing that i didnt exepted is the end of the movie i didnt exept it like that, it wasnt on my mind i was thinking that something terrible will happening when i saw the movie at the first but i cant tell it`s a bad! it`s not couse it is an old movie you exept any thing couse its old but at the end it is a classic movie i cant say it`s horror half by half"
negative,Lacking: This book lacks the depth it seems to promise. Some of the illustrations are lacking. There is not enough meat to help anyone with special needs learners. I would suggest you look elsewhere. I was greatly disappointed since the majority of work by Jensen is wonderful.
positive,A Love Supreme Indeed!: This is an amazing recording that deals with spirituality and an unconditional love that we should all give to each other as humanbeings. This recording is flawless including the extras that are included on the bonus cd which includes his only Live performance of A Love Supreme as well as many outtakes which includes Archie Shepp who was a close friend and collaborator playing his screechy Sax on the alternate recordings of Acknowledgement. I think everyone should buy this recording it is very creative and innovative for 1964.
negative,"A tangled mess: This is one of the least inspired and entertaining mysteries I've encountered in years. The plot is ridiculously complex (and silly), the camera work is irritating, the hero is a raunchy oaf, and the writer has badly confused Anglo-Catholicism with Catholicism in his portrayal of an English church. Even the quality of the picture is not that great. Stay away from this one."
positive,"Still not afraid to try something new.: Pearl Jam is one of the few bands left that isn't afraid to take risks (as they do frequently on their latest) and do something that's, well...just not like them.Examples with this disk: 1)there are several songs that Vedder had nothing to do with the writing of 2)there are just as many typically abrassive and radio-unfriendly songs as there are <gasp!> catchy and almost fun songs (watch for Vedder's ukelele).So far my favorites are the first single, Ament's almost Pink Floyd-like ""Nothing As It Seems"", and the driving, melodic ""Light Years"". The usual hints at influence form The Who (the opening to ""Breakerfall"" strongly echoes ""I Can See For Miles""), and Neil Young (I'm still convinced he has some uncredited solos on here somewhere).Great music, great lyrics, definitely a great break from the manufactured garbage that's making it all over the radio."
negative,"They break: I purchased 4 of the 1000VA models, one did not even start out of the box and out of the other three, two lasted less than 6 months prior to going pop and smoke. Forget warranties, if you want to spend several hours arguing on the phone, good luck. I eventual replace the first one but took almost 2 months the rest weren't worth. They worked fine, but so did a Yugo car!"
positive,"an album you just gotta hear !: No-Man - FlowermouthWith odes to minimalism, chill beat and art rock genres, No-Man's Flowermouth is an album like no others. Flowermouth is full of lavish orchestration, deep and resonating tones and a certain tranquility with a creative calmness all surrounding it. Musically this is deep contemplative music as sung by Tim Bowness put to the creative instrumentation of Steve Wilson.On a number of No-Man albums King Crimson's Robert Fripp made a guest appearance as he did on Flowermouth. Wilson also ropes in the likes of Richard Barbieri , Steve Jansen, Chris Maitland (the usual suspects) to assist in musically portraying this album.And to top it all off Lisa Gerard's voice of Dead Can Dance graces this album on ""Simple"". Steve Wilson sampled her voice and incorporated it into the song and liked it so much that he gave her credit for guest appearing on the album !Flowermouth is a great pop-synth-aart-rock album that get my vote as an album you JUST GOTTA HEAR !"
positive,Test: Test test team to the point of this is not the point is you reality that the government of India
negative,Jacked Up!!!!: Seriously???? This movie was jacked up! Like a Ground Hogs Day only worse.. way worse. I can't even explain how bad this movie is. Some of you people rated this 4 and 5 stars??? What the hell are you smoking and PLEASE send some my way so I can watch this movie again and see is it gets any better!
negative,"2/3 of a great book, then... blah: I listened to the audio version of ""Cruel & Unusual"" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the ""who"" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, ""great book, bad ending..."" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?"
positive,"Good No Limit Release: Third No Limit release of 2000, and NL has definetely improved. The beats are better, and C-Murder is definetely doing his own thing w/ TRU Records and keeping the No Limit style. The best songs are 2,3,4,5,7,12,15,17,18,22,23,and 24."
positive,"Poor Harry!!!!: This is one of the funniest books that I've encountered in some time. All Harry wants to do is take a little boat trip, maybe do some fishing, and relax. If page one is an indication of the things to come, it's not good news for Harry. We see a seagull trying to break open a clam shell by dropping it on Harry's head. He gets caught in a storm and is stranded on an island with a lot of rocks, a scraggly tree, and an egg. As the egg hatches Harry figures it must be a bizzard, but comes to the realization that it's actually a dragon, a dragon that is continually eyeing Harry going ""Mmmmmmmmmmm"". The ending is a delightful twist and a valuable lesson is learned--there are fates far worse than death.Don't pass this book up. A good number of titles out there can have the reader laughing on the first page but, can't deliver. This one does.Poor Harry!!!"
negative,"""Best Picture""??? Please....: This is a perfect example of how Hollywood politics often influence the Academy Awards. Because despite the enormous marketing muscle behind it, this film is essentially a B movie with grade A special effects. The acting is okay and the story is alright. But come on. This has to be the longest film ever made that contains no character development whatsoever. In a nutshell, after spending gobs of money producing it, the studio executives commanded that this movie win the big award. And ""the people"" obeyed."
positive,Great stuff: There must be loop holes in this film but it was so darn good I wont even bother looking for them.
negative,"Good book but not a teaching text: It is important to be forewarned that this is not a good text for an introductory logic class. I have taught classes using several other texts, and, although they had their flaws, the Forbes' text has flaws that are almost unsurmountable for the typical lower-division college student. The explanations, though creative,are not clear enough, and the flow of topics is out of sorts. For example, the exercises which accompany the sections start out too difficult to be any aid in helping the introductory student grasp the techniques. In short, for upper-division courses or for people who already have a logic background, this is an interesting book and might be worth a look, but it fails miserably as an introductory text."
negative,Doesn't do timeshifting with my Mitsubishi: This product I got yesterday doesn't do all its features when connected to my Mitsubishi 62525. It seemed to work ok but when I actually tried to record something it would lose its connection. Will probably return it if I can't get it to be stable this weekend.
negative,"""Dressy Lace-up"": Be aware that this shoe--in a WIDE- is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide. The shoe runs narrow. However,it does come in an Extra Wide. Although the shoe has little to no arch support,it is, nevertheless a ""dressy"" alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet."
positive,Great fun for the whole family: Everyone I know loves this game and has a hard time finding it. Wal-Mart never has it. The pieces are small so easily lost but it is a fun game for the whole family.
positive,"A classic!: Tillich is one of the most creative and influential theologians and philosophers of the twentieth century. He is particuluarly influential here in America. When this book was first issue it was recognized as one of the great books of popular philosophy/theology yet written. In it, Tillich takes the reader through the different ways a person can be (essentially different ways of living). The reader will find this book not only useful in terms of their own self evaluation and helping others, but they will find it a book that, when properly understood, changes peoples lives. A word to the wise: Many people have complained that this book is a little difficult to read at first. This is because Tillich uses terminology which he has invented. He is not always good about telling the reader know what he means. However, after you read more and more of the book you get a good grasp of what he means. Stick with it. You wont be sorry."
positive,"Mest is the Best: First of I have to say, I don't personally own the Destination Unknown cd, but I have heard the songs from it and let me say that they are great. I recently saw Mest in concert and the songs from Destination Unknown were so awesome. Personally, anything from Mest is good to me, but the difference and variation of these songs is just the best. If this is your type of music, I'm sure that you'll love Destination Unknown."
positive,"European Film At It's Best: Run Lola Run is an intense suspense film. When Lola's boyfriend looses 100,000 DM from a drug drop and has to have it by noon he calls up Lola in desprate need of help. After suggesting to rob a grocery store, Lola pleeds with him not to and the movie kicks into three senarios of what may happen. Every time Lola gets the money, but it's a question of if she gets it there too late or if her or her boyfriend might even die first. The soundtrack is also amazing adding for an even larger on-the-edge-of-your-seat sensation."
positive,it's different: ok so it doesn't have michael and it is misleading us by saying halloween 3 but oh well the movie itself is pretty good i mean it's better than a lot of the other cheap slashers that came out in it's time.
positive,Bach Organ Works on original organs: 121 organ tracks or works on 16 CDs has to be spaced out in about six days. The music is so restful I found myself dowsing. The price for a new set through Amazon was right. Bach organ hymns made Luther.
negative,Nephew hated it: I bought this for a birthday gift for my 8 year old nephew. He hated it. It does not contain the Three Stooges TV episodes we all watched as kids. Brother-in-law said it is a bunch of vaudeville stuff.
positive,"AMAZING!: I got this HD-DVD from this website for like 13 bucks and watch the Batman Begins on my add-on 360 HD-DVD drive, the picture are amazing on my Optoma HD70 on my 25 ft wall, amazing detail and so ALIVE! The story is almost perfect, but what is missing is Danny Elfman music and I missed the tone of Batman Return which is one of the top 2 batman movie ever filmed. Yes, I mean Batman Return and Batman Begins... they're both amaziong and well-made movie. I can't wait to get the rest of the other batman movies on HD-DVD!"
positive,good listening: i have owned more than one copy of this cd. both were stolen. i would purchase it again.
positive,Robin Hood: We are in the process of updating our Disney movie collection from VHS to DVD since we no longer have a VCR.
negative,"NOT Blu-ray Quality - DVD Quality on Blu-ray disc: I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Waited for it to come out on Blu-ray and was really looking forward to seeing this in HD, but unfortunately the quality is only DVD quality, so a waste to buy it on Blu-ray if you already have it on DVD. (viewed on a 60"" HDTV)"
negative,"A typical anti-Darwinism pseudoscience book: The book contains 280 pages of text, 25 pages of refenreces, 7 pages of INDEX, and many figures and cartoon to explain the concept of author's hypothesis. Barbieri was a development biologist at MRC in Cambridge, NIH, and Max Planck.This is a typical anti-Darwinism semi-pseudoscience book. I picked up the book because the book cover had a Chomsky's accolade. It's not as obvious and outrageous as Intelligent Desing-sort of book, but the author cites his own book to explain his main points. Many biological facts in the book are real and correct, but there is no scientific logical structure to support the author's ""semantic"" theory. I was struck by the fact that this book was published from Cambridge University Press."
positive,"No time to chill - get it now. Hurry!!!: This is one of the best works by german group SCOOTER. The album starts with an deep intro and suddenly kicks off with its best track "" How much is da fish.."". ""Call me manana"", similiar to that, follows up shortly. I personally enjoy song No.10 "" Everything is borrowed"", great example of transe techno. CD's is definitely worth buying, it will be a great addition to a your DJ collection."
negative,How did this get published?: That so much sturm and drang occurs in the first 10 pages is amazing. It's also hard to believe that there really was a great meeting-of-the-mind relationship between Abby and Bobby in that after his having been away for so long in the Navy their communciation skills seem to be reduced to the bed. I had to stop reading this book which is rare. For me a novel with two authors rings warning bells. And unfortunately this was no exception. Really hack work that makes one wonder why it got past some editor's slush pile. I'd have given it no stars if I could have done.
positive,"Jane Austin works: The volumes I purchased all prove excellent. These are texts most useful in an academic environment in contrast to casual reading. As such, they are splendid."
positive,"Top Of My List: A very witty, funny, insightful and honest book that had surely passed the test of time. With her brilliant writing, Erica Jong had candidly and courageously voiced the hope, the fear, the joy, the anxiety, the desire, and the frustration of being a woman. She did all this with a wonderful sense of humor.I've enjoyed this book very much and more than one time. It has a permanent place on my nightstand. Every time, I want something good to read, I just simply pull this book out, randomly open at any page and start reading. Works every time. Thank you Erica Jong!"
negative,"Crap: This dvd was in some other region format, wouldnt even play on my dvd player. They should be more specific when offering products that arent compatible with us electronics ! I will never shop here again!"
negative,"Do Not Buy This Book: I do not think I am exagerating when I write that this woman has created an empire in which she is enabling people to become seriously overweight and possible worse health problems. This woman adds fat, additives, and perservatives when there is not need at all. For example, she adds mayonnaise to store bought salad dressing, basically for no reason. But most of all, she is advocating that packaged foods are the way to go. That is simply not good. The human body is meant meant to take in the amounts of chemicals that are contained in her recipes. Check the labels; if you see chemicals, don't eat it! If you care about your health, you will stay clear of Sandra Lee."
positive,Zoot Suit Riot kix: Zoot Suit Riot is an awesome CD with high-energy tracks. It's great if you know how to swing. I love the Cherry Poppin' Daddies big band sound.
negative,"What a Disappointment!: The much-hyped, long awaited continuation of the saga of Ayla and Jondalar is finally here, and what a non-event it has turned out to be. The characters have turned to cardboard, the plot is plodding and, judging from the repetition and belabored descriptions, Auel must have been paid by the word for this mammoth disappointment. Auel's meticulous research and knowledge of the paleolithic era are, as always, superb--but that's not enough to elevate this potboiler to the level of her previous works.Since nothing happened or was resolved in this volume, there's sure to be another. I only hope Ms. Auel doesn't make us wait another ten years, and that she is able to capture the magic of her earlier work, so sadly lacking in Shelters of Stone."
positive,"Blow: Johnny Depp posesses an eclecticism and versatility so effortless that it's almost scary. His riveting turn as Cocaine Traffiker George Jung is one of many reasons to see this movie. The story of how he rises to the top of the drug game starting in the late 60's is told in a very clear, direct and colorful manner with great support from Ray Liotta, Paul Reubens, Franka Potente and Penelope Cruz. While the ending still seems a bit too cloying for me, nearly every frame leading up to the climax is American Cinema at it's best. Of Special Note: the costume design covering 3 decades of fashion, including the outlandish 70's is note perfect and easily adds to the texture and realism of the film without seeming cartoonish or flagrant. Give ""Blow"" a look, it's vastly entertaining."
negative,"Inaccurate: The outside temperature is roughly 5 degrees too low. This makes the unit pretty unusable in my opinion. I suspect that cheap components were used. A good temperature sensor chip can cost nearly $0.60 and they apparently didn't want to go there. Too bad- it's a nice looking unit, but what good is that if it doesn't measure temperature? Pretty ironic that the display shows tenths of degrees- what a joke."
negative,Amazon and its Discontents...: Looking for a review of the Legend Sherlock Holmes here? Well you might be able to find one here but only after searching for the Legend needle among the haystack of reviews of other DVD releases of the many companies issuing transfers of the Rathbone-Sherlock Holmes series. A big thumbs down to Amazon.com for this idiotic postmodernist posting of reviews policy. Bah humbug.
negative,He has a Decent Voice but He ain't no RUBEN!: first of all Clay Aiken has a decent Voice but make no mistake about it Ruben clearly was the Man Vocally of the two.Clay has this Safe run of the mill Material which He shouldn't be doing so soon.but then again considering what Rod Stewart has been doing with His Last two Projects then I think Clay should have done that instead.Rod needs these Songs&Clay needs to do what Rod is doing.nothing on here has Knock Out written on it.very Bland&dry.Clay deserves better than this.
negative,Railroad Hat: This hat does not appear to fit any adult I know. Very small. No time to return as needed it for a show. We altered it enough to use in the show.
negative,"A long magazine article: I wanted very much to like this book. I'm keenly interested in the affect media has on individuals and society and have read quite a lot in this area. Zengotita's breezy, intelligent and humorous style merely frustrated me. He presents mostly opinion, an extended essay. It is fascinating opinion, but not the sort of helpful fact-based analysis or data-driven synthesis I was hoping for. Perhaps if this is your first introduction to the field, the book would be enjoyable (though Neil Postman's ""Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business"" is for my money a great essay-like introduction to this field."
negative,"Not sure about veracity of the material: The author begins with the statement that she has probably spiced up the material a lot. Since, most of the author's story is around her sexual encounters, and she has stated that she has spiced up the material, it is not clear how much truth exist in this autobiography. Read it with a grain of salt. The book, however, does provide some interesting insight on the Saudi society."
negative,"Fresh Voices Needed!: After a decade, both Jean Auel and Robert Waller produced follow-ups to previous hits. I read both and wished I had not wasted my time nor money."
negative,"No cliche unturned: The cliche's:1. The supportive wise black friend,2. The overbearing to the point of unbelievable mother3. The hero is perfect, has higher ideals than Jesus4. When he goes into convulsions on the floor, I thought, here we go, he's dying of cancer, sure nuffWorst movie I've seen in a while, then again, I'm not female, nor under the age of 16."
positive,Acoustic fire- Something new: This album contains lots of new compositions that are great sounding. I love the use of acoustic instruments and unique vocals. It's great to here good easy listening original tracks. I hope this group keeps producing. What's the pickle all about?
positive,"Read this book, one of the best young adult fantasy books!!!: This books details the new wizard nita and her newfound friend kit on an adventure through time and worlds. Although this is an awesome book, and the second one is just as good, i found the third and fourth a tad on the dull side. Diane Duane, in my opinion, needs to introduce a few more lasting characters, instead of using the same exact people she began with and only a few new arrivals. You shoudl still read then, though, because they set your mind racing."
positive,"love it: I've been doing this (2) times a week, along with swimming a 1/2 mile at the public pool for the past 3 weeks and feel so good. This video really works your body in all the ways you need for strength and flexibility in surfing. I can't wait to get back in the ocean soon, when it gets a little warmer ! And take the power and flow of this yoga, to help me improve my surfing. Instead of working so hard to catch a wave and paddle out, at my age of 57:)"
positive,it was interesting because of the characters: For me it was very good to know about the soldiers who went to the war in VIETNAM. They know a lot about it because they were there for a long time.
negative,"Nothing works, no light no radio. What a waste.: This product is a waste of time. Out of the box and nothing worked. No lights, no radio. Now that I read the other reviews I see this is not uncommon. I will not perchase Totes products in the future."
positive,A very good show: I have been looking for this one for a while. I enjoy to watching it and it goes with my Lord of the Ring movie I have.
negative,"Disney Sells out: Well folks, I will not deal with the story. That is not what irritates me. First, the three disk set has two ""bland"" labeled DVDs. The third one looks like the play disk, but is a disk for Ipod or MS Media disk player. To make things more difficult, Disney wants some kind of input code number as if you were loading softwarwe. In my case the thing didn't work.Also, I am sooo sick and tired of Disney putting a ton of movies on DVD for sale at the beginning of their disks. Sure, it only takes about 8 clicks of the remote to get by them, but why should we have to do more than one click.I thought it was about time someone mentions these points."
positive,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Widescreen Edition) (Harry Potter 4): I would rate the service overall as excellent. The DVD arrive in excellent condition and within a few days of ordering. Was very please to receive a notification when the order was shipped and the tracking number.
negative,"not really the best: I read the many superlative reviews of this book and purchased it last month. I thought the people who wrote in that they couldn't finish the book were just being obnoxious. To my dismay, I would have to agree with them. Yes, the plot is fine, and the book is imaginative. The rival families/spice/Gesserit are somewhat interesting. But I had to put the book down 2/3 of the way through. It's just so boring, and convoluted, I couldn't take it. I found no pleasure in having to work through it. Anti-semitic? I doubt it. Bad grammar in spots? Yeah sure, but not a big deal.In short, a good book, but clearly not in the same league as J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings.""P.S. No one talks about this book...at all. Just wait until Tolkien's movies come out. See the difference for yourself."
negative,"Love the movie, but not on Blu-ray.: This review is not about the movie. The movie is Van Damme at his best and worst. Personally, one of my favorites. I ordered 3 Van Damme movies on blu-ray. Kick boxer, Cyborg and Double Impact. The other 2 looked like bllu-ray movies, but Double Impact on blu-ray proved to be a disappointment. The picture quality looked faded and colors dull. It made me cringe to watch the night scenes. If this movie was called ""The Fog"", I would be okay with it, but it's not. Maybe it's the production quality of the film itself. If you have the dvd, like I do, don't buy the blu-ray........ like I did."
positive,"Wanting Even More: Blind Faith left me wanting even more from the authors. But if I will get it in a movie, I'll enjoy it all the more. This was truly a sensational tale of one of pop's legends and the unbelievable struggles of his dear mother, Lula Hardaway. It took me less than two days to read this because I couldn't put it down. I hope Love and Brown team again with perhaps a part II or another autobiography."
positive,"Get the feel of Rome, not a tour guide.: As usual, before a trip to other country, I searched for a book that would give me a feel for the cities I visit, rather than a tour guide. This book excelled in this task and made my visit to Rome even fuller and more enjoyable. If you are looking for a book about Rome, its people, their habbits and a little glimpse into their rich history, this book is a rare find. The pace is calm, the subjects are simple, but the experience is great."
negative,"Horrible Movie!!!: I absolutely HATED this movie. It was SUCH a waste of my time. The first ten minutes made the movie seem worth watching, but then the storyline, along with my desire to watch it, fell dramatically after that. It was not worth my time! I couldn't wait for the credits to come. I found myself fast forwarding through parts, just to get through it quicker. I don't see what other people see in it. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you actually like being bored senseless."
negative,Boring with no climax: I thought this was the most boring movie I had ever seen. I fell asleep to it twice. It seemed to move at the pace of 2 miles per hour. I defintely do not recommend this film.
positive,Perfect for cloth diapering!: I purchased this and placed it on the wall in our laundry closet behind the dryer. It creates the perfect spot for drying of cloth diapers and wipes and I'm back to order a second! I wouldn't advise using it for heavy or large items though.
positive,"Blatant reality: This movie accurately portrays what city kids face day to day on the streets. I'm sorry if folks in Ohio cannot fathom such harshness of city life but this is how it is. I would know...a 17-year old teen growing up here in NYC. And I know who the virgin busters are, where to get the primo snuff, underground raves, rumbles, etc. Surprise surprise, KIDS is reality."
negative,"Worthless book: Be aware of bookstore reviews as the one before! About this book. After spending half the book about nothing - just descriptive and empty introduction, nothing hands on - exactly the type the beginner has no use for, the author writes examples that cannot be used. If you want to learn practical way (usable and meaningfull examples with hands on approach, what a beginner needs) this is not a book for you. It is certainly not for an expert either. Shortly - worthless. Add here bug full source from web site and you really have a headache. Learning curve - none, you won't learn anything, is that easy."
positive,"Good, not the best: When in doubt my daughter will aways eat sweet potatoes. These are good. Sweet potatoes and water. However, they are a little runny. I think they thin it out more than they should. But it is ok. Ella's is my favorite. They have a nice thick baby food. Earths best is my second favorite followed by Gerber."
positive,with XP: I haven't had any issues with this running on XP. I've had it for a year now and use it once a week to catch up with friends internationally. It's been great for me. It runs off a hub in my setup.
negative,"very disappointing: The description of JonBenet Ramsey case is very lengthy, detailed and so boooooring (already known from the media !)The ""psychic part"" of this chapter is short, just 2 pages. Short and disappointing, author writes: ""I don't claim to know who did it ...""That's it."
positive,"I'm 14, I love Spongebob, so there!!: ""The Spongebob Squarepants Movie"" had an unoriginal title, but I LOVED the movie anyway! I only liked two songs from it tho, ""Goofy Goober Rock"" and ""The Best Day Ever"". But overall, I recommend it for kids 9 yrs. old, to adult! This movie isn't a waste of time, or money, so buy it now! I also recommend this for anyone who loves Spongebob (and Patrick), who loves silly, but sometimes, twisted comedy, or someone who just wants to have a good time!"
positive,"Very basic, but quite useful for the mechanical engineers: Very basic, but quite useful for the mechanical engineers. It would be helpful, if you want to learn 'matlab' as a mechanical engineer."
negative,Very poor quality!: I wasn't very impressed with this antenna at all. Upon taking it out of the box the rubber cover that is supposed to be wrapped around the magnet mount fell on my garage floor. This thing is a cheap piece of junk. Save your money and your time and get the Little Wil. The rubber that is wrapped around the magnet is beyond cheap and the rest of the antenna is not very impressive either. Mine went back to Amazon.
positive,"Waiting To Take You Away: Where Pepper has been labeled a psychedelic album, MMT shows a more detailed picture of The Beatles foray in this genre. Where the British version was a two EP set(?)of the soundtrack music, the US version expanded it to an album that included the non-album singles from '67(Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane, All You Need Is Love/Baby, You're A Rich Man & Hello, Goodbye).The best songs from the film are the now standard Fool On The Hill, as well as the brilliant I Am The Walrus. Your Mother Should Know has a certain charm that even made the final scene in that terrible movie a welcome relief. Even for those who didn't see MMT(or who did and regrets it)the music in the end always conjures up a vivid picture of The Beatles psychedelic period."
positive,"Awesome Game: Saw this on a gadget site and decided to purchase it for my brother-in-law. He liked it a lot, and we had so much fun playing I bought myself one too. Very easy to pick up, and since practically no one has played it, everyone starts at the ability level. Similar to chess, only with freakin' laser beams, enough said."
negative,"Loved this Book when I was a child: I loved this book when I was a child. It was my favorite J.R.R. Tolkien story. My niece has inherited my love of books and I wanted her to experience it also, so I got the book for her birthday. I was so happy to find it in hardcover, I had to read it in paperback. Movies leave out too much these days so I try to to get her the books first. Too bad instead of getting it in the promised two day shipping, it was late. Almost every package I get these days, that are shipped FedEx Smartpost, is late. Her mother lives some distance away but she knew how excited I was to get Brooke the book that she drove an hour to pick it up. I just wish I could have seen her face when she got it. So much for Prime two day shipping."
positive,"Also useful if you live in Europe: You read a lot of books, when you have a relative with lung cancer. This book gives you an overview of the most common options you have, without the depressing statistics about lung cancer. If you fight for your health, statistics aren't that important after all.However, there are a lot of pages about coping with cancer 'socially', which may be important to some people, but that is information I was not really looking for. And the health system in de USA is a different from the system in Europe (dealing with doctors, insurance, that kind of things).But it is by far the best introduction book about lung cancer I have been reading so far. I keep using it over and over again. So: recommended, also if you live in Europe."
negative,"HORRIBLE!!: Only 2 1-star reviews and I don't totally agree w/ either one. WOW! I know a lot of hardcore metalheads love this album and are obsessed w/ it, BUT CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY?! ""Chop Suey"" has to be the most played out hard rock song that's on all the ""rock"" stations out there. I do enjoy listening to ""Prison Song"", matter of fact I love that one, but the rest doesn't do it for me. Why? System Of A Down have progressed. Try and compare ""Needles"" and ""Psycho"" to tracks like ""Sugar"" and ""War?"" from the 1st album. The heavy parts in these songs may be a bit heavier, but there are also mellow parts that turn me off."
negative,disapointed: I expected recipes and ...none!Made a donation to a senior center and donated ...Julie & Julia!!!!!!!!!!
negative,Really???: It's been nearly 3 weeks and it hasn't shipped yet. Are you guys printing it out a paragraph at a time and then sending it to a bindery?If it gets shipped tomorrow I still won't get it by the maximum arrival date of January 9th.
positive,"EXCELLENT: I found the Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour to be one of the best CD's that I have ever listened to. It has great hits such as Magical Mystery Tour, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, and All You Need Is Love. It also has some great songs that I never heard like Your Mother Should Know."
positive,"wow!: 1st of all,i'm no kid...i'm just lazy to register and stuff. anywayz,i first heard five pointe o on the resident evil soundtrack,with their song ""the infinity"". it just blew me away. then,i d/loaded ""king of the hill"" off the net...and i was even impressed. i rushed and bought the cd. do i regret it? HELL NO! five pointe o are here to stay. they are superb.forget slipknot,this band kicks...the shouts,the growls,the whispers...all blend in to make a wonderful record. somewhere along the way,slipknot forgot good music. don't get me wrong...slipknot's talented,especially corey taylor,the vocalist...but it just doesn't sound right. where slipknot failed,five pointe o has picked up. this young group offers so much more and seem more matured than slipknot and a lot of other groups out there. i really have high hopes for this band...seriously. plz ppl,juz take the time to listen to this album,you sure as hell ain't gonna regret it."
positive,"Clavell has done it again. His style expands into the 1900s: This is another fabulous work by James Clavell, a stand-out in his collection. Even though the book was set in a prison camp, all I thought about was that I wanted to be 'The King'. A rivetting story of life and death, friendship and betrayal. Shorter than his other works, but equally valuable."
positive,"Grow Rich While You Sleep: I liked this book because it not only tells about using your subconscious mind but it also goes into how to live a purposeful life. Together, both of the subjects help you to handle life a little better or at least understand your way through it."
negative,The worst design of a phone: I got this phone thinking that the name brand would stand for quality but it completely did not. The replacement cost me lots of shipping cost and did not even been to work. My advice it see this model do not buy unless you like pain and suffering with big cost for a truly inferior product. Clearly IBM does not care about their customer base. Their service after the sale is extremely bad. Their design on this phone was so poor that the phone only almost worked for 1 day.
negative,"Good CD completely ruined by copy-protection: Despite the fact I sampled and enjoyed most of the music on this CD at a local store, I will not be purchasing this or any CD implementing Sony's latest generation of copy-protection. Preventing people who purchase this album from making legal backups or copies for their own personal use on MP3 players is a completely unacceptable practice, and should be stopped.Furthermore, the software installed by this CD cloaks its presence on your computer, disguises itself as something else in case the average user stumbles onto references to it, and has the potential to damage computers if not removed properly (which isn't as easy as going to Add/Remove programs, as it is not listed there).For more information on this new, malicious form of copy-protection, I suggest googling ""sony+DRM+rootkit""."
positive,"A show stopper: Fitzgerald brought down the house with this brilliant recording of a 1960 performance. I normally am not a big fan of my parents' era of music, but she is one of the most amazing singers I have ever heard. Her vocal range, intonation, phrasing and ability to scat sing are all astounding. She could teach a lot of today's divas (Mariah, Celine, Whitney, etc.) a thing or two. This album would be a perfect introduction to Ella Fitzgerald -- I see now why people call her the ""First Lady of Song."""
positive,"Great quality, small New Testament and Psalms and Proverbs: The font is good sized. The quality is great. It fits in my back pocket, though it often reaches the top of the pocket (meaning, it's often almost as tall as the pocket).Good!"
positive,"A LOT OF FUN, BUT THE SEAT?: I RECEIVED THIS TOY AS A GIFT & MY 11 MONTH OLD SON LOVES THE LIGHTS & MUSIC. IT HAS DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT SETTINGS AND THE MUSIC SELECTIONS ARE GREAT. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT THE SEAT IS PRETTY MUCH JUST A SQUARE BLOCK. NOT THE BEST FOR A BABY THAT TENDS TO LEAN OVER. THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE THIS WITH A NICE BUCKET TYPE SEAT OR AT LEAST WITH A BACK OF SOME SORT. ALL IN ALL I AM HAPPY WITH IT BECAUSE IT HOLDS MY SON'S ATTENTION AND IT IS REALLY A CUTE TOY. I WOULD RECOMMEND BUYING IT."
positive,"Pocket sized ESV...: I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this little bible. I have no issues with it whatsoever. It serves its purpose, and it is with me everywhere I go. Best 10 bucks you'll ever spend."
negative,Why hasn't this been released free of DRM yet?: C'mon kids. Get a grip on reality. Drm won't sell. Never ever will DRM sell. Let go already.
negative,"David's thoughts: The stranger is about a man who has no emotion and is indifferent to the world. In the beginning, the man's mother dies, and he doesn't show any feelings. Next, he meets a girl but won't tell her that he loves her. Later, the man kills an Arab on a beach and is put in prison. While in his trial the man is bored and is eventually sentenced to have his head cut off. While waiting for his execution, he tells the chaplain that he doesn't believe in God and never will. The book ends with him in prison, waiting hopelessly for his execution.I did not particularly like this book. It is boring to read a book when the character has no emotion. I also thought that there wasn't enough action and that the ending was pointless."
positive,"Wonderful, strong pistol case: I bought two of these. One for a .32 S&W and the other for a Taurus PT-92 AF 9mm. They both fit nicely with room to spare for extra clips and such. Sturdy design and a snug fit. All around, you can't beat this case for the price."
positive,ahi: I am 116 lbs. but after 4 kids (a set of twins) the tummy was not the same. squeem gives me a beautiful shape under my clothes...never look better. the only downfall it does not cut inches off or make you loose any body fat..after its off all the bulge comes out. It makes you look great thou...don't leave home without it.
positive,very happy: If this air filter was used it was not for very long. It was in its orignal box and plastic bag it also had a k&n sticker. I am very happy with my purchase I paid 40$ for a 68$ filter. And shipping was fast.
negative,"ARRRRRRRGH: I forced myself through this because someone told me it would be good. Every day I read this I expected to be blown away. Alas, I was disappointed. After several hundred pages of unoriginal dribble and disgusting incest, I finally came up for air. About every three lines in this book I felt like having an aneurism. The ""magical realism"" crap that everyone rants lovingly about in this book is a load of garbage. No, it's not creative. It's boring and annoying. The author randomly throws supernatural phenomena into the story at random points and doesn't have enough originality or creativity to explain it or make it interesting; he just moves on. No, sorry, I won't explain why this person is psychic. Oops, this person just snapped. Sorry. Hey, whaddya know! It's raining flowers. Oh why not I'll throw in some ghosts... maybe some magical gypsies... and we've got an inane bore-fest. Useless."
positive,"Keith Jarrett: This album is in a very different field from his amazing, brilliant, and deeply inspired Koln Concert and Arbour Zena. It is good in its own manner, toned down and of a very different nature."
negative,"Battlefield Lagnam: Craptacular junk is what this ""game"" is. I know because this is just the same crap as the original Battlefield 1942/Lagnam. Heck, they didn't even bother to hide it. Just sneak into the enemy's control point, capture it while they're fighting somewhere else, and hope that they won't do the same thing. Do bunny jumping during infantry battles, use the vehicles to run over people.IF you get to play it. I have played this piece of junk on a university campus's computer, which has about 23-24 times faster than the average internet connection, but could not get a ping lower than 700.Maybe this game will be popular in 4-5 years when the crappiest internet connection will have a light-like speed, and people will be able to make battles with 64 playes and no lag.But until then, skip it."
negative,Am I missing something?: What is so special about this book? I am a baby boomer that has always respected the sacrifices that the WWII generation had to endure both oversees and at home. Do I need Tom Brokaw to reinforce this? Please! I stopped about half way through; to me it was 200 pages of senior citizen complaints about the younger generations.
positive,"Great looks: The product looks great, but it appears it design will not hold heavy weights for a constant period of time. I found the chairs easy to put together, if you follow the directions and have the proper tools. I only plan to use the chairs for a short period of time and I recommend that if you plan to use the product(s) for more than two or three years buy another product. However, The table that I purchased with the aforementioned product looks great and appears it will last five or more years with the proper care."
negative,"A lack of communion: Having read and tremendously enjoyed both The Club Dumas and The Flanders Panel by Reverte, I looked forward to another labrythine and intellectual tale. I was highly disappointed. The plot, or lack of one, is bad enough. Then, I could not decide if Reverte wanted to present a philosophical treatise or a mildly comic novel (clearly, he missed both points, if he was even aiming at them!). I will now approach his books with far more caution than I would have previously. If you enjoyed the two I mentioned above, save your time and money on this one."
positive,"Not Bad At All: Althought I enjoyed Usher's album ""My Way"" more, this one wasn't too bad. I like the first 4 songs and then another one towards the end of the album. I think Usher has a really nice voice...great dancer too and I look forward to hearing more from him."
positive,"Wonderful developmental toy: Our 9 month old son got this toy for Christmas. He first crawled behind it with one hand on each leg of the toy. Then he started to try to stand up, but it only worked very good on the carpeting. We parents were supervising closely to teach him to stand more upright when pushing the toy, which helps to control the speed. We spent many hours going back and forth with him crawling, then walking behind this before he got the hang of it. Now that he is almost a year old, he will stop when he runs into so mething, crawl over one of the legs and push the toy backwards, then re-mount and keep going. He can handle the speed, even on slick floors. He also likes to play with the balls, and can find them when they go into the basket. The jazzy music is pretty cool, but definitely motion sensitive!!!"
positive,"this album is nice...: Ghostface's new album isn't as good as Supreme Clientele, but it definitely is a hot CD...the last track with musiq called 'love' is nice, and obviously ghost and jada's ""RUN!"" is sick...there's only 1 song i truly hate on the CD and its the one with a beat with a telephone ringing, it just gets on my nerves...otherwise in my opinion its a pretty hot CD, but not as good as some of Ghost's other albums.."
positive,"Truly Awesome: I have been a Yes fan for about 30 years and I must say this is one of the best pieces of music I've heard. With today's technology, everything is so crisp and very refined. This is one box set every true yes fan should own. It may be a little pricey to some, but I must say....it's well worth the money.The book that comes with the five c.d. set just adds to the flavor. Having been seperated from Yes music for a while, when my fiancee gave this to me as a Christmas gift I was very pleased. Once I heard it....well let me say this, it actually brought tears to my eyes,as well as a lot of memories. This is a must have for the true Yes fan. I got the fever and found websites of all the members and the website of Yes World. Yes fans.....you have got to get this."
positive,Whitney Design 2134 Chrome Revolving 4-tier shoe tree: What a wonderful product. Very sturdy and easy to assemble. We keep it in the garage and each child has a tier for their shoes. They place their shoes on the tree before entering the house. Helps keep floors clean from clutter.
positive,"Brilliant: This book finally reveals the Samaritans in their own words, an important and worthwhile endeavor. For a long time this was a people that was forgotten, like the Armenians. However in the 2-5th centuries A.D they made up half or more of the population of the Holy Land. A semi-Jewish people practicing a form of Judaism lived and worshipped in these centuries until they were destroying in a series of rebellions against Christian Byzantium and perseucted under Absassid Islam. A fascinating religion and people, these importatn texts explain their way of life and traditions and keep them with us.Seth J. Frantzman"
positive,"Some great and some not so!: I rarely by a cd just for one song but I did on this one I bought it just for My Rifle Pony and Me from Rio Bravo. I always liked that song but was never able to locate it. I am happy to report that there are several other good cuts on this cd. Of the 26 songs I can say that about half of them are pretty good and easy to listen to while there is only 6 or 7 duds. You can just skip Lorne Green, Tab Hunter and Kirk Douglas they can't sing and it is too bad that they were included on this disc.If you are a fan of westerns, movies or tv, you will no doubt enjoy most of this. The quality of the recording is fine though it is from Germany and some of the details in the written material is in German to me its not really a problem."
negative,B70 Dead: I have used the B70 for about 11 months and its now as useful as a rock. It turns on but will not dispense or suck up the water properly. Any machine that fails in 11 months is completely useless in my book. Especially a coffee machine that is sold for $160. Hopefully its not a hassle to get a replacement. I'm lucky it failed under warranty.
positive,swingin!: this cd is great!! the fact that it is live brings it a life that the studio recordings lack- keely smith is fantastic!
positive,"An outstanding series: The Air TV series is one of the greatest drama's I have ever seen.To say the character design, art, and story are memorable is an extreme understatement.The inclusion of the OVA episodes makes this an incredible value.As with all things, I strongly recommend watching it in it's original language (Japanese in this case)with English subtitles so that you can experience it the way the director intended.Overall: I strongly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys dramas"
negative,"I Didn't Have High Expectations, But Honestly!: Now, this movie seemed right up my alley. I was looking for a blockbuster, throwaway popcorn flick. Bang Bang Shoot-Em Up. I liked the Fast and the Furious, and Vin Diesel without a shirt was worth my ticket price alone, that's the two stars. But frankly, this was BORING. VERY VERY BORING. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, if the poison has to mix first, just tell em it's been launched and blow the thing out of the water before it's mixed. Crimony didn't they just SAY that it became harmless? It's just stupid. Vin Diesel DID have some good dialogue, the script wasn't that bad, but this movie, to put it simply, is BORING."
positive,"I love this thing!: I love this toy! I have been playing on neopets for months and months and when I saw that my cousin had a different one of these things, I went and bought this thing. It is so fun! You have to feed it and play with it and play the 4 games to earn NPs (neopoints, sort of like money) to buy it stuff. You get even get a rare item code to use on the site! The only thing I don't like about it is that if you drop it, 85% of the time it will reset itself and you have to start all over again if you don't have a screwdriver with you and pop the batteries back into place in less than a minute. I have done that 4 times! So you have to be careful."
negative,"Could be better: As a first time nursing mother, I found this book repetitive and the layout confusing, with many ""refer to this section and that section"" references (without page numbers) and little help. Some of the information is out of date. I recommend Jack Newman's ""Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers"" as the absolute best source for a new mom."
positive,just what I needed: I got this to wear under my Death Skull Bone Airsoft Full Face Protection Safety Mask. makes wearing a mask more comfortable than being on bare skin.
negative,"Where is the music from the film that I bought this cd for?: I enjoyed the film and purchased the cd in search of the Zydeco song ""Your going to Hell"" but alas although it was the most pumping song in the whole film they left it off the sound track! Does anyone know the name of the song that I'm talking about and where can I find it?"
negative,"not Sanders butterscotch: This is not Sanders butterscotch... it is Caramel.Sanders had a classic butterscotch that was featured on a cake, cupcakes and other confectionery delights."
positive,batman begins: i loved it this is the best batman since batman its a movie i watched 5 times in a row and cant wait to buy it if you havent seen the new batman begins its a must see for all
positive,"To The Stars: I can't get enough of this CD. I play it every day, many times a day. I hear the next single will be ""The Way"" with ""Solitaire"" on the B-side, both perfect choices. Clay's voice gets more unbelievably beautiful every time I hear him. I was worried about this CD catering more to what passes for popular music today, but, thankfully every track is a gem and remains true to Clay himself and his fans. My favorites are No More Sad Song, The Way, I Will Carry You, Run to Me, but it's really hard to pick favorites because they are all so good. I simply cannot wait for a brand new full CD of Clay. He and his voice are a winner in every sense of the word...and don't forget he just won American Music Award's Fans' Choice and a Billboard award for his single, This is the Night/Bridge Over Troubled Waters. As Diane Sawyer said, ""He's on a rocket to the stars!"""
positive,"What a great experiment!: The Brass Fantasy was a wonderful group that Lester Bowie led--kind of a late 20th century interpretation of the New Orleans brass band, but playing the music of the day. It's a real kick in the pants to hear some of the pop tunes as they are interpreted here. The tuba player rocks! Forget the oom-pah! My favorite is their interpretation of that jukebox favorite, Crazy. This is a great album for someone with a fairly open mind and a good sense of humor."
positive,"Cool Fast and Fun What more could you want?: Rush two is a great improvment on the first rush. With the ability to adjust each of the 12+ cars color,handling,engine sound,and mags this game has it all. It also has a great sound track to go along with it's well designed tracks. Two player action is great and the stunt course provides hours of fun. Of all the racing games for the 64 this has to be one of the better ones money well spent!"
negative,"Not as good as the book: I know you can't take a book as long as this one and include every single scene.But, they could have at least tried to make some attempt to preserve what was so good about the book in the first place.The story in the book is much more complicated and interesting than in the movie. It's as if they took an orange, scooped out all the pulp, poured in water, high fructose corn syrup and artificial orange flavour and said, here you go, here's an orange.They made too many cuts to the story that didn't add to the plot and added things that weren't in the book that did nothing to move the story along.Too many unnessasary changes just makes for a messy movie which is confusing to all who haven't read the book.I say, just skip this movie. It's good in terms of visuals, but when it comes to standing up to the book, it fails."
positive,fun aquarium: I bought this for my third baby. Two babies later it still works. The kids still like to push it and watch the fish go round and round and the bubbles. It is a great baby toy.
positive,"Every song a delight. Treasure this CD!: This CD has outstanding renditions of love songs, sung with feeling and style that only Shirley Horn can sing."
negative,"A book of cliches: Firts of all, i dont know why this book had a chance of being one of the top sellers. Every aspect of this book is an obvious rip off of fantasy based genres. If you happen to be new to this kind of ""ideas"", it would be a quite interesting book to read. But of course, in order to enjoy it, you MUST ignore the mediocre dialogue that doesnt seem to fit the whole dragon-king-castle era. By that i mean, what kind of medieval-old-wise man would talk like a 21st century suburban teen? And then start talking in a somewhat shakespearian speech that sounds more like David-Spade-trying-sound-like-yoda-from-starwars? But then again, its good book for novices but if your pass that...well..you'll see my point."
negative,"Avoid it!!: This clasic and marvellous twisted show is one of the funniest things I've ever watched on TV, and the only worth thing watching in that ridiculous and obnoxious channel called MTV. But to release it for this price and containing only 45 (that's it: only 45 minutes!!)it's a shame, and aggression, it's simply not worth it. Maybe someday they will make it right: a box with all the seasons for a fair and reasonable price."
positive,"Fear is the Mind Killer: This is one of the finest works of science fiction ever crafted, containing some of the most memorable phrases ever invented. I will leave it to the reader to enjoy the litany that includes the famous phrase, ""Fear is the Mind Killer.""Herbert successfully weaves an epic tale of rebellion and religion. It is the tale of a man who becomes a messiah, and discovers many things about himself, the Empire he lives in, and the world of Dune.Herbert paints a world in which man can travel between stars, yet no longer uses computers; a place where fencing skills are often more useful than energy weapons; a land of soldiers, assassins, prophets, mystics, nobles, monsters. It is about love, passion, resistance--and the effect that the appearance of a messiah has on a culture.Sadly, much of Herbert's sequels don't live up to this first book. However, it is an entirely satisfying epic in its own right--if you never read the other books, this one will still live on in your memory forever."
negative,Lonesome Crow: This album was released in 1972 only Germany.Klaus Meine and Michael Schenker had just joined his brother Rudolf's band that he had formed in 1965.The album was rereleased in 1983.A rare find in original form with an awsum picture on the front and back The album was also recorded on clear vinyl.The music is definatly scorpions rock however it is primative .
positive,"Investigating basics: This book is a good start for someone who is interested in the paranormal and would like to try some of the techniques that investigators use to capture evidence of unexplained activity. There is helpful information on forming an investigative group and lists equipment that someone might wish to purchase. Richard Southall does a good job of describing how to use each piece of equipment to gather evidence. He does also express his theories on the paranormal, and it is interesting to listen to his point of view. I think this is a good start, but seasoned investigators are not likely to learn anything new."
positive,"The writings of a genius.: After I bought this book, I started to read it and could not put it down. I read the entire thing in two days! Michiu Kaku has become one of my favorite authors because of this book and I currently have almost all of his books. All I can say is that he is a genius plain and simple. I have to reread pages of information before I can grasp the details of these concepts, it is excellent writing. Excellent!!"
negative,IT doesn't even work: I opened the box and plugged it in. I put a pencil in the opening. All it does is making a buzzing sound. How bad it is to receive a defective one. It looks like this has been returned before.
positive,"Battle 360 - What a great history lesson.: I enjoyed this history of the Enterprise aircraft carrier so much I bought a copy for my dad. I'm sorry to say I did not know all this ship did for our great country in WWII. These types of lessons should be taught in the school system but sadly this and many other WWII history lessons of the great United States are not. I recommend this to everybody, young and old. It is a complete history of the Enterprise and her courageous men fighting the Japanese. The graphics are great and they explain each battle in easy to understand detail."
positive,Classic: Great story and a very easy read. I would recommend The Hobbit to anyone with a sense of adventure an love of an underdog success story.
positive,"Transition: After waiting 11 years, I was thrilled and disappointed. Thrilled to finally have book 5 here. Disappointed, as not much happened. There isn't the ""drama"" to this volume that appeared in earlier. No threats to Jondalar and Ayla's relationship, no threats to their lives, no real cultural problems or fitting in problems. What I do see is Jean setting the scene for the next volume.We will see the resolution of Ayla becomming Zelandoni, there will be some interaction with the clan, and Ayla did make some enemies. I expect to see more drama with them in book 6.All in all, an enjoyable, light read."
negative,"You'd have o be chained to the couch to watch this movie!: Undeservedly overlooked at this year's Oscars, this is actually a retitling of a film called 'Hell Mountain', and has all the hallmarks of a tedious cash-in. You'd be half right; while nothing to do with the 1983 classic, as post-apocalyptic soft-porn B-movies go, it's not at all bad. And, believe me, I've seen enough to know how bad it *can* get. Fortunately, CH3 is set in a future where fertiliser and guns are in short-supply, but civilization still has an abundant supply of thongs and hair-stylists. The plot/excuse has a village exchanging their nubile young girls with an evil (and disfigured, natch) man who runs the fertiliser mine. This peeves one of the boyfriends, who looks like Kyle McLachlan, but sadly possesses none of the quirky wit. Oh, and all teachers bar one have been exterminated."
negative,Worst Toy Ever: this toy is just horible. it dosn't even do anything. what is the world coming to? the best thing you can do with it is to play fetch with your dog.(sticks are much cheaper though....they are actaully free!)well you can't even do magic with them.
negative,3D effects leave a lot to be desired: Movie was fair. Not as good as the others. The 3D effects are few and weak.
positive,"Solid Solo Debut: Fresh out of Miles Davis' electric menagerie, Keith Jarrett recorded FACING YOU, his first solo piano album, in Norway in the fall of 1971. While less awe-inspiring than later works like THE KOLN CONCERT, it's a strong and wide-ranging collection of mostly rhapsodic original pieces which wander through the musical landscape in the master keyboardist's already-distinctive style and sensibility. Well worth checking out if you're curious; this man doesn't fake it."
negative,"Boring,,,: Mckellen does such a poor job in this movie..ofcourse it is easy to act gay when you are in real life..Brendan Fraser is the only decent actor in the entire movie and to think that he was in Encino Man..."
negative,"Biggest hoax of all time!: This is a hoax! This book was not written by a fifteen year old boy! There are things about writing a good book that take years to get just right that no teenager would know. Plus, Christopher's father just happened to be in the publishing business, which tells me that he is the one that wrote it.I'm sure Christopher is old enough now to write his own books, so go ahead and read the later editions with confidence! Until then, try reading Adventures With Boys 5 Dragons Versus Dinosaurs!"
negative,"The Movie That Spawned An NHL Franchise: Leave it to Disney to captilize on the name of one of their kid's flicks. Well, it was good for what it was. I wouldn't watch it again though, it wasn't as memorable as ""The Sandlot"" or ""Goonies"" but it'll do."
positive,"Entertaining, not necessarily educational: I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" - I thought it was fast-paced and interesting, I enjoyed the plot line and the characters, and I like Gregory's writing style. That being said - I liked this book for its entertainment value, not for its historical accuracy. While it's not that the book is wildly inaccurate, its also just not the most reliable fiction book out there in terms of what happened to Anne Boleyn and what kind of person Mary Boleyn was. Read this book if you want something to entertain, interest and amuse you, if you want to learn about Henry VIII and his court, read Alison Weir."
negative,"Not a Wonder for us: This is a very attractive toy. The ocean sounds are so realistic you feel as if you were on the beach. That is my impression. My grandson (10 months) however has a different view.For the first day or so after the toy arrived he would pick the balls up and hold them in his hands while trying to get the little items inside to spin around. However, they would only spin once or twice and stop. He would push the bowl around and listen to the ocean sound for a bit but it was too heavy for him to get it to make the splashing sound. I had to jiggle the bowl in order for him to hear that. He never quite got the ""dropping the balls in the bowl"" part. He would drop them in and nothing, to him anyway, would happen so that ended pretty quick.He hasn't played with it since that first day or two after it arrived.I would not recommend this product unless you are looking for a nice item to put on your child's shelf."
positive,"Simply The Best: In the world of shampoo's I must have triedevery one of them and spent much money, eachtime hoping I would see the results that werepromised. Then I found this product. My hairresponded immediately. It is now lookingbetter than it has in years. I am not ayoung woman any more, but still take pride inmyself. I have to say this is simply the bestshampoo product on the market today - bar none."
negative,"Poor and rather too lowbrow for it's own good.: Lowbrow and pretty stupid horror movie that lacks screenplay to not only explains what is going on but a lead actor who can act. Keanu Reeves is the gapping hole that sinks this ship and his performance will be remembered as one of the worse performances ever in a major motion picture. It also does not help the film that the director does not know how to shot a scene and the special effects are bottom of the barrel for a movie of this kind. Rachel Weisz is great but she's the only actor who seems like she gives a damn about her performance While the rest seem like they are sleepwalking.If you love to look at your watch for two hours waiting for this movie to end, be my guess. If you want to save your dignity and your eyes, skip this film."
positive,"Handy fishing companion: Fits in my pocket when I go fishing - I read a bit after I cast the line. Best days of my life are with a trout stream, rod and this book."
negative,"vague and repititious: I can't understand all the fuss about this book. It was vague, wordy, ambiguous, contradictory, and or no practical help.We are told to ""anchor our longings"" but never told how or what exactly he means by this. I can literaly open any page of this book and wonder what on earth he is talking about because he never gives examples or practical steps. Example: ""The visitor is one who belongs somewhere else, but is now here in the world of your belonging."" Read on in the paragraph and you get more of the same.I stayed with it to the end assuming that he would surely explain some fundamental truth that we can apply to our lives. He didn't."
negative,"What was John Carpenter thinking?: This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. It gets one star because of the footage from the first ""Halloween"". The acting sucked. The plot sucked. The whole movie was a waist of time and money. Avoid this movie at all costs!"
negative,"Please try another Hot Boy album...: Guerriula Warfare is an album I fell is something, and that something is everything. The lyrics are most of the time meanless and pointless. Also the beat and backround music of the songs sometimes don't even fit could for the lyrics or how the rapper is rapping. Overall please go out and get another Hotboy album or something. Or just another album in the lines of Cash Money, just please not this one..."
positive,"Relics of the classic age: MGM had great stars like Judy Garland. They had great music writers like the Gershwin brothers and others. They had great silky black and white photography, sharp as any DVD without the color. What they didn't have was great plots. These movies were little throwaways, a Saturday afternoon's entertainment meant to be changed every week. Babes on Broadway starts pretty well, and ends with a hideous blackface routine that is supposed to ""make"" the team of kids on Broadway. Times have changed."
positive,"It's a gas cap: Well, it's a gas cap. I would say it keeps gas from spilling out of the tank, but there's already a valve that keeps that from happening. Again, it's a GAS CAP. It screws on comfortably and is easy to screw off (hehe...I put 'screw off' in this). I would've given it four stars, but that fifth star is earned when it screws itself on and off and puts gas in the car for me."
negative,"Yuck, hate the use of Julia Child's good name...: Julia was right to hate the use of her name by others, Julie Powell is the exact opposite of what Julia was."
positive,"love it!: We love it! My kids enjoyed watching the classic Christmas movies. My wife and I enjoyed sharing our childhood times watching these movies. Very fast shipping!thanks,Russ"
positive,"Good movie: I liked this movie. It has good character development, doesn't rely on special effects and was generally entertaining and thoughtful."
negative,"Poor quality and design: Very poor quality for a premium price. The sound quality is poor. There is a distinct background hiss on all channels. The battery doesn't keep a charge very long, and there is no mute key (an absolute must for a speaker phone)."
positive,"Great book: This book is a classic. I would recommend it to long-time Christians as well as new Christians or those wanting to explore the basic components of the Christian faith.Lewis is humble, positive and writes a hopeful and uplifting book. There are a few comments that show some biases of the time in which it was written, but looking at the big picture this book is excellent.Of course, there will always be those who criticize the logic of Lewis' book and I just do not understand the obsession with trying to prove to people of faith that they are wrong, unenlightened, uninformed. On the contrary, I think Lewis book shows that Christianity is not for blind followers but for people who are ready to be challenged each day."
positive,"High Tide by Helen Dortch Longstreet: THE CRITICS HAVE IT ALL WRONG AS USUAL.There are many critics who have poo-pooed this work as just another book by a desperate wife trying to save (or restore) the slandered reputation of her husband, General James Longstreet.After the civil war, a cadre of unscrupulous low-level Confederate generals attacked the reputation of Gen. Longtreet in a effort to mask their own questionable civil war records or to enhance their own current reputations and that of Gen. Robert E. Lee. This book was Helen Longstreet's response to that attack.Keep in mind that at age 17, Helen Dortch was editoress of the Carnesville Tribune newspaper, in Carnesville, Georgia. As a newpaperwoman, she possessed all the investigative and writing skills necessary to cull facts from fiction. This is an excellent book in defense of her husband's reputation and was based on the Official Records. Unlike many others, she quoted from historical, not hysterical, facts."
positive,"funny girl: I purchased this as a gift, but assume that it was satisfactory as I have not heard otherwise."
negative,"leaked!: These pampers leaked, one out of five times.Makes changing them much harder.I do not recomend this product to anyone."
positive,"Wonderful, wonderful book: I haven't read many biographies since I was in elementary school, but I suspect that even if I'd read hundreds, this would still rank as one of my favorites. Absolutely riveting, and it gave me a much greater appreciation and admiration for Van Gogh himself, his difficult life, his work, and his wonderfully indulgent brother, Theo. Highly recommended if you have the slightest interest in art and Van Gogh in particular."
negative,Quit working within two weeks: We bought this based on Keurig reputation. It quit working within two weeks after only a few uses. It quit puncturing the seal on the single-use cups so the water poured around the cup instead of into it. We returned it to the store and received a refund. The clerk said he had worked in Returns Dept. for five years and they were seeing more returns on this product than any other he had experienced; they were averaging three returns per week in that store alone (chain has over 500 stores). He then pointed to their returns basket where another sat stating it had been returned only minutes before we returned ours. Let the buyer beware.
negative,"Don't Believe the Hype: This movie gets one star because for all its hype and awards this movie was boring. The story was not all that interesting, the music was even less interesting. I don't what type of singing it is that Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson sing, but it has no melody and follows no beat, I would call commercial gospel. Nevertheless, it's a real turnoff and does not do any justice to the great music produced by Motown. Beyonce is just horrible and a fake. Can she ever make you believe she is playing anyone else but herself? Yeah, compared to her, Jennifer Hudson does seem like an academy award actress. Hudson has potential but isn't quite there yet. The accolades and awards where a little premature. I am not sure what criteria was applied to this movie to make everyone think it was so good, but it's not. Save your money and buy the Supremes Greatest Hits."
negative,"Stops working, keurig will not repair do not buy: Stops working then the company will not help, I have tried. They will not repair so do not buy. This product make great coffee for a short time until it breaks."
negative,"Can&#65533;t fight the moonlight&#65533;: Okay, I'm a sucker for John Goodman, and he's by far the sexiest in the cast. I'll admit that I enjoyed the movie mainly because (a) I did not actually pay for the rental, and (b) I was consuming large amounts of alcohol at the time. To the film's credit, even in my drunken stupor I could tell that the scenes in which Piper pretends to sing were incredibly corny. I think I remember falling off the sofa and landing on my head from the extreme cheese-ness. You know? The kind that makes your skin crawl?In true Bruckheimer form, Leanne Rimes organizes a high-speed train robbery which results in a spectacular car wreck involving two commercial airliners and the Seattle Space Needle... but I don't want to spoil it for anybody. See it for yourself (read: do not see this for yourself). Two stars."
negative,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!: This was just awful!! I wasted 20 bucks on this. More swearing than any normal person, the main character is an idiot!!! ""Why does naked girl like that guy and not me?"" Dude maybe because he saved her and you did nothing. This Anime has a real bad budget as well. Just awful!!! Get anything else but this!!!! Good concept, Bad anime...."
negative,"I Returned This Book: This book was useless to me because it states the obvious, for example, ""Avoid calling your child names such as fatty."""
positive,"Never has there been such a good book!: Enter 1 Hobbit and 13 dwarfs + 1 aged wizard and you get an wonderful adventure! If you are like me and watched the movie before reading the book then you will be pleasantly surprised on the number of times the script matches this book. J.R.R. Tolkien is brilliant with words, he sets the scene so amazingly in words that you can visualise it as you read.Highly recommend to almost anyone, although if you are not used to the genre then you may find it a little odd."
positive,This movie stands alone!: First Rate in 1971 and First Rate in 2007. This movie brilliantly deals with one of the deepest riddles that plagues mankind. Namely Man himself. Timeless.
positive,"Interesting performance: I bought this only because as a fan, I want all of their material. First off, you'll notice the disc length of 76.46. The band added a keyboard player Graham Maitland for this tour which at first is a bit hard to digest(mixed too far up front)sometimes the keyboards work, other times not. There are some classics here- 'The king will come', 'Persephone', 'Time Was' as well as a few others. Sound quality is average, sounds like a straight transfer with no doctoring with the sound. This is the Mark 2 lineup with Laurie Wisefield. Not one of the best concert offerings by the band but worthwhile. I'm sure the band has some real gems in their archive like the live tracks on the superb 'Distillation' box set. Sadly they are not contained on this disc. If you can get past the keyboards and the muddy sound quality, you may enjoy it. Somehow I feel only the true fans will want this disc in their collection."
negative,"Smells TOXIC and awful: This smells like paint thinner or something. It does NOT go away with washing or airing or anything else, and is so strong my entire ROOM smells like a chemical factory. Aside from the fact that it is a total buzz-kill to have this awful stink, I have no idea if it is save. Who knows what's in/on this thing and I certainly wouldn't want to put it in my body...it could be leaching chemicals. Cancer comes to mind. I had to throw it away. Total waste. Don't buy it, find another supplier!"
negative,"Poor quality for the money: For the cost, this puzzle is not well made. The pieces were locked together so firmly that the puzzle was very difficult to get apart. The edges had visible splinters, and over the course of a few days, the tray warped to the point that it doesn't sit flat on a table. The edges of the image on the pieces began to fray immediately as the puzzle was taken apart. To make the puzzle usable, I had to spend 15 minutes sanding the interlocking edges, placing a slight bevel on the bottom of each piece. I then rubbed a white crayon on each edge surface. This made the puzzle easy to work for my 2 year old grand daughter. On the plus side, the image is bright and colorful, and the puzzle is simple enough for a toddler to work. Considering that the puzzle is made in China and probably cost next to nothing to produce, they could have spent a few minutes finishing the edges of the pieces and lacquering the image so that it is more durable."
negative,Not a Huge Fan: Monique was a bit to much. Didnt really enjoy her on the mic. Loved Paul Mooney piece it was way to short. And the last comedian Corey was funny. But I wouldnt recommend anyone else to buy it. If your buying it to hear Paul Mooney's Piece your better off waiting until his new stand comes out next month. Monique ruined the DVD.
negative,"Seventh Cavalry, Starring Randolph Scott: I have today Wednesday 7th. March 2012 received the dvd Seventh Cavalry Starring Randolph Scott from Amazon.com, it is distributed by Desert Island Films, I cannot say a good thing about it, the picture is very poor, the sound is poor and I am returning it at once."
positive,"80's High Tech with Rock Emotion: Although all of Mr Hines work is high quality, Waving Not Drowning (for me) is the highlight of the 3 A&M projects. The song ""Curious Kind"" is simply a masterpiece!The remastering is of the quality you have come to expect from one of Rock's greatest producers, song writers, and performers.GET IT!"
positive,"The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition): The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition) is a great adventure movie that is a bit like the Indiana Jones movies but with a mummy. Acting and plot are ok but one sees this movie for the action scenes and the special effects. The music is quite good also. This movie is nothing like Mummy with Boris Karloff and if one expects it to be the same then one will be sorely disapointed. However, if one comes in and expects a thin action driven plot with plenty of special effects then this is a dandy of a movie. 4/5."
positive,"Kamelot's best yet.: Wow, what a long way this band has come since ""Eternity"". Roy Khan's smooth prog metal vocals match this band a great deal better than Vanderbilt's vox did. Instead of sounding like a poor man's Queensryche they now sound like a metal act on par with the likes of Savatage, Symphony X, and Blind Guardian. Khan's vocals dominate this album, but that doesn't mean that Youngblood's mighty guitars should be ignored. He manages to combine great talent for rhythym with an amazing ear for leads and solos. By this point he's actually surpassed Michael Romeo of Symphony X as a songwriter (sorry Mike). However, what makes this album a true triumph is the presence of so many great guest musicians, particularly the collection of Keyboardists and guest vocalists that add to the overall sound a great deal. This is one of the best arranged albums of 2003. A must buy for any fan of Prog or Power Metal"
positive,"Great Fun: Well done and entertaining, we watch it over and over and always enjoy it. I especially enjoy it because it's a TRUE story of forgiveness"
positive,"typical brilliant Douglas Adams: Bought it to complete my collection of Douglas Adams' and if you've been reading the rest, you'd know how good this'd be."
positive,"Grisham returns to fine form...: With 'The Last Juror', John Grisham has delivered a novel that will please fans of both his courtroom dramas and his other more literary works. While a slower-moving story than some of his other legal thrillers, I found the combination of the courtroom scenes juxtaposed with the snapshots of Clanton life circa the 'Old South/New South' era to be very effective. You really feel as if you get to know (and care for) the main characters...especially Willie Traynor and Callie.Pick this one up and give it a try...you shouldn't be disappointed!!"
positive,"ulu, Live at the Wetlands Preserve NYC.: Great CD. Glad I learned about this band. They do a GREAT cover of Super Mario Brothers. This is a new twist to Jazz."
positive,"Great Beginnings: I listened to this superb CD all the way to Walter Reed and back home. I found myself singing along with Clay Aiken even though I didn't even know the words yet. I particularly liked No More Sad Song, I Survived You, and Perfect Day. The tunes are catchy, Clay's voice is heavenly, and he has just the right amount of passion in each song to make it work. I do think that some of the background vocals and music could be toned down, but it didn't ruin it for me. I liked the CD more each time I heard it. It's a great beginning CD for Clay and just the first of many for this incredible young man. You Go Clay!!!"
negative,"Typical of current technology: This keyboard works about as well as any of the wireless keyboards I've used. As usual the pointing device works about as well as that of any laptop (pretty bad). It also sometimes misses, or doubles up on keystrokes. The internet keys across the top are a waste of time, mainly because the included software is pretty poor. It does not integrate well with Windows XP, and appears to have been written for a much earlier version. As usual, no Linux version of the software. Keep in mind though, I've tried many wireless keyboards in the past, and they are all pretty much like this one."
negative,"Politically Correct Vandalism: The rating is for THIS edition of the book, feminist ideologue Elaine Showalter's genital revisionism blots the text everywhere. Nor is the theme concerned with the ""tension between social responsibility & individual and artistic freedom"" except in the fevered dreams of academic collectivists obsessed with ""group identities"" who have instigated more cultural disintegration then anyone since the anarchist 60's by eroding all Individual Responsibility & intellectual standards. Since acquiring a CEO from Disney the Penguin Classics once a distinguished series has become largely a pulpit for multiculturalists, feminists, post-colonial theorists and academic careerists brainwashed by Edward Said to ""re-frame"" ""de-construct"" and deface in the name of a politically reductive, emotionally vacuous jihad against Western Culture. Showalter's a scumbag."
positive,"Little Women: This book just makes me smile! Perfect for light reading. You won' t regret getting this cute book. Read it, you' 'll love it."
negative,"Laughable: Having read an excerpt of this travesty I must say that, while having the patience to write a book at 17 is admirable,it does not mean that said book is worth publishing and this patently isn't.Painfully derivative and crammed with embarrasingly clumsy phraseology,I can only hope that Mr Paolini looks back on this in 30 years and thinks ""Dear god, I am the luckiest man on god's green earth, that this rubbish sold so well."""
negative,"Do not buy this sink: I bought this sink from a major home improvement store 2 years ago, and I wish there had been warnings online before I did. One reviewer said it stains when you simply look at it, and that is no exaggeration. It must be a highly reactive material; even a bread crumb will stain it. I scour it multiple times a day, and I find I'm reluctant to even wash my hands in it after I've scrubbed it because even that will leave a stain which must be scoured out again. I plan to replace it with stainless steel, even though I love the look of white."
positive,Lots of fun.: I have rated this item a little bit lower because it does not come with anything else besides these two train tracks. These two wavy train tracks need something under them to build a hill/bridge. It would be nice if you could buy a set with blocks that could be used to hold up the pieces. We have used a small blocks from our own block set to hold up the pieces and that worked fine.These are sturdy pieces that have been through three kids playing and playing and stepping on them and setting them up and taking them down and so on. They have made our train tracks much more fun.Well worth the money. Just be warned you will need something to 'hold up the hill/bridge'.Enjoy.
positive,"Good Book: I was looking for a simple rebuild manual for this series of GM I6 motors. Since this is the only thing close that's available, I bought it. I'm only restoring my engine, but if you want to hot rod your motor, this has some great info and tips. Even if you're like me and only interested in restoration, it's better to overshoot when it comes to knowledge."
positive,"Schwarzenegger. How can you go wrong?: Dated production of course, but still one of the early classic Schwarzenegger movies. With a little better writing and producing Conan could have become one of the all time great movie series I believe."
negative,Uncomfortable around neck: The life jacket is cheap and looks nice but it's not very comfortable to wear. I have had multiple people try it on to see if it was just my body composition and they all said it was uncomfortable around the neck.
positive,"Bilbo Baggins and Martin Shaw - great friends!: The Hobbit is such a charming story and Bilbo so endearing, who wouldn't enjoy having the book read to them. But when it's done by such a consummate performer as Martin Shaw! Heaven! It is truly truly ""preciousssss""."
positive,"The ""Lisa"" Spenser mentioned in SMALL VICES is explained: As with SMALL VICES, this is edgier than the old TV series and Lifetime movies, stays fairly true to the book, has iffy casting choices (they're on their fourth Belson), and was filmed in Canada rather than anywhere near Massachusetts. They didn't even bother to get any Boston PD paraphenelia when Quirk and Belson make their appearances. I first saw this shortly after seeing WITCHBLADE, so I felt that Yancy Butler didn't really fit as Lisa, since the role is a lot weaker and passive than anything else I've seen Yancy do in the past. But it was interesting to see Spenser work with Vincent del Rio's enforcer Chollo, since Hawk is off in Burma for the duration of this one, and get a look at the Latino shadow world in the fictional town of Proctor."
negative,"typical entitled woman's rant: This is more of a pamphlet really. It is 100 pages long but the print is huge. There is no discussion of cultural expectations or changes in male-female relationships. I was looking for a thoughtful discussion of etiquette. What I got was a particular woman's ranting about what kind of man she wants and what she finds irritating in the men she dates. Personally, I'm not sure the author is the type of woman I am looking for, so I didn't find the ""book"" very helpful."
positive,"Practical and Great Learning Tool: Unlike most other techniques books, the techniques shown here are very practical and easily tried out, with the f-stops, FL and shutter on every photo (unlike many other books). Most of the techniques you will ever need are included, and more. Well served as a field guide too, it's fairly small to tuck into the camera bag.Excellent writeups and light-hearted reading, so good it's one of my most often read books. Not much of a coffee table since the images are fairly small. Another excellent book from Lee is Night and Low Light Photography, a seldom touched area of photography."
positive,"One Wish- The Holiday Album (DVD) whitney Houston: I received this item within 2 days of ordering, I love Whitney Houston's music & was surprised to see she had a x-mas dvd out, so i jumped at the chance to purchase this even thou Christmas is still 3 months away. I rate this seller a 5 (EXCELLENT), & I will order from this company again."
positive,"Effective product: These toothpicks work very, very well. The brush on the end is particularly effective. When the current supply is finished, I will reorder!"
positive,"Way Better Than All the Modern Design Thinking ""Guides"": Way ahead of his time. Design for the Real World contains all of the messages about creativity, design thinking, sustainable design, appropriate technology that are being echoed all around the design community now...but he wrote this THIRTY YEARS AGO. And the amazing thing is that nearly every one of his comments is still just as applicable today. If only everyone had listened the first time.Much more interesting than the IDEO guides and other ""creativity"" authors such as Ken Robinson."
positive,"Original Blue Eyed Soul: A truly 60's soul recording. Cochran's recording of his most famous piece of material , ""Last Kiss"", is no where close to being the best recording on the CD , but no one sings "" Last Kiss "" like J Frank Wilson. The selections are some of the best 60's soul music which never got the air play it should have received."
positive,"unknown Africa: You don't expect music from africa to be so profesionally produced. Me from the white world, don't understand the lyrics, but we do understand the music which is a mixture between salsa, soukous and fado with always the african feeling for rithem. The soft almost borred voice of Oliver N'goma fits pefectly in the music. The CD is recorded in France Paris, you can hear that professionals have been working on the CD. A must for a hot, lazy night.greetings Arno, Amsterdam"
negative,"Just because she couldn't do it: Doesn't mean other women can't. This is complete drivel. There are thousands of happy children of working moms (myself included) who would disagree with the author that working moms somehow can't be good mothers.Furthermore, this is classic Michelle Bachmann hypocrisy. If the author truly believes that women are best off staying at home and washing dishes, perhaps she shouldn't be writing a book. Her husband should be the author.In the meantime, leave the working moms who can pull it off alone."
positive,great cream: I LOVE this product. I've only been using it 2 weeks and already I see a difference. Once I get a tan the dimples will be much less noticeable as well. My skin is so much softer and I notice I don't have to shave as much either...not sure if that's from the lotion but I'll let it take the credit!! I have already recommended this to MANY friends and some enemies...lol.
positive,Beautiful chain: Perfect strong yet deceivingly delicate-looking chain. I purchased a pendant which came with a flimsy chain and swapped this one in. It sparkles brightly and can be used for light- to heavy- pendants of higher quality metal. FYI: The chain is wrapped in a way that keeps it from being as flexible as lighter chains.
negative,"A Journey With a Thousand Different Directions: This book had so much potential to be far more than what it was. I agree with other customers who said it started off well, but all of sudden there were so many U-turns and loops and twists that it seems as though the writers were still brainstorming what they wanted to do with all the information they had. It was poorly written and it takes away what probably could have been a journey worth reading. I think maybe Lula should have considered someone else to do her biography. Either these writers were inexperienced or had too many projects on their plates and just stuffed this one in."
positive,"It was a good book. It is a good healing book, journal.: This book was very good to help with the healing process. I used it for a journal and it's a great reference book! I would recommend this to anyone who has lost a child."
negative,"Terrible Shipping and Awful Customer Service: I requested for two day shipping and was then informed that I would not receive this product until after the new year, being almost two and a half weeks later. ( December 20th - January 5th - 7th ) After checking back with the website in January I was then informed that I would not receive the product until possibly January 19th. That's a full month without having this dvd after purchasing it. This is inconsistent and childish, I would expect service such as this from a twelve year old who's trying to make his first sale on a cheap product that doesn't work. I will never buy from here again, especially around the holidays because doing so is apparently a waste of time and money. Thank you for this awful experience and I hope your business depletes so intensely you're then FORCED to administer good service."
negative,Kind of a sleeper: Kind of puts you to sleep unless you are totally interested in Jones. Sad that he got so many people to follow him all the way to death via Kool Aid.
positive,"Essential Reading for Anyone Involved with Fundraising: After more than three decades in fundraising, I have not come across a book like this that sums up the best thoughts about ""the raising of money"" in such a concise and powerful way. Whenever someone asks me what they can read to learn about fundraising, I recommend this book. And in this day of so many organizations seeking simply to preserve themselves regardless of the effectiveness of their programs, Jim Lord's words continue to resonate for me: ""Organizations don't have needs...people do."" Quite simply the best single book about fundraising I've come across."
positive,"Pearl Jam Will Never Die: I know a lot of people who reviewed this album are saying, ""It's not vintage Pearl Jam,"" or, ""The songs suck because they're slow!!!"" That's complete and utter BS. Pearl Jam's talent really comes through in this album. Mike McCready's beguiling guitar work will make you gasp in amazement because some of the guitar work is absolutely unbelievable. Eddie Vedder also comes through strongly, offering a top-notch vocal performance. Great all-around effort and it really paid off. Congrats PJ, you've done it again!"
negative,"Vendor sent wrong book: I ordered ""The One Minute Manager"", I got ""Putting the One Minute Manager to Work"".I decided to keep it, but will am not pleased with Amazon on this order."
positive,intersting: This book has opend up my eyes. Robert Frost is in my mind one of the best potes in the world.
negative,"A very bad choice: The designers threw in the works and the lone star represents a point for design ingenuity. Problem is this toy is nearly impossible to build and it's more than the comically unreadable directions that are at fault. I have built many a toy but never found one this resistant to having its snap on parts snap on and of course if and when they finally do, the least shake will undo your labor. Sure to end in tears and frustration for all."
negative,"Terrible movie... I should have known better. I did know better. But, in the words of Crow T. Robot: ""I did it anyway."": What to say about this movie? Terrible, wooden, hack acting. Bad/uneven lighting. Terrible CGI special effects. Hitler's over-acting head on a bad CGI robotic body. Nazi UFO. Hack job rip-off ofIron Sky.Frankly, the special features, for what they are, are actually more interesting than the movie itself. Not that they're super-interesting. But thee are features on pre-production, cast & location and one on the main production. Each one is all of about 5+ minutes long.And there's a commentary track.But those are about the only special features and hardly salvage this stink-burger.Overall, I'll rate this one a 'pass.' I might pick up Iron Sky at some point and see if it's any better, what-so-ever. One can hope. But the general premise is hokey to begin with, so I'm not holding out much hope on that one either. =o\"
positive,"Excellent: I have two sandisk cruzer flash drives, and i have to say, they're great. The first one i got has been with me for years, and it's still working great.The retractable usb connector elliminates the need of a cap, so you never have to worry about loosing it. The materials are very high quality, and the U3 software is usefull for some applications.In my opinion, this is the best usb flash drive out there.I actually started trusting sandisk after this, and went to the store to buy a sansa e260, wich is great too."
positive,"Excellent ""How To"" for Bowen Therapy: This video details step by step the Bowen moves in such a way that even a 5 yr old could do it. Very precise and easy to follow, a bit tideous at times, but well worth the investment. (I paid over $1000 for a Live Bowen course and didn't get as much out of it as with the video!)"
positive,If only stoners could: Popping this review in because I saw it in my friend house. It cracks me up to think that stoners could get up from their backsides to grow. If you are a stoner who can do that then go for it. It is fxxkxng planet sized book. I dont know if stoners would do this but if they did we would have much better blow for it. Ban MEX BRICKWEED and give us some skunk. Oh it is banned already. They should make this stuff legal though. Anyway it is a planet sized book about growing. Makes my school biology book look stupid if that means anything. They should teach this instead. I am sure we would learn lots more if they did. More intresting if you ask me.
negative,"Nu Stylz, lol: Anyone else think it's hilarious that they have this imaginary group nu stylz? I mean, it's nsync, everyone can tell (right?). Well, about this CD, I wouldn't reccomend it. If you're an nsync fan you HAVE all these songs. Although it is only five bucks, so if you like these songs but don't have their album it's worth it. Hope it helps. Don't you think it's weird though, nu stylz, nsync... weird."
positive,"Just In Case: I've only been married once and have no imminent plans to do it again. However, once I picked up Nettleton's book I couldn't put it down. It seems like a terrific resource not just for the second (or third, or fourth) time around, but even for those taking the leap for the first time. The author makes all the details seem actually manageable through the stories and checklists and her unique insights. I have a copy JUST IN CASE I might need it in the future as well as to help me guide friends and family who are going through the process."
positive,"Acoustic blues well done: Rory Block had done a number of CDs in her long career and most of them are straight acoustic blues with a little gospel thrown in. This is a typical effort. John Sebastian plays harmonica on ""Love My Blues Away"" and Block plays acoustic guitar and keyboards on all songs. Block also produced and sang lead and background vocals so this is her record even when she's doing someone else's song. Highlights include ""Swing Low"" and ""Just Like A Man"". If you are a fan of her other acoustic blues efforts, this is another typically good one to enjoy. 4.5 Stars"
negative,"Intimate Desires: THis DVD is full of these two young models mostly naked. I thought this was a movie, but it isn't. This DVD is a collection of video/photo session with the two models interspliced with scenese from another DVD. I believe one of the other DVDs is called ""Lady in Heat,"" which should be a collection of 3 vignettes. All we get is a series of poses, none of which lasts more than 8 seconds, and a few scenes of kissing. I don't mind the tameness of these two beautiful girls together (there is nothing hardcore here), but I do mind the leftover, hash job the producers of this video have offered us."
negative,"Guys: Read Up On Your Prey and Strengthen Your Game Skills: Guys, this is a great book to read for no other reason than it will help you strengthen your game and read what other women are reading about us. Find out if you are unwittingly giving yourself away with unsaid cues and learn what women are looking for in men, especially what they are wanting men to be looking for in women. Versatility is the name of the game in playing the game, and reading up on your prey and what drives them psychologically will definitely give you an advantage. Learn of their desires, their needs, and how to placate and play to the sense of independence of the ""strong woman.""Sharpen you skills by learning more on how your taget thinks and know how to better present yourself in the manner that such women are looking to find in a man."
negative,"way too big: This product is NOT intended for a beginner...i had many toys and this one by far caught me by suprise on how big it is. The shaft is too big and makes it uncomfortable unless used with the right lubrication. Being a smaller/petite woman, it was a little uncomfortable for me b/c of the size...but other than that, it was very pleasurable."
positive,"great fishing song on this one!: hey, it da yoopers!nothing but funI bought several of these mainly out of curiosity and after listening so them, I decided to share them with a friend of mine.these guys have a great timedown to earth people."
positive,Great for those who love historical fiction!: This a great biblical history series...Although bk 1 is strictly fiction it is a good story of Hezikiah's early years. Well written andputs you in the time frame of what was happening back then. I look forward to the rest of the series!
negative,"Not even one star to be honest: This is just an album full of oversung sappy, cheesy lyrics. Horrible production from the AI machine. Where do they find these songwriters?And could Clay over enunciate a little more?Yes, he won't sing about sex, but he's singing about being invisible and watching someone in their room. <@@> Scary!"
negative,Lost my Bike: The fasteners on this thing are awful. I was driving down the highway and after going over a bridge the bike flew off my car because the fasteners stripped and came undone.Spend more money on a nicer bike rack. Now I have to get a new bike and rack instead of paying maybe 50 bucks more and still having a bike.
negative,"Stilted dialogue, one-dimensional characters: I could not finish this book. Unlike the other reviewers, I was not the least bit impressed by the quality of the writing. The dialogue was stilted and the characters were one-dimensional. Save your money. Read Mike Tidwell's Ponds of Kalambayi if you're interested in a Peace Corps novel set in Africa. Tidwell's book is everything that The Road Builder is not."
negative,"bloody awful: sounds like a third world elementary school class on a field trip to a crack factory. if this music is so revolutionary and worldly, how come the only people listening to it are skinny white boys who wear hats with earflaps indoors?"
negative,don't buy this cd if you don't like chick bands: this CD blows. tubthumbing was cool at first and then it got old real fast. the rest of the songs blow. I am so sick of this CD if anyone wants to buy it from me... wait I'll pay you to take it. I think they need to have a 0 rating instead of 1. don't buy this CD
positive,"Rabbit is Great!: Let's get the negative out of the way first. The battery cover is very loose and I expect it to fall off at any time. Also, turning on the pearls really cuts back on the vibrating rabbit, which pretty much leaves you a choice of using one or the other. The pearls are also pretty loud.Now, for the positive. The rabbit is awesome! The ears are perfectly positioned and are firm enough to provide just the right amount of friction. The control for the rabbit provides a good range of vibration, which is easily adjustable.The insertable portion is smoother and firmer than toys I've had previously, which is a definate plus. I am well pleased with the product overall."
negative,"Apparently the illustrator hasn't read the book: Look folks, read the publisher's blurb about this book. Especially pay attention to the part where it quotes Whatshername describing herself, or her work, or some such thing. Apparently she hasn't even learned that sentences are supposed to contain verbs.Seriously, this books is a travesty. The publishers have taken one of the greatest books on writing in English and have trivialized it by adding illustrations that profit little and editorial changes that destroy the book's original integrity. Please buy the original instead of this edition."
positive,"Light and airy perfume.: I ordered this last year and had a great experience with this company. The Perfume is wonderful, very light and clean feeling. I love to put it on right before bedtime. You won't be disappointed in this fragrance."
negative,"Problem With Batteries - Beach Audio Renegs on Return: The first phone went out within 30 days. Got along without it, until the second phone stopped working.Beach Audio instructed me to re-order, and they'd send me a Return Authorization. Then they renegged.I will not do business with Beach Audio again."
positive,A Christmas Carol: This is a wonderfully written book that gets you into the Christmas spirit and teaches a great lesson about generosity
negative,"A spotty, disjointed, incomplete mess: Fortunately I rented this from Neflix and did not buy it. I would not recommend that anyone who knows anything about or has any interest in American Hardcore buy this CD. First, it is impossible to document the history of this genre of American music without mentioning and focusing somewhat on the Dead Kennedys. DK was as important, if not more important, than Black Flag. This is a mess and should be avoided."
negative,"Wizard Abroad: So predictable... I'd rather read a boring school textbook than this. =/ Sorry, Ms. Duane."
negative,"Deducted fundings even if I hadn't finalized the order!: Started an order, which I never completed. Looked at my card and they had withheld the amount for the order, which I never completed! Called them, and they confirm that I haven't placed an order, but they are unable to credit my account in another 10 days! This was on a gift card!The customer service agent promised to take care of it first thing and he even stated that he was going to email me immediately the next morning. Two days later, after no email, I called and they have no idea of my issue, and we start over again with the talk about the 10 days. Noone seems to know why they've taken over $200 from the card."
negative,"Doesn't work too well.: Grinding this stuff for hours only took my mining from 360-362. Total BS. Needs moar ore. Oh well, at least it's not as bad as the grinding I went through with Herbalism.Also, my gnome grew three inches and an extra pinky finger. Is this normal? I'm going to contact the manufacturer."
positive,"GREAT!: BC Camplight is Burt Bacharach, Randy Newman, Brian Wilson, and Badly Drawn Boy rolled into one delicious songwriter. Beautiful melodies, eccentric and unique production. This one should help eventually launch BC into the upper stratos of indie pop."
negative,"too much pop: Enya has such a lovely voice. I have truly enjoyed her music, but this CD was a big disappointment. It seemed to stray from her roots. Enya's music has always taken me to my Celtic roots, but this CD was too much pop."
negative,"You get what you pay for.: The dimensions of the miter slot are not provided for this item. Probably because it is undersize. The dimension is 1/4"" deep x 3/4"" wide. This means that any standard miter gauge or sliding shaper jig, will ride high and rock side to side with no table support. The miter gauge supplied is all plastic and is a grand total of 3"" long.It is also difficult to adjust the extension table sections low enough so that they do not interfere with the sliding miter gauge or shaper jig.The only plus on this set-up is a large, easy to access on/off switch.I don't understand why anyone would manufacture an item with so many shortcomings, when it would be just as easy to make the thing right in the first place.The best use for this product would be to mount a non-functioning router, and give the set to a child to play 'Carpenter' with.PS: Shipping was very expensive, ie: 50% of the cost of the item."
negative,"Biggest Movie Dissapointment Since Godfather Part III!: If you haven't seen this movie yet, go see it. You will see what I mean. Tobey Maguire did a very poor job acting compared to the first Spiderman. Kirsten Dunst did an alright job however, but not as good as she should have done.The plot was very boring with very little action. They focused mostly on Peter's relationship with MJ. Who wants to see that garbage in an action film. There are very few fight scenes and they were not very good. Also the special effects in this movie were supposed to be awesome. THEY SUCKED!!!!!!! For example, the fireball thing looked terrible, also at the end of the movie the helicopters looked like they were toys.They should just stick with the comic books and not stray off."
positive,"candid, studio recordings, some of walters' best: From the deep reverb of ""high temperature"" to the rockin', driving rhythm of ""my babe"", this selection of cuts reveals Little Walters' breadth and command of the diatonic harp as well as the chromatic sticks. Little Walter was an innovator with the electronics-mic-amp-hallway combinations, great studio effects and as the lickin'-stick ""maestro"" produced the most full-bodied and extraordinary harp sounds and blues music of anyone--then or now. Contemporary harp players are still playing catch-up to this man. This CD is a must-have for fans of the ""southside Chicago"" 50's sound."
positive,"A great study of the human psyche: Circa 1962 Clavell astounds the reader with his insight to the human condition. From the beginning until the end, King Rat never ceases to surprise and evoke the dark humor concurrent withthe grim reality of terrible circumstances. I remember seeing this book in countless rucks during Viet Nam, read and re-read, taped together, dog eared and in heavily stressed condition then, passed along."
positive,For anyone who loves great vocals: I cannot speak any french so I have no idea what she's singing about. Doesn't matter. This cd is amazing. And what is great is that you don't have to be her typical fan to like it. The production seems different on this cd. It's more of a low key affair but her vocal delivery will blow you away. Check out all the 5 star reviews this cd gets. This is one for a true music lover.
positive,"Joan Baez in Spanish!: I loved this when it was a record, back in the old days...songs I grew up with, folk songs, and Joan Baez is always full of soul...can't go wrong."
negative,"disappointing read.: This book started off well and you really got a feel for this wonderful and special older woman who was a healer and the central character. As the book progressed it became a struggle to read because of the other characters and their inter-relationships. It simply never came together for me.I have, however, enjoyed other Kaye Gibbons books."
positive,"Western DVD: John Wayne, what can you say? And it is helping me complete my John Wayne llibrary of all his movies!I'm not a big Henry Fonda fan, but good because of JW & other cast members."
positive,"come and see-amended service: My previous review told of a negative review. The company read my review and made amendments. Sometimes products sneek through that appear good. With further investigation, the product is unworthy. I thank-you so much for refunding my money and caring enough to respond so quick. I will definately make more orders through your company. Thamk- you, Treetoad."
negative,"Balls: There is nothing I like more than a movie about balls. I like it when the whole plot is based around big hairy balls. Would you believe that in this movie they are throwing their balls at each other while Ben Stiller tries to act like he knows how to act. Oh sure, Stiller is the villan in the movie. But he is about as convincing as a stick of butter is tough in the microwave. The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because I like balls."
positive,"Brain-teaser, brilliant, historical mystery: Some say this book is responsible for the renewed interest in Richard III. Whether true or not, it certainly peaked my curiosity.It's chock full of history. But I have one word of caution: If you know nothing about the Wars of the Roses, the reign of Edward IV or Richard III, I recommend you first read Sharon Kay Penman's THE SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR. Without a good foundation in the history of the times, you'll miss much of the subtle references.On the other hand, the unveiling of Richard III (biased in favor of the man) appears secondary to the point of the book. Rather, I think Tey meant to call historians to task. If history were written after proper (or legal) interpretation of the evidence at hand, she seems to contend, it might prove a whole lot more accurate."
negative,"Save Yourself: I saw this and I must say I felt I was trapped in a sophomoric misunderstanding of Ingmar Bergman. If you want beautiful cinematographic postcards of the Pacific Northwest, by all means. If you want a lifeless P.C. apology to Japanese-Americans, by all means. If you want a movie that you can stay awake through . . . run, run, run to your nearest made-for-televison movie . . .you'll thank me."
positive,"A really sweet love story!: I'm a big ""Dirty Dancing"" fan, ever since I first saw the movie in 1987 or so. The dancing and the music still give me the thrills, every time I watch it. The movie also shows what real love is all about, and how important it is to believe in yourself despite other people's opinions! Great film!"
negative,"Half the Story: I'm afraid that Dr. Brinkley missed the boat on this one. By ignoring the Swift Boat Vets, he lost any claim to having written an honest biography of Kerry's war months. Kerry's unwillingness to release his military file would have signaled to any true biographer that there is more to this story than just Kerry's diary."
negative,Never received: It is now June 5th and the cd has not arrived. Not happy. How do I get my money back? I had planned to perform a musical freestyle on my horse for a huge charity fair with this music but had to change my plans and use another selection as it takes weeks to compose the choreography and practice the timing with the horse..
positive,"Super Informative...nice alternative.: I was on the fence about a child birth class, so I bought this video. I watched the first lesson on her website and that was really helpful. I really liked it. Sheri is fun. She knows her stuff and you feel like you are in the class with them. It did drone on at some points (medical interventions/medications/cord blood banking). When you get to the second disc, she talks about medications, positions, and really important stuff, but after a few mins it gets to be too much. Watch this in small increments! It makes processing the information so much easier. You can always go back and watch important sections again :-))) I plan on buying the breastfeeding video!!"
positive,This is the real thing: Gillette Fusion blades are insanely expensive and a lot of the cheaper fusion blades on Amazon are either fake or seconds that failed QC. This supplier has the real thing and its the best price you'll find.
negative,"play: after listening to this album a couple of time, I got so sick of hearing it, it not one of those albums that grows in appreciation the more u listen to it, the only half decent tracks, would b towards the end. i can just say-i',m glad i got it off a friend because it's not worth paying the money for. it blues with a facelift that didn't seem to work out too well."
positive,"Great Ball: I sit on this ball as an alternative to a desk chair. I use this ball many hours a day, at 190lbs. Besides slowly and decidedly building up my core muscles this ball is also used for situps, extension and flexion work. It is a great price and a solid product."
positive,"Content as expected.: The cover was bent but I had to use it anyway as it was a gift, a slight bit embarrassing!"
negative,"Ulysses: This particular edition in its kindle gratis version is a shame.It has lost many paragraphs of the original text. It is made in such a crazy disorder that I needed another expensive edition to try to understand this book.This is the perfect example on why any serious reader will end by hating the e-books.It is free, yes, but that is no excuse for such a lousy work.Ulysses"
negative,problems with the antenna: i had to order a SWR meter due to transmitting a ton of static when talking to other drivers. they said its extreamly statically and i sound like charlie browns teacher so i hope with getting a SWR meter this will fix the issue otherwise im going to get my money back. i will give this a 2 star rating only becuse for its size its pretty cheap
positive,"Absolutely beautiful....great workmanship...worth every cent: I was so excited to receive this....great packaging...the product arrived in pristine condition and I could not be more please. It looks so beautiful, and I have seen some Finch and hummingbirds enjoying it. My cardinals have finnaly discovered it....what a treat. I ordered the smaller feeder, but I may end up getting the large one because I like it so much."
positive,"Best Book Ever Written!!!!!: A book filled with love and romance with a splash of action, there isn't any book in the world better written"
positive,"Lauryn is a blessed and talented woman: Anyone with anything negative to say about Lauryn or her music don't know what she is about and need to go elsewhere with the negativity. She is an outrageously talented, God-fearing woman who is getting her positive messages out to those who want and need to hear them. God has Lauryn's back and when He's got it, nothing negative is going to affect her. Lauryn is not a racist and has said so. Having pride in one's race is not a crime and her music is here to uplift. As a listener, you have to be in the midset that Lauryn is in to really understand and appreciate her music. The album is excellent."
negative,"Only because I can't give it 1/2 a star: There aren't enough words in the English language to express my utter loathing and contempt for this book. I had heard that Pratchett was ""satirical"", ""devious"", ""irreverent"", ""magical"", ""entertaining"" and ""above all funny"".Sadly ""Men at Arms"" is none of the above. Pratchett is trying to be Douglas Adams and fails at it miserably. This story in particular was trite, condisending, and supremly unfunny. His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of ""ho ho ho see how clever I am!"" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame. It wasn't. It was just lame."
positive,"Rekindling Love: Mistakes can never be undone, but rectification is possible. Years after their marriage died, Ross and Tessa are drawn back together when one of their sons is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Returning to what has not been his home in a long time, Ross is met with a mix of hostility, need, and love. Before much time passes, he realizes that his son is not the only one in need of healing. With a society that has been torn apart by issues just like this, the potential audience for it is vast. Mistakes are not glossed over, but proven not to be fatal. This will give hope to thousands."
negative,"what you will need to begin to sew: Boring, speaker very unenthusiastic, not enough sewing information"
positive,"Average sound and vision , music slick but involving: Most of Roxy's fans will buy all their DVD's as each of them offers a different lineup of the band and different songs .This lineup had an exceptional rhythm section , who help give the songs a lift and they make me want to watch and listen again and again .One gets a good idea of how mellow Roxy could be as the ballads are convincingly done , with stirring lead work by Neil Hubbard on MY ONLY LOVE being the highpoint of a standout version .A good release - maybe one day they will be able to clean up the picture . I'm very happy with the music , however .Worth a spin for those fans of this influential band ."
positive,"A note to readers: I'm in progress of reading this book, and I am finding it rather intrigueing. I would like to mention to those of you who have strongly opposed this book in reviews, that statisticsts are merely trends observed in nature and not facts. That said, it would be interesting to know the birth order of those who oppose and those who agree with Dr. Sulloway's observations. I'm willing to bet that the results of that survey would support his findings. By the way... I'm the youngest of 4."
positive,HP C4965A #83 UV LIght Magenta Printhead: What we wanted at a great price! Item shipped quickly with free freight. We hope to be able to find more deals like this for our printer. Thanks!
positive,"Effortlessly perfect!!! TiVo's Wireless is cool!: We're a MAC family, so my apprehension to any ""works with PC or Mac"" device is based on past bad experiences. This baby works!TiVo's Wireless G USB Network Adapter worked so fast that I was sure that I made a mistake. With the Airport in the next room and this tiny toy hooked up to the TiVo a room away, we're sending photos through Yahoo! and ENJOYING TV like never before. We watch less, but watch much, much better. I now program shows to record at work or anywhere at an hour's notice.Mindblowingly cool and a true ""show-off"" item that works 100% perfectly!"
negative,Annoyed: This is the most nasty Catholic bashing novel I have ever read. There must be a better way to get an opinion accross.
negative,"Price EXTREMELY Inflated: This is a GREAT product (I've used it pretty much everyday for the last 8 years and it really diminishes the dark circles under my eyes), BUT this product generally retails for $40 at Nordstrom and Sephora. At a $100, it's highway robbery at a 250% markup. I know I will never be buying anything from BatheandBeauty unless I asked to be mugged on purpose."
negative,"Could do better: Nice movie, great sound effects it was one of the first movies to succesfully use Dobly Digital. Sadly enough this NOT ""the directors cut"", and is missing some crucial parts of the movie. Because of this the movie is kinda boring.If you want to buy this movie, then skip this one and go straight to the directors cut. It also include's a nice documentary about movie which gives an nice inside view of the history of modern movie making."
positive,"Slow & Low (That Is, In Fact, the Tempo): A great price for an album that I thought I'd never see again (lost in a move). Do not judge him by his partnership w/ Digweed: Sasha's debut solo is the chillout lounge you go to after wrecking the dance floor, only to find yourself bobbing to the infectious beats with an energy you thought you had already expended. This album is in my opinion a modern classic.Favorite Track: Mr. Tiddles"
negative,"1 good chapter: The info in this book is terrible for a novice grower and an expert can use only the section on BREEDING thats it the only detailed chapter in the whole book.Another book lost in the past 70s and 80s knowledge of growing,and odd enough all the plant pics are of poor unhealthy,badly pruned,and terrible bud pics .....If you went by this book you will end up with the ABSOLUTE CRAP YOU WILL SEE IN IT!!!!!!!This guy makes me want to write a book on the subject very much,this book should be sent to 1970..............GEORGE CERVANTES REVISED INDOOR HORTICULURE IS YOUR BEST BUY TODAY and this book only for BREEDING..."
positive,"Cut to the Chase - Its a good cheaper PScan Unit...: The unit functions well. Chasis and disk drawer are a bit flimsy, but that is to be expected at this price range. Audio and Video DAC performance is optimal. 540 PScan picture quality is optimal on my Toshiba 65X81 "" HDTV. The only feature missing that I would want would be the center voice amplification enhancement that some newer models offer, but then again my Sony ES tuner takes care of that for me, so it really doesn't bother me. Not remotely interested in playing MP3s, which is what other folks complain about. Why in the world would anybody want to play MP3's on a proprietary home unit anyhow, its not a computer folks? To save a few bucks, get over it. Play the accepted widestream format, CD!!! Overall can't beat the current $179.00 price tag for the included features. End of story..."
positive,"STRONG WRITING, PAINFUL HONESTY: Mr. Hartley has given us a book of our times. He is literally on the ground of the World Trade Center after the planes hit and goes into Iraq with the invasion. There is a certain lack of pretension in his style and I feel that the writing and the photos he gives us are as close to the reality of being there without being there.He is not afraid to present himself as a humanist who is in love with the Army, which I am afraid will be far too complex for many who cannot reconcile that idea. His foibles, screw-ups, less than flattering lights are all in there.He says he has not read books of other wars and I believe him. If he did, the style and degree of openess would be very different. Without trying to be poetic or profound, he testifies to the day-to-day grind of trying to make a difference in the occupation of a hostile land.This is as real as it gets."
negative,"Take a pass on this one: We have two reference systems in the home plus digital or analog over ethernet feeds to all of the other rooms. Speakers tend to be high end, source material ranges from digital music fed to dac's or cd's. I have two AudioSource 100's, one in the kitchen driving Energy's and one that drives a set of B&W;'s on the porch.Totally devoid of musicality. This amp will kill any source signal you put in it. Compared to any amp we've had in the past 40 years, this is the worst. The sound has nothing going for it, 0 energy, no low end, sounds like it compresses music, no soundstage, no rhythm, just plain boring."
positive,"Disposable drills: Pros: Lightweight, price, and powerful enough for a majority of home weekend projectsCons: Battery life span is bad. This would not be an issue, but makita battery packs are expensive. The price of replacement batteries is similar to the price I paid for the drill/flashlight/charger/2battery set. Battery pack is sealed so its not possible to access and replace the battery cells. battery cells are very cheap.Both my batteries are dead. I got good use out of the drill but I'll have to buy another drill set.... Drills are becoming disposable items now!"
positive,"Interesting and readable account of a lost world: Thesiger's background and his detestation of the modern world (just after the end of the Second World War) made him uniquely suited to live and travel with the Bedu. It is astonishing that so few Westerners should have traveled to some of the places that Thesiger visited, until one reads of the difficulties that he had to overcome. I found his book to be a thoroughly enjoyable description of a fascinating people and an intruiging part of the world."
positive,"Works great!: I have one in my den because I sip slowly and it does keep my coffee warm. No setting on mine, just off or on but thats OK."
positive,"On a Clear Day, You Can See Forever: I was delighted when I got this, and have been delighted ever since. I do not believe in reincarnation, and some reject this movie for this reason. The story line, the photography, the music, the subtle and unsubtle ironies make this an all-time favorite for me. I heartily recommend it. '5' is not a high enough rating."
positive,"Love this.: I have to type 20 words so this will get published...bottom line, I am really glad I gave this product a shot...it does exactly what I wanted it to."
positive,"Great product: This is a great product at a very reasonable price, I have HDMI cables on all of our TVs and love the quality we get!!"
positive,"Welch Allyn thermometer: My health condition requires frequent monitoring of my temperature. The inexpensive thermometers were inconsistent and replacement batteries were hard to find. The Sure Temp Plus 690 costs more, but is very accurate, easy to use and AA batteries can be purchased anywhere. I feel confident in the readings. A back lit display would be nice, but is not essential. It probably would run down the batteries faster. I would recommend the item to anyone needing fast and accurate temp readings."
negative,"Bought out of the children's section..........has now been placed in the adult section...: As a grandmother preparing for a spring break with my grandchildren, I purchased this audio book so they would have something to keep them busy on a long ride of over 9hrs, when we were playing it it came to a part that I thought would be a little kissing however it became X rated for children....not knowing the author or reading any of Jean M Auel books before... this is not for the ears of children 6yrs to 12yrs of age....I on the other hand when my grandchildren went back home I finished the book...all but the sexual parts that go into real detail...would be great for kids.... its to bad that this book goes into that much detail this book as is should not be recommended for children as it was when I looked children books. I bought this out of the Children section.....and it has now been removed out of the Children's Section recommendation......."
positive,"A Must Have: We got this for my daughter before she was born mainly because it matched the theme of her room. It's been attached to her crib from the time she was 1 1/2 months old until now (she's 19 mos old) and it has been a LIFESAVER. When she was a baby and just learning to fall asleep on her own, we'd lay her down in her crib, start it and the soft music, lights and swimming fish would lull her to sleep. When she got a little older, she learned how to kick the button to start it and would lull herself back to sleep if she woke up in the middle of the night. Now, as a toddler, she plays with it if she wakes up in the middle of the night or from a nap instead of crying. I really don't know what we would have done without it. It's a definite MUST HAVE!"
negative,"Contamination of any sound intellect......: This movie is about some guy who has a one night stand. He owns up his betrayal, to his then, supposed to be future wife. In his guilt he tells her that maybe she should date other people, not thinking that she would actually have the nerve to do it. Boy was he wrong. I'll admit that after I started to become aware of what type of movie this was and how much it stunk, I ""flipped"" through the chapters. This movie showcases infidelity and sexually immoral behavior. This movie should not only be offensive to just African Americans, but to anyone who has a thread of descency or family values."
negative,"Very disappointing: I remember loving this movie. Now I reget buying it due to the extremely poor quality of the DVD. Aside from the grainy picture quality and poor sound and music, I am very angry that there was no mention that this was the FULL SCREEN version on Amazon. I will keep this in mind the next time I consider purchasing something through them."
positive,"Alively: Surprisingly, this captures the trippy, psychedelic energy of the Doors' live performances, resulting in a thoroughly fun listen. ""Light My Fire"" is just as trance-inducing as it should be, ""Little Red Rooster"" sounds just as dirty as it should, and ""Moonlight Drive"" feels just as mystical as one would expect. The only time it lags is when Morrison recites his damnedly sober poetry."
negative,"Poor cutting quality: These cable cutters are just about worthless. I purchased them to trim bicycle cable shielding and cables. They barely do either of these, when trying to cut shielding it simply folds the cable in half and then jams. I have tried different holding positions and placement of the shielding in the cutter, with simply no different results. They will cut the cables themselves if you get the placement perfect. They have chipped already and will probably only be used in situations where I don't care about having a clean cut."
negative,"Doesn't work for me.: I wish it worked -- but it doesn't for me. I have an old Land Rover Discovery with a working tape deck -- but I place this in with my iPhone attached and nothing. Sounds like it's wrestling around in there, in fact. Maybe other people will have more luck?Bobbywww.bobbyearle.com"
positive,"Wait, wait - it gets better!: There are people who will start reading this book then about 100 pages into it realize that it's going nowhere fast. Take my advice and keep reading. It gets much better, and more interesting. The ending is really good, and might have even upped this review a star.ac"
positive,"Very charming warm movie on a cold winter Saturday afternoon: This movie is very warm toned and sincere. I really give a lot of credit to film makers who can create a romantic comedy that is not contrived and unoriginal. Under the Tuscan Sun is a fresh romantic comedy that has a heart.Of course this is not a masterpiece that will change your perception of life and leave you breathless, but it will leave you smiling for at least a half an hour after it is over.Also, it has a really good point. So many times we force things to happen in our lives and and become totally frustrated in the process. It is indeed so much easier to just ""fall asleep and let the ladybugs crawl all over you"". You will see what I mean when you watch the movie.Highly recommended enterntainment."
negative,"Brilliant reading ruined by bad mastering: Douglas Adams' reading of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is truly engaging. The problem with this audio book is two-fold:1. None of the tracks has any text-encoding. This means that devices that read this information cannot use or display the CD names or track names. So, an iTunes won't read any CD names or track names, nor will any CD player that can show CD names or track names.2. CD #6 of the set repeats the same scene over and over, without ever reaching the ending.New Millenium Audio destroyed a perfectly enjoyable performance with its poor mastering of the CD."
positive,"Great Condition, Almost Exactly What I Expected: I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy."
negative,"i didn't like it!: I really didn't like this game. The steering stinks, The levels stink, and The cars are cool but are pretty slow."
negative,"Get the other printing: The only reason this copy is 50 dollars cheaper than the other printing of ""Field Quantization"" is that the manufacturers screwed up the margins, and the inner margin is tiny. Text is obscured, and it is not really usable without great sacrifice.I'm surprised Amazon even sells this copy. Don't get had."
negative,"Truly Horrible: Not even close to history. What's worse, is thay've taken an actual, heroic moment from our history, and turned it into a 1970's, Carter era, peice of schlock. I really like the japanese girlfriend subplot...what PC crap!But the worst part, was the horrid piecing together of footage of the wrong aircraft, at the wrong times. The wrong planes, the wrong ships...The only saving grace is Heston, he could add a touch of class to a Hillary Clinton/Rosie O'Donell lesbian scene....Oh well, I'll stick with ""a wing and a prayer"", real airplanes, real carriers, and closer to the truth....."
positive,"Just like the Picture.: Fast and Speed delivery! The ring is very SHINY and petite, great for a gift. It looks amazing in the light and goes great with everything.I would definitely recommend this ring for any buyers seeking a simple yet beautiful product."
positive,An unbelivable representation of society at any given time: William Golding is an absolute genious. This book is incredible and will appeal to anyone with a philisophical side. The in-depth symbolism is applicable towards any time period. Lord of the Flies is a a mind blowing experience and the reader will undoubtably gain from reading it.
negative,"awful music, awful songwriting, robotic performances: the songwriting is so below average; i'm finding it incredibly hard to believe that all of you people are buying it. you've been brainwashed by clive davis and his cronies at RCA. can't you see they're selling american idol, not clay aiken the singer. this is by far the best selling below average pop album in years. overpriced songwriters wrote the songs, overpriced producers produced the music and you're all fools for buying into this trite, vanilla music. shame on you."
negative,"extremely dull: I will admit, I had to read this for class, but I couldn't have been more bored. It just follows our little monk to be in his going crazy.But lets face it, if you are even looking at this book here, you are either really interested in this type of novel, or have to read it for school/business/other required reading"
negative,"Not very Good: I am very surprised to see so many good reviews of this CD. I work in a used CD store and we can't give this CD away. Every time I personally try to return it, we already have too many in stock to take it. I love Kiss but this Cd just doesn't have anything to it. There's no excitement. Most bands fizzle out after there prime time but Kiss was awesome in both the seventies and eighties and this Cd doesn't hold a candle to anything they have done in the past, with or without Ace and Peter. Listen to Amazon's previews for yourself, the lyrics are boring and so is the music."
negative,"Poor organization and editing hurt useful book: The problem with this book is that it really seems like the author and editor didn't care about putting out a great product.There are lots of problems with this book. There are far too many typos (it's hard to edit a chess book, but come one!) and the organization is horrid. It's easy to miss crucial subvariations, and the lack of proper indexing, combined with poor organization, makes it very hard to find the game you need.Schiller's ""strategic overview"" in the beginning is a great idea, but it's executed poorly. A few examples concerning advancing the d-pawn here (rather than just scattered throughout the book) would work wonders.So why two stars? Well, because despite its numerous flaws, I find myself using this book a lot. There aren't any other good books on the Tarasch defense these days, and it's an excellent weapon for the club player. There is a lot of good information in here, it's just so hard tofind!"
negative,"The worst movie ever!: In comparison to the book, this movie was not fully accurate and it moved very slowly. I did not enjoy watching this movie, nor did it add any insight to the novel. However, the parts that were included from the novel were correct and fairly accurate. The cast did a good job acting, but they did not have a good script to act out. It is not worth renting this movie, let alone purchasing it."
positive,"Greatest Cartoon Ever: ""The Last Unicorn"" is so wonderful! I am actually watching it this second. The animation is so beatiful. Although I am fourteen years old, I have always loved this movie. It has and will be my favorite animated movie for all time."
negative,"Big Disappointment - Not for small children: I was excited to finally find this title on DVD. I'd seen the show live in Chicago years ago and loved it. We've had the soundtrack on CD (fabulous) for years and it's one of my daughter's favorites. Unfortunately, the video version of this production is significantly different than the live show and, in my opinion, the music is not nearly as good (as the show or the CD soundtrack). Even more disturbing is the addition of several scenes that make this video inappropriate for small children. I can't understand why these sexual innuendos were added, they certainly don't add anything to the story and as far as adult entertainment is concerned they're pretty lame. With just a little effort this could have been a great family video."
positive,"Wallflowers Back & better than before, actually scratch that: As a avid Wallflower fan since 1996, I was a little dissapointed in this album. While, I do enjoy it, the tracks took me while to get used to. They aren't as catchy as Bringing Down The Horse, but do have some liking. I like slower songs sometimes, and this album does have a lot of them. But don't get me wrong, it is still a GREAT album. Anything these guys do is great. Just dont go into it expecting another Bringing Down The Horse. Reccomended Tracks: 3-Sleepwalker * 5-Witness * 9-Murder101 * 2-Hand Me Down"
negative,"The item received was a pirated copy: The recoring was so poor the picturea were smeared, I eas sent a copy by the V2d company that was originally taped by the spmeone off a television show....ridiculous!!!"
negative,"Does not keep my beverage hot or even very warm: Simply put, it does not keep my beverage hot or very warm. I've tried using different mugs and this thing is just not doing to the job. I read all the reviews before purchasing and gathered that I might have to try different mugs but that was not the case. The only reason I give it two stars is because it happens to keep my hot beverage warmer a bit longer (3 mins maybe?) than it would if I didnt have the warmer but in the end it cools down just the same. I would not purchase again."
positive,"No going back: 4 1/2Often considered this legendary player's best and generally cited as one of the overall greatest recordings of all time, ALS undoubtedly represents Coltrane and his excellent crew at their early avant-garde best (easily argued as a favorite period), of which this blisteringly brief output suggested a spiritual threshold, compositionally crossed, that could never be rescinded. It's not quite perfect although at only three taut tracks the quartet seems at a precise alignment between excess and restraint to promote such holy themes, parlaying the album into an experience unique to his dense catalog."
negative,"One show about nothing is enough: OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac."
positive,Works as stated: Install is simple recetion is good and removes the need for phone line. We have multiple tivos but cannot transfer between devices because we aquired units from other people and tivo will not give us permission to tranfer unless you own device. All in all good product/price.
positive,Harry Potter & The Goblet Of Fire (Full Screen): I got this particular movie for my daughter to make the set but i have the set & i have to say all of the movies of harry potter are very good.
positive,"""Mere"" Chrisitanity.... not ""mere"" at all.: As I worked my way through this classic by C.S. Lewis, I kept kicking myself for not reading it earlier in life. I have known about this work for 30 years but simply did not get around to reading it until I retired. My bad!!A great book. I will purchase copies for several friends and will bring it to the attention of Bible classes in which I participate.Great responses to the great questions of this age.Gerald C. Brunworth"
negative,"A o.k read but not a suspense or mystery: I read this with great anticipation and was let down. The characters are trite, a little sterotypical and the interaction between the two main characters was laughable at times. This novel plods and moves but never really engrosses you. In fact you begin to forget the mystery."
positive,Works well for my application...: This product works well for my specific applications of measuring small items in mm's. Its nice that it has an on/off switch as well as measuring in inches or mm's. My husband has used it also without complaint!
positive,to b skilz on mike jones: hey b skilz mike jones is hot and the name of the cut you are referring to is called Cuttin' peace
positive,"My kids love this book!!: This is a fun book. We first read it in the library and my kids loved it, so for Easter I put it in one of their easter baskets!"
positive,"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST: I wasn't sure that this would be a product that I would like. After recieving it and using it for a month now I absolutely love it. I was making a full pot using my bunn {which i still like} and end up thowing away at least half. there is no mess with this and you can adjust the strength of the coffee. My grandson uses it to make hot chocolate. My wife loves the variety of coffees. mocha, and teas available."
negative,"Two discs won't play.: Discs 6 and 11 won't play. Big damaged spots, you can see through the discs. Humbly request replacement or refund."
positive,"A great find!: I recently discovered this band while surfing the net.I sampled a few songs off their website,and I really loved Bemoaned Animosity.I wasn't sure if I'd like them that much,but wow was I wrong.Their tagline says it all,Death Trash Chaos!This cd has got to be one of my favorites,an instant classic for me.I find it difficult to compare them to other bands,as they have their own sound.My sister chuckled when she heard the name of the cd,but after she heard the title track,she was hooked and loves it as much as I do.It's certainly heavy,but blends thrash and death metal so well that I never really notice,cause I'm to busy head bangin'!"
positive,Finally...Irish food!: I don't know why it didn't occur to me earlier to try to find my favorite Irish breakfast foods on Amazon.This is great! You can get bangers too!I can make my favorite Ulster fry at home now!Thanks!
negative,"A Talented Cast Held Back by a Poor Script: The acting of Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx supplemented with the singing of Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce' - the makings of a great musical film, right? Unfortunately Dreamgirls does not deliver.The plot of Dreamgirls focuses on the struggle of a naive trio of talented young singers during the 1960's. Unfortunately the film focuses much of its attention on the root cause of all evil in the U.S. during this time period - white people. Seriously, the only time you see a caucasian or hear a reference to one during this film, it is to make the point that they racists or thieves who don't appreciate good music.In the end, I expected a lot more from this talented cast and therefore came away disappointed."
positive,"Underappreciated Classic That's Great Fun: When I read ""Miss Ravenel"" several years ago, I did not fully appreciate it--now that I'm very much into The War, I have a new outlook. Yes, it's dated, and to modern readers, the dialogue at times is corny and silly (as is DeForest's hesitancy to be more explicit about certain sexual matters). To me,though, that's part of the charm, along with its Victorian sentimentality. It's too bad it was not appreciated when it was published in 1867. Anyone interested in The War needs to read this--and keep in mind the fact that I'm a blue-blooded Southern boy."
positive,powerfully moving: one of the greatest summer blockbusters of all time Gladiator is action packed and kinetic. the opening scene is one of the best openings of a war movie ever. choreography is stellar. the fights in the colloseum are splendidly made. Russell Crowe excelently plays the general maximus a simple minded yet important man to the emperor of Rome.Forced to fight in the arena after the emperors son commodus kills maximus' wife and kid Gladiator doesn't run out of action. Joaquin Phoenix superbly plays his role. An evil self mannered man who just wants power in Rome. action packed with some of the best fight scenes around Gladiator packs a huge punch.
negative,"Not realistic in the least: If the producers knew anything about Deaf Culure they would have picked an actual deaf actress to play the role. It is not only offensive but is not even remotely realistic in showing what deafness and deaf culture is like. It only shows a helpless deaf girl who magically hears after getting a cochlear implant. Come on. It takes 3 months to heal after the surgery and even get the thing turned on and then years of speech therapy etc for it to be successful, IF its even successful. The actor was cute, I'll give them that much but isn't it time to let the Deaf act for themselves."
negative,"600 unnecessary pages.: While I am a BIG fan of the 'Earth's Children series and bought every volume, I was extremely disappointed in the final book 'Shelters of Stone'. Remove all the flowery scene descriptions and constant recapping of the previous 4 volumes and the book would have been no more than 100 pages. What a let down after such an incredible journey. I doubt a 6th volume would fill the void left by this blunder."
positive,Best of Film Noire: This is one of the very best of the genre. Right up there with the Maltese Falcon.
negative,"Poor Construction - Wires always breaking: THe connection to the Garmin 276C via this cable is at a 90 degree angle. It is not made well. This results in breakage of the wires at this point. The rest of the cable is made well and voice clarity is pretty good. I have given up with the ""pretty"" ""new"" look. The cable is held together with electrical tape, gum, and duct tape. I thought it was me at first so I replaced them. I don't what the designers were thinking. The unit is designed to be used both on the boat and in the car. It's moved around alot. Even with the greatest care breakage is inevitable. Despite the problems with the cable, I like the GPS very much. Unfortunately at a cost of $70.00 in stores (I've gone through 3 cables in a year), I will have to look to other products in future."
negative,"How Annoying! Total waste of money: I bought this book planning on checking the Feng Shui for my house for the year 2002 and find out after reading several chapters that Lillian Too assumes your house was built since 1984 or has had major renovation during this period. If this is not the case then the rest of the book (i.e. the most important part) is totally useless. Buy another book, any book except this one."
positive,"Excellent: My Trans-metropolitan counterpart beneath me definitely describes this cd well. I love the reference to Wallpaper, perhaps the greatest magazines ever (with Surface, Homme, and maybe Metropolitan Home) not far behind.But I digress... This cd, as with all of the releases in this series is excellent. Tosca's contribution is, of course, amazing. However, the entire width and breadth of this release is one that permanenty stays in the player.However, I would strongly urge you to seek out ""Volume Five"" of this series. It offers your senses two cd's of the finest Compost has to offer. I found it a local vendor, new, for an amazing price (under $15).A very, very worthwhile release...will not disappoint you."
negative,"Terrible Blu-Ray format -don't buy it!: For the Gladiator Blu-Ray Sapphire Series - got this unknowingly at the store, thinking it would be a vast improvement over my regular DVD and what a HUGE disappointment it was! I'm getting rid of it immediately - smudging was unbelieveably bad and quality overall was terrible. I can't believe anyone would release this as is and think it was a good idea. Thankfully I got on sale, wish I had checked though beforehand. Anyone who loves this movie definitely should stick with their regular DVD format until a better blu-ray comes along. Totally disgusted with this version!"
positive,"dual tuner is the way to go: I already have a single tuner TiVo with a lifetime subscription. We use it constantly and decided to get another box for the main tv. The dual-tuner won out for 2-tuners and built-in ethernet to connect to network. It has exceeded expectations and is very easy to use. The only thing that would be better is the Series 3 HD unit, but that is too expensive and we do not have and HD tv."
positive,"Google at $400.00? Hmmmm - maybe there are more chapters to write?: Keep this book within handy reach for any time that you're getting a bit too smart for your britches. How otherwise intelligent and rational folk get themselves into these troubles is truly fascinating and instructive. The writing here is, of course, rather archaic to modern sensibilities (originally published in 1841) but the stories are interesting and very readable. It's tempting to read the tales as history but when I see Goggle trading at over $400.00 I scratch my head and wonder. And when I hear the president cutting taxes, increasing spending, and still assuring me that my Social Security payments are secure, well, I think there might be a few chapters still waiting to be writing in the book. A good read."
positive,"Long overdue reissue of a beautifully strange pop album: Here's another great, overlooked art-school-rock classic finally released on CD. It's full of Ayers' odd lyrics and twisted tunes, and features a host of former Soft Machine mates and Island Records chums getting together to make some loopy, off-kilter rock'n'roll. Ayers' dark vision might be mistaken for depression in songs like ""Don't Let It Get You Down"" and ""Shouting In a Bucket Blues,"" but it's always redeemed by a sense of humor and wit (""When Your Parents Go To Sleep"" and ""Interview.""). The bonus tracks include ""Caribbean Moon,"" which had been available on the 1973 U.S. vinyl release. Fans of Soft Machine may be disappointed; this is rock, not jazz. Along with his marvelous 1974 album ""Confessions of Doctor Dream,"" this is some of the Seventies' most chic and sophisticated pop, as well as its most underrated."
negative,"Kindle edition has no links: The Kindle edition has NO hyperlinks in the document. It gets better.When you search on the word ""chapter,"" none of the chapter beginnings are found, supposedly because the chapter heading is an IMAGE, not text.I'll try other editions, and if needed, a download from Mobi, and report back on whether I can find a version of this book that can be used with a linked Table of Contents."
positive,"fun fun fun: my daughter loves to hide out in this thing, and then her little sis helps rip it apart and they start all over again. it's great for us cos we don't have a yard; a tree house alternative!"
negative,"Don't waste your money: D-Link DSM-320 Wireless Media Player, Audio/Photo/Video, 802.11gThis product appears to be running a linux-based OS, and will ""crash"" on any video file that is over 4 GB in size, and sometimes on smaller files. I was able to get a full refund after sending samples to their engineers who never fixed the problems. I replaced this unit with a LINKSYS WMCE54AG, which is a real Media Center Extender (and cost about $100 more) although it will randomly crash on occasion requiring a complete reboot by cycling power.It should be noted that none of these units is supported on WINDOWS VISTA: in the inimitable Microsoft fashion, VISTA will only support the XBOX 360 as a media center extender. This is why I still run the XP version of Media Center edition and have refused to ""upgrade"" to VISTA."
positive,Intex Twin Airbed: The two beds arrived quicker than I expected. They are very comfortable and blow up quickly. Getting all the air out to put it in its duffel bag took a little work but it fit. Easy to travel with when visiting friends.
negative,"Ho hum: The set up was teriffic. I read the sample, could barely wait for the download so that I could read something really well developed... And then I got to the other side where the whole thing dissolved into men killing men, lots of blood, an occasional generic female tossed in so that the bloody men could show the other bloody men that they got one. So predictable."
positive,"Classic film of epic proportions: Gladiator definitely deserved to win the Oscar. The film is magnificently put together from beginning to end. The drama and action compliment eachother quite well in this film, which is often hard to find in recent movies. The fight scenes are amazing, but are made even more amazing because of the drama and emotions that flow beneath the action. Russel Crowe is amazing in this film and definitely grabs the audience and brings them into this ancient civilization. Great on DVD as well, sound is impressive as well as the picture."
positive,"Not taught in 9th grade American History: This was a hard one to put down. In vivid but tight language, the story of the Essex is gripping and the details of the culture of whaling and the hard life at sea are intriguing and informative. In the end we get to see how religion, social position and greed play together to tell the grim sort of story we rarely acknowledge as part of our American history. Well worth the time and suitable for non-historians for its high adventure. It made me want a big steak."
negative,Book was not trimmed: The first copy of the book I received was not trimmed along the long side making it very difficult to turn the pages. I returned the book and received another one the next day (BTW Amazon's replacement policy is great and their customer service is awesome as well). The second copy of the book I received was also not trimmed along the long side. I was refunded for the book and purchased it elsewhere.
positive,"Incredible album...: Tre Hardson (of the Pharcyde), is without a doubt one talented individual...this album is incredible and should be owned by everyone interested in hip-hop and quality music...The only artist I can compare him to is K-os from Vancouver, BC...flows, lyrics, some singing...this is dope...and I listen to artists like Killah Priest, Billy Woods, Mr. Lif and Reef the lost Cauze. Peace"
negative,"oh how the mighty have fallen: The original Eloise was a sustained thrill. I have avoided all sequels until now for fear of just this sort of crashing disappointment. Think of the difference between Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, then multiply by ten. It is a bore. It is an embarassment. It is rawther godawful."
positive,not even for love: The book was very good and I would recommed this book to my friends. Sandra Brown is a good writer and story teller and I will continue reading her books
negative,"notorious for phantom paper jams: Mine worked well for the first year and then it started thinking that it had a paper jam. The printer would pick up a sheet of paper, feed it half way through then stop, saying there was a paper jam. There was no paper jam. The printer just thought there was. Upon doing a little research I discovered, much to my chagrin, that this is an all to common problem with this model. Do a search on 'HP Photosmart 2575 paper jam' and you'll see the same reviews I did. It's too bad that HP has not fixed the problem or even addressed it anywhere on their website.I've always liked HP products but you would be taking a big chance if you were to purchase this particular model. It might work fine but it might also render itself useless by the phantom paper jam. There's just no way to know which route your printer will take."
negative,"clay- not all hes craked up to be....: he sings good, but he sings bad songs, the only good song is The Way."
negative,"some retrograde moves: I still use Office 98 for the Mac. Why ? Because the newer versions of Excel are retrograde. Valuable keystrokes (eg Apple-D to fill down) are gone. Yes, I agree that versions 9 and 10 of all Office applications have an improved ""appearance"", but WHY do they take OUT useful features for USERS ???? Newer versions are supposed to advance the effectiveness of the users. Did M$T forget this principle?"
positive,"The pleasure of ethical paradox: Social satire has ever been an interesting and delightful way to discover and examine the basics of human behaviour and believing, both to show the weakness of logic and the strength of hypocrisy of many rules and customs. Butler, in his novel, developes this theme as a XIX century writer can do. The result is a pleasing reading, made a bit difficult by a slightly obsolete style and too much care of details, which sometimes gives some obstacles to thread. An example of how, about half a century later, a writer could have faced the same subject is given by new world by Huxley. The book is nonetherless quite readable, and an example of the high level tradition in which Butler can stand together with Swift."
negative,"CAVEAT EMPTOR: I RECEIVED AN ITEM THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THROWN IN A DUMPSTER , AND SOLD TO ME AS A ACCEPTABLE WORKING ITEM, HMMM THEN WHEN BROUGHT TOO THEIR ATTENTION IT WAS BLAMED ON A NEW EMPLOYEE ERROR, CONVENIENT ! ?IT'S QUITE A LENGTHY ORDEAL AND IM SURE ITS NOT A PRODUCT ISSUE IN ITSELF JUST A CASE OF POOR AND IGNORANT MANAGEMENT...... I WILL NOT CONDACEND FURTHER BUT WILL DEFINITELLY NOT DEAL WITH WISEUP PRODUCTS EVER IN THE FUTURE AND SUGGEST YOU THINK TWICE BEFORE DOING SO......BUYER BEWARE, !!!"
positive,"Breakthrough Album: For those who enjoy the electronica/club type music, Moby has put out an album we all can enjoy. All tracks are good-sounding, maybe not lyrically enlightening, but a good album to simply hear. Forget listening to it, but most music of this genre isn't really big on lyrics. Overall, a good purchase--worth the purchase price"
negative,"Digital version does not include the short stories: I did enjoy the unfinished story, although it its of course sad that we can never enjoy the fully finished work. I was very frustrated to learn that the Kindle digital version did not include the two companion short stories. Seeing their mention time and again in these reviews, I had no idea they would be left out. These were the deciding factor in my decision to purchase this book. This should have been noted in the description."
positive,"A mix of history and hollywood: I caught this movie on WGN afternoon movie a few weeks ago. I have been to Cocoa Beach and took the NASA then and now tour featuring many of the sites in this movie.This movie moves along pretty fast and is entertaining as well as informitive for kids about early NASA history even though it really is just a hollywood movie.Not to be missed, a great family film."
positive,"Rick Schroeder was impressive!: Until NYPD Blue did I ever see Ricky Schroeder in a dramatic roll as an adult. I loved him in that show, as did I in ""Hostage High."" He acted the part extremely well. His facial expressions and blank stares during the movie were eerie. Just like that of an actual crazed killer. Yet he also showed the confused and caring side of this person Jason Copeland.I only wish they would have given more detail about the real incident and people involved. The end of the movie sort of left me hanging,wanting to know more about the actual event and the life of the actual killer."
negative,Dry but not the best choice for size 1: Props:- The diaper actually does a good job on dry out.Cons:- It is too thin to hold watery poop- It does not have a wetness indicator.Definitely not a good choice for new parents. I will probably buy it when the baby older than 6 months because it's cheaper than others.
positive,"Bebel Gilberto does it again!: Along with Ceu she is one of my favorite Brazilian singers and have to say, bought this one more hoping for the best. After her previous releases I thought to myself ""Well it cant get better than this"" and while maybe I can't say she has improved this is still up there with the rest of her releases.Soft vocals over an almost African rhythm that just blend together so well. Yeh this is quality lounge music, this is music for the summer, long lazy days having a drink with friends, just being alone after a hard day or a long drive.Probably the only thing I dislike on this CD are when she sings in English. Give me that Portuguese any day!"
positive,"Salve for the Soul: The prose is fluid and beautiful. The characters are like people you may know. These are life stories, told across time and place, successfully drawing you in to consider various perspectives and possibilities. Like a prism, the book reveals many colors; no situation is black and white.This is adult and young-adult fiction at its best. Finally, a book that invites discussion across the generations on real-life topics including moral dilemmas. The ""open"" ending is a reflection of the overarching theme: people write their own life stories."
negative,"Yet another anti-Catholic propagandist has surfaced: It is sad that the author undermines what could be a legitimate plot and wastes no time to subdue it by pushing his personal anti- Catholic, pro-abortion agenda, in the most offensive of terms."
negative,"Eastern Western: Entertaining, low buget western. Plot a little hard to follow. Not exactly Terence Hill's best movie. Watch it."
negative,"Make it Stop!: My roomate bought this dvd, thinking that it would be fun and mindless, along the lines of Bring It On or such. It was a terrible disapointment. We were prepared for chics dancing on bars and related craziness, but it was actually a slow-moving story about a country girl who moves to the Big Apple to become a songwriter but is afraid to sing in public. By the end you will be begging her to sing the (explicative deleted) song! In conclusion, make another selection at the video store!"
negative,"Motorola battery and battery cover: I needed a battery and thought I would try the bigger extended battery. A waste of time and money. The battery worked great but the replacement cover and the 2nd replacement cover did not come close to fitting. I like the phone, but ended up replacing it. I gave it 2 stars because the battery itself, seemd to be OK. Other wise I would be looking for a minus."
negative,"I only gave it a star because I had to.: This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good. If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown, they can actually write!"
negative,"not my cup of tea.: I fell in love with the strung out sound when I first heard the album ""suburban teenage wasteland blues"". The albums energy was intense throughout. Every track was great. The next album, ""twisted by design"" was also quite energetic but only with a couple slower, average tunes (Still well worth the price). I was eagerly awaiting the next strung out offering. This release, however, was quite disapointing. I can't put to words what's wrong with it. There is still some energy there, but the hard edge is gone. They have progressed I suppose, but their sound has transformed into something I don't much care for. I should give only one star, but I'll give two just because their past albums were so excellent. I will be curious to hear the next one, but I won't rush out and but it. I'll probably dl a few tracks to see which direction they're going in first."
positive,"The way singles should be...: All four of the b-sides on this album could've appeared on ""The Man Who."" I actually like a couple of them more than the single ""Writing to Reach You.""""Green Behind the Ears"" is a good pulsating rocker that also makes a good singalong song. ""Only Molly Knows"" (which wasn't a hidden track on my copy of ""The Man Who"") is a brillant acoustic endeavor that follows a unique song structure of repeating the name ""Molly"" twice in each verse. ""Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah"" sounds like a Beatles outtake, with Fran taking on the role of a ""Helter Skelter""-esque Paul McCartney. Another great track. The last track, ""High as a Kite,"" is also exceptional in its call-and-response chorus.Believe me, even if you just own ""The Man Who,"" if you ever come across this single, get it! A great single and four excellent b-sides! What more could you ask for?"
negative,"Oh my god this is pathetic!: I didn't think it was actually possible to make a movie worse then The Mummy. But when I rented this utter fiasco of a movie that is what I got. It actually offended me because it was so insulting to the intelligence of the person watching. Weak characters, terrible acting, cheesy special effects, and don't even get me started about the screenplay. I am dumbfounded that this movie was ever made, and I am floored by the fact it made 180 million at the box office. There is one nice thing about the movie though, Rachel Weisz's cleavage."
negative,"Does not work well with Windows XP: Windows XP includes a utlility that allows setup of a wireless network card. This card is not recognized by XP as such, and the setup is next to impossible. Sent mine back and bought a different brand."
negative,"THE WORLD OF HAMMER, VAMP: A huge disappointment!! If you are looking for the surreal eroticism and nudity, that was so much a part of the Hammer Vampire movies, this is a complete waste. What I got was 25 minutes of G rated clips, that skillfully avoided the erotic nature of these films."
negative,Xantrex Powerpack 600: Worked great when first received and was used less than 20 hours total. Unit died within days after warranty expired. Contacted manufacturer and was told they are not repairable but offered to sell me another one for the same price.
positive,"Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!: This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$."
negative,"Terrible: This product was so awful, I returned it - something I RARELY do. It didn't dry or straighten well. My dryer and round brush were far superior to using this. I don't recommend this product."
negative,"blu-ray compatibility: After purchasing the Avatar blu-ray/standard dvd set, I will never buy another blu-ray until the studios get their act together vis-a-vis formats. The Avatar blu-ray can't play on any of my blu-ray players because the format is not compatible! So now we have different formats of the blu-ray format! How convoluted will this format become! It was an expensive lesson to learn. If not for the included standard version, I would not have been able to view this film at all. Thank you very little, F___ you very much - to all who were responsible for this marketing disaster!"
negative,"GoFit 75cm Pro Stability Ball: The worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon. First it wasn't even the ball I bought. It was a Diff. model than the one shown on the screen. The ball has stupid Cartoon Characters doing exercises on the ball, which I now realize that you show a diif. ball because that one would never sell. Do not buy this ball save your money."
negative,"NOT ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN !!!!!!!: One star rating for the DVD version the studio released, not the movie. The box says ""Enhanced for widescreen TVs"", but the only parts that fill the screen of my 1080p HD widescreen are the menus. So if you got an ""old"" TV, you're good to go. If your DVD player puts out a 480p signal, you can fill your 1080 screen (with letterbox on top & bottom), but then this is just a crummy looking video picture. Nothing ""special"" about that. So if 20th Century Fox knew enough to make the menus HD widescreen compatible, then why not the film? Especially since the release is advertised as ""Enhanced for widescreen TVs"". Seems pretty deceptive to me."
positive,Great Deal!!: Great deal!! They arrived in less time than quoted to my door! You just can't go wrong with Pampers and I am loving Amazon!! :)
negative,"Dreadful performance: I expected so much better from the great Andre Previn. This version of the greatest programmatic orchestral music of all time is simply terrible -- utterly uninspired and passionless, both in the solo piano and orchestral versions. The tone is muddy throughout, and I don't think it's the engineering: pianist and orchestra just seem listless in a piece that should leave listeners awed and thrilled. The pacing is all wrong. No definition in the percussion. The brasses sound bored. Listening to this is like reading Cliff Notes of War and Peace. Either the performers didn't understand this music or they didn't care. The best version remains Toscanini's with the NBC Symphony Orchestra: even with 1950s recording technology, scorchingly brilliant."
negative,"Does not work with Windows XP: The device is rated as Windows XP compatable, but it is not. After fruitless hours of trying to get this piece of garbage installed I gave up. Simpletech's web site and tech support are a joke! All I ended up with was constant crashes and error messages. Save your money."
negative,"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IBOOK G4: I'm sure this product is great for G4 Powebooks and G3 iBooks, but nowhere in this product description does it say that this adapter is NOT for use with iBook G4s. I tried this on my iBook G4, and the computer kept switching back and forth between battery power and the power supply from the adapter. I'm returning this to Amazon tomorrow, but am upset that I wasted $20 overnighting this adapter because I absolutely need to use my computer this weekend. I wish they would update the product description to make it explicit that this is for Powerbook G4s and iBook G3s ONLY."
positive,"Great for kids!: As usual, Thomas and Friends are entertaining in all the best ways for kids! Good lessons and good fun."
positive,"Lord of the Flies: I really enjoyed William Goldings novel Lord of the Flies. It was adventurous, tragic, and very convincing. If you like novels that start off shaky with a high climax and end not happy but not sad you'll love Lord of the Flies."
positive,"Superb!: Impressive spiritual journeys and around the world. Heart-pounding, fast-paced! You just can't put it down! A brilliant biography! Can't be missed!"
positive,Angels by Billy Graham: Great and enjoyable book to read. Only way to find out is to purchase the book. So I recommend anyone to buy it...
positive,"With great characters comes great books: Essential reading for marvel fans...better, for COMIC'S FANS!A short description and images of EVERY character showed in this book (over a 1000) made it a must-have piece for every collector!Good texts, amazing draws, fine paper...excellent buy!"
negative,"This book had no point!: Up to this point, I had looked forward to Jean Auel's books. However, after reading her latested installment I was very disappointed. Yes, she has always been wordy but it seemed the whole book was that way. By the time I was halfway through the book, I was wondering where it was going and I found out at the end. NOWHERE!! What a waste of time and money. This was one of those books that you finish and then say to yourself ""Is THAT it?""..."
positive,"Outstanding: This is wonderful. I wish these folks were around, young, andon the Radio and Screen today. Put this on DVD PLEASE, my VHS tape will wear out fromintroducing todays kids to these folks."
positive,"Harry Potter and the Bovlet of Fire: Great movie, My family enjoys all of the Harry Potter movies.I can't say enough also about Amazon.com, great selection, prices and service. A wonderful experience."
negative,"don't read my review, just leave this page for your own good: Don't be fool with the nice cover of the movie, this is not Indiana jones or something even near it. It's the wort archeological action movie ever made. It's awful, low budget with terrible actings. it's special features is as poor as the early 20s movies!and the DVD, it's even worse than the movie. a single layer dvd, the picture quality is awful, not sharp, with very pale colors. it was better if they transfer it in black and white. I Did not watch it till the end cause I love my eyes."
positive,"Just like the store, but cheaper: The title pretty much says it all. If you can order enough and ahead of time to get free shipping they're same as the store but cheaper."
positive,"Eye-opening must read: Awesome, brave, chilling, provocative, challenging...Mr. Jensen has significantly changed the way I look at our world, my community, my direct and indirect interaction with all life. This should be read by everyone interested in saving our planet -it rings with common sense and in a unique and personal voice challenges each and every one of us to stop and listen...and demands of each and every one of us to ACT before it is too late. I will be sharing this book with as many people as I can; I will tell people about this book; I hope every library in North America stocks this book. Profound...cannot wait to read more of Mr. Jensen's thoughts. Buy it, then buy a second copy to lend."
negative,Not great!: I'm disappointed in these diapers. My daughter frequently wakes up in the morning covered in clumps of gel from inside the diaper. It's not hurting anything but it's a pain to clean up.
positive,"small circle jujitsu book review: Great techniques and lots of them. Very good introduction to the world of jujitsu. The issue I had was that many of the pictures were somewhat far away and you can't clearly see how the technique is specifically executed. Also, some of the written descriptions assume baseline knowledge of the technique."
positive,"Worth the money: The only reason I did not give this a 5 was because it seems loose in the camera, but it does work great, and the price, well, you can't beat it. I purchased two of them."
positive,"Great classic intro to Holy Scripture: We read and understood the stories in this book when we were two years old -- they were that simple and clear. Elsie Egermeier did a great job interpreting Holy Scripture for tiny kids without getting pedantic or avoiding the facts. While it contains both Old and New Testaments, it is suitable for Jewish children. I would choose this book over the smarmy ""Uncle Arthur's"" or any other retelling of Bible stories for kids. Bring back the old edition, with its classy dark cover with the famous portrait of Christ on it."
positive,"Can it get better?: Dave has outdone himself with this album. This is his third ""solo"" album on the independant label he runs in Iowa City called Trailer Records. Dave can sound like rock n roll, folk, Alt-Country, and bluesy among other unknown or unnamed styles. The Big Night explores these different musical styles and puts them together to form his unique sound. If you like Bob Dylan, Greg Brown, Todd Snider, The Rolling Stones, or any similar atists you should give this album a try."
positive,"A little raw....: This is a good album but some of the tracks are a little raw, as it were. ""Revenge"" is rather brutal (though rather mild next to Attempted Mustache's ""Clockwork Chartreuse""), ""Ingenue"" is lecherous and ""April Fools Day Morn"" rather pathetic. But as with all good LW3 material, even these songs have humor to take the edge off (or add it, as needed).As I said, it's a good album. The artist would do increasingly better from here, however. (This album is from 1982, by the way, not 1989.)"
negative,"buyer beware...this product and the company are a rip-off: this is a terrible product from a company that should not be in business. the scooter never worked...their solution was to send me a couple of neew components nad have me install. when that did not work, they had me run test after test after test...to no avail. the scooter does not work to this day. i filed a complaint with amazon...amazon did a lousy job of investigating and determined that the warranty was expired (30 day warranty!). of course it expired...they took a week each time to respond to my requests for help. the warranty was half over by the time i got the scooter after ordering it. i am disputing the charge through my credit card company, hope that gets my money back. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, I BELIEVE YOU WILL EXPERIECE THE SAME THINK I DID.BUYER BEWARE!!!BUYER BEWARE!!!"
positive,"Beautiful, simply beautiful...: Summer of My German Soldier is an absolutely wonderful book. The emotions and phases that run through the mind of Patricia Bergen are so real, and perhaps a bit similar to my own at times, that you'd think that the Patty truly lived in every aspect of human life. Patty is at times naive, but is mostly brave, a might defient, and loving. I recommend this book to any fellow young lady from nine to seventeen. It's wonderful."
positive,Christmas Carol: Christmas Carol is a classic that I think everyone should read. It will change the view on which many people see Christmas. It will also give even the most stingy person the Christmas spirit.
positive,Great Read: Well done book that all school kids can read. These are books that get them back into reading instead of watching TV.
negative,truly awful: i bought this CD for the musicians that play on these two albums. big mistake. dreadful pap that makes Debby Boone sound like Janis Joplin. avoid at all costs.
positive,Great artistry: I have loved Karen's inspiring singing since her first album in 1997. This one is just as good. I just hope that Missy and the rest of the RnB bunch that frequent the latest offerings of the Clark Sisters really do mean what they preach.
positive,Awesome Lip Gloss: I have darker complexion and this is color is great for me! The lip gloss is perfect - it goes on smoothly and lasts for a while. I would recommend NARS lip gloss and this color to everyone.
negative,"Greatest Generalization: Brokaw delves into the world of what he calls the ""Greatest Generation"", whom were a group of people that watched Hitler's reign of terror on the world, until the United States was Forced into war. Brokaw's so called ""greatest generation"" ARE STILL racist, uncultured and ignorant to world issues. I'd rather read the back of a shampoo bottle than this lie. If you want to know about great generations, skip Brokaw's maligned view and head straight for ""on the road"" or ""electric cool aid acid test""."
positive,"The more, the merrier!: Having an extra cradle/charger is very useful if your like me and would like to sync up at both home and work. The cradle itself is excellent. Although the Jornada 545 also has a USB connection, it is not nearly as fast as the iPaq's (makes me question whether the HP's connection is -really- USB)."
negative,"Deserves 1 start except introduced me to Julia: Everything about this book is pretty terrible: narcissistic, whiny, boring. Anybody with a blog seems to get a book deal. So you cooked her recipes for a year, big deal. Julia actually wrote those recipes and retested them and used them for a lifetime, not as a gimmick. But it was a gift and so I dutifully read it because I like to cook and it introduced me to Julia Child so I must say thanks for that. It led me to read My Life in France a few years ago (Julia's memoir)which I loved but now I am reading Dearie, a well written biography about Julia's whole life, not just the happy bits in France, by Bob Spitz. If you want inspiration in cooking, read either of these, not Julie and Julia!"
negative,"Violent.: This movie is full of violence every 5 minutes and should not be viewed by anyone. The director of this film, who is now dead, was definitely on some kind of trip when he made this film. It is a total waste of film and should be destroyed. Don't waste your money or time ..."
negative,"This book's title is misleading.: This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase."
negative,"Sports Illustrated book of fencing: 90 pages short. Not much bigger than a paperback. Covers epee, foil, and sabre, so about 30 pages for your type of fencing. Technically accurate but not worth the money for such a short tomb."
negative,"Unpleasant and Unconvincing: I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to evolutionary ideas but I simply found this book unpleasant and unconvincing. The authors derided many scientists who don't seem to agree with them. That's pretty arrogant since the idea of evolutionary symbiosis seems overstated and many related arguments weak. For example, the authors assert that many terms such as ""group selection"" are pseudoscientific. That's code for ""I don't agree with it"" which only means the authors don't really understand it. Another sentence, for example, refers to a ""student-infested house"". Why pounce on students? Do the authors think that's cute or funny? To assert their own ideas, they also denigrate Darwin and present him as some muddy thinker. Oh please! Even though Acquiring Genomes has a 150 year head-start on Darwin's Origin of the Species, the latter is still a much more convincing read."
negative,"... Ever After: C'mon. We've all read this stuff before: E.Lynn Harris. Bebe Moore Campbell. Terry McMillan. Ad Nauseum. And most have done it better. I don't know any black people who talk or act like these characters. They were like cardboard cartoon people. For all of her talk about ""cutting off"" her hair, Venus still was NOT NAPPY!! She had finely textured hair, for goodness sakes! She was even compared to Jada Pinkett by one of her close friends! The title was a ..., and I felt cheated as I read the book. As a matter of fact, I skipped to the end. Don't buy it, rent it from the library if you must."
negative,"head in the crapper: The people are pretty, the settings are pretty. The entire first half of the film is devoted to gratuitious sex -- gratuitous because there's no chemistry between the lovers OR between them and the audience. Why would hedonistic Gilda fall for an intellectual cypher like Guy? Why wouldn't he be infatuated with the sex, thinking he was in love with her? I WANTED the erotic scenes to move me; they didn't. G&G move in together, life is boring. Mia moves in, life gets giggly. War approaches, Guy and Mia are suddenly impassioned by it rather than Gilda, who pouts. Yaddayaddayadda. No suspense, no depth of character, blahblahblah. I think the fault lies mostly with really poor directing and editing. Can't believe Theron performed like a such ham after her previous roles. Penelope tried and failed to overcome the script. Probably a 17-year-old would think the story everything that it isn't -- exciting, romantic, sexy, deep....."
negative,Good Idea that Didn't Pan Out: I got this album after hearing Jorge Ben's great music on Africa Brasil. I checked around and read that this was a good one to get. I've got to say that I was disappointed. It all just sounds a bit off. The singing is slightly out of tune enough to drive you crazy and the music never really takes off like I had read it would. Try Africa Brasil for a real taste of Jorge Ben or Tropicalia 2 if you are looking for Gilberto Gil.
positive,"Great Product: This has entertained and entertained our little boy for 6 months - he just loves watching, listening and pushing the buttons."
positive,"It really works!: Thanks to Viki King and this great book, I did it! Although I altered the plan a little to fit my schedule (read: it took a little longer than 21 days), her plan works. Check it out for yourself."
negative,"Dull, dull, dull. Slog you way thru. If you can.: Disappointing. Very. Nothing happens. Huxley pontificates. Spare me. Can see why he's only known for one book. Skip this one."
negative,awesome movie no real 3d: one of the worst 3d acquisitions in my library. already had this on dvd. movie was originally releases in imax 3d but this conversion stinks. don';t waste your money for it if wanted too add to your 3d library.don't take this the wrong way. i love the movie but 3d is a waste. i own other 3d movies (almost every title in blu ray 3d). and this one and darkest hour are the worst.
positive,""". . .The Internationale Unites The Human Race . . ."": This is Jack Reed's well-written but highly partisan and pro-Bolshevik eyewitness account of the Russian Revolution. Reed's Soviet Socialist biases drip from every page like an oily coating, and this may irritate readers who are not quite so utopian as was Reed. TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD is all but useless as an objective history of the event, but it is extraordinarily useful as a subjective interpretation of the birth of the first Communist state, and therefore, it is an interesting, fascinating, and valuable document well worth reading."
negative,VERY DISAPPOINTED: I RECENTLY GOT THE SET AND USED THEM ON DRILLING PILOT HOLES IN SHEET METAL TO GO ON A TRAILER HOUSE. THEY ARE DULL TO START WITH AND GET DULL VERY FAST. THEY ARE NOT COBALT AND WOULD RATHER HAVE JUST A MILL OF THE RUN HSS BITS. WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK. ROD
negative,"hate this new format: I didnt realize when I ordered it that the type was turned side ways. I bought this as a gift, but not sure I will give it.I guess someone might like the format, but I dont."
positive,"Can't Beat This Set For The $$$: We purchased this set as a low-end option to replace the Dell set that my husband reclaimed to go with his new flat screen monitor. As is everyone, we are watching the pennies right now, and looked at this set as a compromise between price and quality. It was to accompany the CRT monitor that I inherited from him along with his old Dell computer. After we received it and have been using it for about two months, I am VERY happy to say that there is absolutely NO COMPROMISE when it comes to performance, quality of the sound and appearance. It matches my other Dell components perfectly and I am THRILLED with my system now. My husband is pleased that I do not hog HIS computer any more. Price was great, delivery was speedy and we are very pleased."
negative,"Shelters of Stone: After waiting 11 years I was really disappointed. It seemed that everytime someone new was introduced, it took three paragraphs to tell who they were. Maybe Jean Auel will have another book out in about 20 years and by then I won't be around to read it. A very drawn out tale, not what I had expected."
positive,"The Hobbit-Revisited: It has been quite a few years since my first reading of the Hobbit and since I have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and seen the movies numerous times. Going back and re-reading the Hobbit as a part of working my way through NPR's list of the Top 100 SciFi books of all times was a little disappointing. By comparison to the subsequent LOTR series, The Hobbit seemed to lack a cohesives story and had a less than complete ending. It falls short in comparison to LOTR in scope, somewhat in detail and in a unifying theme other than being a unique tale set in an imaginary world populated by strange beings.All that said, I would recommend that you certainly start with this book before reading the LOTR series as I think if you read The Hobbit after LOTR you may be disappointed."
positive,"Great conclusion to a great series: A great conclusion to a great series. If you enjoyed the first two films in the series, this a must-watch."
positive,"Out With The Old, In With The New!: This is it! I'm done looking for quality cookware. This snazzy cookware set is perfect for anybody and any family! Buy it. You'll be happy. We also purchased a few hundred more dollars worth of cookware pieces to go with this set that replaced our old ""pre-baby/poor college kid"" pieces!"
negative,"What utter drek.: I was excited to read this book, what with all of the praise I had heard for the 17-year-old that had written. How disappointed was I. This is, without an ounce of doubt, the most poorly written book I have ever regrettably paid money for. Shoddy characters, a splotchy story, and an over all plot that seems to pull from other fantasy writers that are much, much better than he is. Honestly, I cannot believe how many mistakes he made while writing his story. I just wanted to take a red pen and scribble out whole pieces of useless details.If you want to read an adolescent fantasy novel, go read The Golden Compass, or a Wrinkle in Time. Don't even bother touching trash like this."
negative,"Israeli bootleg. Don't bother with this one unless you like blurry kung fu.: While the movie itself is okay. This DVD is a RIPOFF!! It looks like a grainy youtube video. It's Blurry... pixelated... mono sound. This DVD also states on the box ""more Israeli films available at [...]"". Just a heads up as to where your money is really going if you buy this. Save your money and wait for an official release."
positive,Maynard you are missed: Maynard one of the finest Band leader/trumpet player know to man.Few people are of the calliper to be a Legend as Maynard became.
negative,"Not good: If I hadn't promised to review this book for our school library, I would have stopped reading after the first chapter. This book is not well written, nor are the characters or subplots believable. I can't think of a single student I have ever had who I would recommend this book to. Very disappointing."
negative,"Clay's Voice Should Be the Music: I absolutely love Clay's voice, and I couldn't wait for the release of this disappointing debut. But the nuances of his voice that make it so phenomenal are hidden underneath the ""music."" I would rather hear Clay singing acappella or singing just about anything other than these songs. Why cover up such a beautiful voice?"
negative,"Great Idea That Did Not Work: I bought two of these at Christmas time. The idea is great and thought they would be good in the cars. The first problem was that none of the tips would fit my Motorola C261 phone. Then I tried it on a Nokia 2600. Although there was a tip that fit perfectly, when I tried to charge the phone the phone screen said STOP and had a little stop sign on it. So I assume the volts were not correct. The flash lite has two setting and worked great. Returned the items as did not work for me."
negative,WASTE OF TIME: I REALLY FELT I WASTED MY TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE/THIS MOVIE REALLY DOESNT BECOME A HORROR MOVIE UNTIL SHE GETS RAPES THEN TAKES A VERY BRUTAL AND BLOODY REVENGE/THE BAD PART IS BY THE TIME THAT HAPPENS YOU ARE DEAD TIRED OF IT OR ALREADY ASLEEP/A VERY GOOD ENDING BUT OVERALL TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
negative,A real joke to the ANOES series: This was a movie turned into a movie that has to be a real joke to the series. This was a movie where the original stars of the first movie have trouble with Freddy and then Freddy comes to the real world and then kills people. The weird part of this movie was how director Wes Craven made the movie like a documentary of Freddy's life instead of a sequel. The special effects weren't too good nor bad either but you could see why the special effects were mediocre because of the low budget. Freddy would star in his next movie Freddy Vs Jason that was a lot better than this.
positive,The Complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classics: This collection of religious topics gives great insight into the Christian religion. I encourage every person who is wondering about christianity and it's teachings to read this book.
positive,"Disco ball light: I never write reviews, but I have to say I took a gamble and got this for my daughters birthday. It blew the lightbulb just like the other review stated, pretty much within 5-10 minutes. We just went to Home Depot the next day and got another bulb. It works great, just the initial bulb issue. I would just have another one handy so its not an initial disappointment if this does happen."
positive,"A Charming Classic: I felt this story would be a good one as soon as I started reading it. It is practically effortless to read, but offers so much wit and is endlessly engrossing. I have fallen in love with this family; they seem unbelievably wonderful to me. I am glad the authors (two of the twelve Gilbreth children) gave each character its own charming personality without making the story too complicated and definately not dull. The Gilbreth's excursions and adventures will steal your heart, from father's eccentric motion studies to Anne's fashion frustrations. I feel this book is capable of charming any reader of any age. Enjoy!"
